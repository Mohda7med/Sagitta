man biagio 's just have the good donut ever
do not talk to -PRON- about krispy kreme and those do not even sound good by the way donut be not suppose to be krispy or dunkin or amy joy
none of those other can even compare to the lovely donut make fresh at biagio 's
unfortunately -PRON- family think -PRON- be funny to get a few dozen of these baby about once a week
and -PRON- always eat 2 of -PRON- because well -PRON- be tubby
and -PRON- just can not resist -PRON-
-PRON- be the fresh most delicious donut -PRON- will ever taste
and really this be all come from someone who be not that big of a donut fan in the first place
totally worth the drive across the river to bfeastlake to get -PRON- donut fix
-PRON- have never have chicken and waffle before come to lo lo 's and now -PRON- be a staple for -PRON- saturday morning hangover routine also a great place to go when people come to visit
the food be southern style comfort food and everything -PRON- have try be delicious
the service be just ok and -PRON- do get busy on the weekend but totally worth -PRON- anyway
chicken and waffle be -PRON- favorite thing on the menu can not go wrong
not all jm 's be the same
but if -PRON- be in the area and be look for a food option that may not have a drive through but keep -PRON- away from the deep fryer which -PRON- can find at 80 of -PRON- other food option in the area stop by this location
angie have the good personality and sparkle smile every time -PRON- stop in
kealon have that positive energy and welcome attitude -PRON- look for each and every time
stop in and do not forget to check in on yelp to grab a free cookie coupon while -PRON- be at -PRON-
kinda underwhelm
go for saturday morning brunch and get the shepherds biscuit
sound interesting but end up be flavorless and disappointing
order a latte and -PRON- come out lukewarm
plus -PRON- be so confused with the way -PRON- order here
-PRON- give -PRON- name at the cashier and then wait to order and get -PRON- seat after
probably make sense when -PRON- be really busy but when -PRON- be not -PRON- be just confusing
and the employee do not help explain -PRON- much to -PRON- who be obviously confused
-PRON- be a beautiful and fun space -PRON- be just a not excited about the new tenant
david be awesome
-PRON- live in an old home -PRON- recently have re landscape
-PRON- choose sprinkler repair base upon yelp
review
david be very responsive address -PRON- question
-PRON- have an exist sprinkler system modify and some outdoor lighting repair
tim abel and another gentleman do the work
tim be professional knowledgeable and do everything -PRON- say -PRON- would do and more
-PRON- would highly recommend -PRON- and would not hesitate to use -PRON- in the future
this be probably -PRON- favorite fry chicken place in the valley
way better than the other big national chain
the staff be great but not so sure -PRON- could say the second about the drink -PRON- order
perhaps -PRON- be too strong but the iced americano -PRON- order be extremely bitter that -PRON- throw -PRON- out after a couple of sip
-PRON- would like to give this place a second try
but -PRON- be debate -PRON-
very poor service
make an appointment for 10 am and bring car in for emission test and oil change
after check out the car for an hour or so -PRON- advise -PRON- that -PRON- need new brake
-PRON- approve that repair and ask for the shuttle
-PRON- could not find the shuttle so -PRON- son come and pick -PRON- up now -PRON- be 11:45
at the end of the day -PRON- car be ready so -PRON- son drive -PRON- back
-PRON- do not have the emission certificate and when -PRON- ask for -PRON- aaa tell -PRON- -PRON- do not need -PRON-
-PRON- insist and -PRON- print -PRON-
when -PRON- get back home -PRON- realize -PRON- be not for -PRON- car
-PRON- emission also have not be enter onto the state 's website so -PRON- could not renew -PRON- registration
when -PRON- call aaa -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- have to bring the car back
so -PRON- could hook -PRON- up to the machine -PRON- think -PRON- never do the test initially but -PRON- do charge -PRON-
another hour of waiting and after -PRON- 3rd round trip with another emission certificate in hand this one for -PRON- car -PRON- again try the state registration website
nothing
the car do pass emission
-PRON- be friday evening by this point
next day saturday -PRON- try again to renew car 's registration
nothing
-PRON- fill out an online form to the state to ask the state agency what to do in this case and notice that aaa have not enter -PRON- car 's vin correctly on the emission certificate
so -PRON- call aaa again and guess what
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- have to bring the car back again
so -PRON- could run another emission test
-PRON- pay aaa $ 500 for repair oil change and emission and have to make 4 round trip to -PRON- shop over 2 day so -PRON- could correct -PRON- multiple emission test error
no refund coupon shuttle help
not worth the hassle
just get two order of baked mostacciolli
one be obviously bad by the overwhelming smell when -PRON- open the lid
-PRON- offer to send -PRON- another order but by now the damage be do
will not order from here again
good luck
super fun store to shop at while in vegas
the chocolate tasting be a neat thing to do while in there as well
-PRON- also eat at the restaurant
super clean love the style and the service be the good
the table get chicken and waffle jambalaya and a fish dish
all the food be really good
-PRON- husband love jambalaya and say this be the good one -PRON- ever have
the chocolate cheesecake be amazing
-PRON- hear on facebook that -PRON- one of the good taco place in vegas so -PRON- finally try -PRON-
-PRON- have friendly employee
-PRON- order 4 carne asada taco to go with everything on -PRON-
everything on -PRON-
but -PRON- do not come with guacamole
-PRON- make handmade tortilla
-PRON- be good
but the carne asada meat be bland and not juicy
the taco be pretty much tasteless and dry
-PRON- think not 100 sure
-PRON- because -PRON- cook a big batch whenever and just let -PRON- sit there unlike other taco place
$ 2.50 per taco decent price for the size but -PRON- can get with the same price better season and freshly cook carne asada meat with guacamole at pepe 's or tacos el gordo and -PRON- cook the meat there when -PRON- get order and not make big batch
decide to try -PRON- the other night since -PRON- be around the corner from the house
delicious food quick service an overall good experience
-PRON- sample the sausage lasagna the veal parmesan and fettuccine alfredo
-PRON- think the food be quite good
a decent if not small wine list
-PRON- notice another yelper make a comment about pedestrian at good and that -PRON- son who have restaurant experience and be now attend a premier culinary school pronounce the sauce as something from a can
-PRON- father in law be italian and make -PRON- own sauce from scratch so -PRON- be pretty sure that be not the case
no offense to -PRON- however if that garden place be olive garden then that say -PRON- all
of course everyone be entitle to -PRON- opinion
personally -PRON- will go back the next time -PRON- be look for italian food
so good and so bad at the same time
the good
-PRON- can reserve -PRON- exact seat in advance
-PRON- love this because i hate have to worry that -PRON- will not get good seat and have to show up early to make sure -PRON- get -PRON-
-PRON- can order drink or food right at -PRON- seat
-PRON- think this be both good and bad actually because -PRON- be on a diet and could not eat anything but -PRON- have to smell not just popcorn but now hamburger wing fry etc
not the good experience when -PRON- be try not to eat unhealthy stuff or when -PRON- just do not feel like smell food
the seat be very comfortable and large than regular seat
the bad
this theater have see good day the shine and polish be go
have server move around during the movie be a little distracting
-PRON- be a movie fanatic and -PRON- hate anything disrupt -PRON- state of suspend disbelief
unless -PRON- be go to the epicentre for something else or walk there which -PRON- do parking be a little bit of a pain
-PRON- go in just to get -PRON- window tint but -PRON- leave with some brand new 22 rim and tire on -PRON- new 2017 dodge charger
-PRON- do not know the guy name who help -PRON- but -PRON- be great there
-PRON- will try -PRON- good to get -PRON- more customer
good maintenance shop -PRON- have ever deal with
-PRON- be honest work quickly reliable and have very reasonable price
over the past few year -PRON- have take 5 of -PRON- car to -PRON- and always be satisfied with the service -PRON- get
highly recommend
during -PRON- stay at cosmo -PRON- decide to try holstein 's shakes buns
-PRON- decide on the rise sun $ 18 kobe beef teriyaki glaze nori furikake crispy yam spicy mayo and tempura avocado
-PRON- also have a side of sweet potato fry
this burger blow -PRON- mind
-PRON- be crazy delicious
-PRON- really like the tempura avocado in -PRON- burger
bestie have the gold standard $ 18.50 dry aged beef sirloin burger with smoke bacon aged goat cheddar cheese tomato confit baby arugula and garlic chive aioli
this be just as good but -PRON- still think -PRON- burger win
awesome job
-PRON- use justin and shantell 's service for a couple of reason
the first be because -PRON- be a small family own business and justin do the work -PRON-
secondly -PRON- want a carpet clean company that do not use any chemical only natural organic product and thirdly because of all the positive review -PRON- receive on yelp
-PRON- would recommend -PRON- to all -PRON- family friend and acquaintance
justin be prompt thorough and even use bumper on the corner of -PRON- wall so as not to damage -PRON-
brilliant
have never have a carpet clean service that even consider protect -PRON-
plus -PRON- provide cloth bootie to wear while -PRON- be dry
-PRON- must say this be the best carpet clean experience -PRON- have ever have
-PRON- stop here with -PRON- mother for a weekday breakfast
-PRON- usually like the mom and pop greasy spoon but -PRON- be able to talk -PRON- into something different
holy toledo be -PRON- both glad -PRON- do
-PRON- get the pudd french toast and -PRON- have the corn beef hash
-PRON- have never ever enjoy corn beef hash in -PRON- life
now -PRON- do not want to eat anything but this corned beef hash
the corned beef be slice thin and place on top of potato latke fry crispy but still soft inside top with two perfectly cooked sunny side up egg
-PRON- french toast be delicious and have boozy syrup drizzle over top
grow up and decadent
coffee be excellent and local
decor be reminiscent of magnolia farm but chip and joanna would be proud
service be also excellent and clear that -PRON- be a personal venture
really enjoy this spot
please come and support the pant off this place
-PRON- need more smoke pork belly in -PRON- life
-PRON- have not stay at this hotel in over a decade since go on a family trip when the hotel be rather new and in -PRON- adult life now after -PRON- last short experience there -PRON- never would on -PRON- own
-PRON- go to the hotel to meet a client for dinner
-PRON- walk and see what look like -PRON- be the front desk
-PRON- be not
-PRON- ask the guy if -PRON- know where the restaurant in question be -PRON- say oh would -PRON- like pass to -PRON-
-PRON- can get -PRON- in just come over here and talk to -PRON- and that be when -PRON- realize -PRON- be one of those timeshare thing
so -PRON- say -PRON- only want to know where the restaurant be in the hotel because -PRON- be late for the meeting anyways
the lady behind the desk go let -PRON- see -PRON- credit card and id what
-PRON- know those folk be pushy but what give -PRON- the right to demand -PRON- to hand over -PRON- id and cc before -PRON- even explain to -PRON- what -PRON- be -PRON- be do
and why -PRON- need -PRON-
-PRON- be bad enough that -PRON- lie and say -PRON- would need pass to get into the restaurant but to ask for that be irresponsible and -PRON- be pathetic that a reputable hotel would give such shady business people space inside -PRON- hotel lobby
at that point -PRON- just walk away and decide to find the restaurant on -PRON- own
-PRON- be in the f&b business and let -PRON- start with the service
so bad
server not even nice
feel like mad every time -PRON- order something
no thank -PRON-
-PRON- would be polite and thank for every dish drop -PRON- would just get ignore
service may get through some of the negative of the quality of sushi but sushi chef seem not to care(u serve raw fish
so disappointed -PRON- spend -PRON- hard earn dollar here
attach picture of dirty dish on -PRON- table the whole meal
-PRON- never complain but -PRON- be just above and beyond a horrible
experience
-PRON- have meet owner and -PRON- feel bad staff be represent -PRON- in this way
if ther be any doubt -PRON- will attach picture of what -PRON- get serve here
dis color fish mushy urchin.and in this town of word of mouth -PRON- work in restaurant summerlin area
this
-PRON- will make sure no one ever waste a dollar in this place
like -PRON- say -PRON- have meet the owner and super nice people if u would like to email -PRON- about -PRON- experience pls do place be like a ghost town
now -PRON- know why
food be great
service be friendly and fast
drinks be perfect
the only reason -PRON- be give 4\/5 be because even though the food be really good -PRON- be just miss a tiny bit of something that would make -PRON- extraordinary
-PRON- have the $ 1 pei oysters- small but $ 1 the octopus appetizer the short rib the octopus ball and the eel risotto
all good but the risotto be a bit salty than necessary
-PRON- would definitely go back
come out with 40 people all bar industry people from santa barbara for a bachelor party
the w pool be epic
joe diggs be a legendary host
the hotel be also in the middle of all of the night life
would not stay anywhere else
i have not be here in year but -PRON- be the good ice cream i have ever have
even after all this time i can still taste -PRON-
i greatly miss -PRON- and hope someday to go back and have more
everything be homemade right down to the yummy waffle cone
i be a huge fan of anything chocolate but i must say -PRON- pumpkin pie flavor be amazing
if -PRON- be in pittsburgh make sure not to miss dave and andy 's
-PRON- favorite place on the strip
great food great price and great staff
especially billy robert and diego
thank guy
-PRON- like the bar counter next to the outside patio
always great service and get to hang out with local
d s
-PRON- have drive by this place hundred of time and always make a note to check -PRON- out sometime
-PRON- go in there today and be really impressed
what a cool place
very friendly and helpful
probably more than -PRON- need to eat
the dog be very good
fry even better
-PRON- have a lemon pepper aioli for the fry that be dynamite
a little pricy perhaps
$ 31 for 2 craft dog 2 beer and one fry
maybe not
maybe -PRON- be just cheap
-PRON- havn't be to vegas in 6 year or so
i want to stay on the strip during edc
have sum friend who get suite at the monte carlo
read some review and think -PRON- would be fine
overall i would rate -PRON- experience a 4 free self parking be a plus
also there be a tram for free that take -PRON- to the bellagio the pool be really cool
-PRON- have a lazy river
i rent an inner tube $ 10 each for a day
be careful
there be many ppl try to steal other 's inner tube
-PRON- only cost $ 10 people
all room in -PRON- opinion should have a mini fridge and microwave
i be tell -PRON- would cost $ 30 for a mini fridge
because i get a deluxe room and -PRON- have to downgrade -PRON- because i want a smoking room i be able to get the mini fridge comp
that be pretty cool
the view of the strip be o kay get room service for breakfast one morning
that be fun
i agree with some other people the shower head be ridiculous seem hard to get any water pressure out
the shower head look fancy but do not do anything
-PRON- only big complaint be that the pool close at 7 p.m.
this be vegas
why not midnight
other than that -PRON- be a nice hotel
-PRON- have enjoy every sandwich -PRON- have try at mister brisket
as far as sandwich spot in cleveland -PRON- would put -PRON- as a distant second to slyman 's
-PRON- be definitely worth a visit
a very old school feel with quality food
use to be good go there today and order 3 lamb souvlaki
-PRON- all come over cook -PRON- return 2 1 come back better the other come back over cook as well
the meat quality be really really bad -PRON- would get good meat at any other place
-PRON- believe -PRON- be not even lamb -PRON- look like beef with add lamb flavour
bad experience ever
go there after do some miniature golfing and get seat and the waitress promptly take -PRON- drink\/shake order
-PRON- come back awhile later and ask -PRON- what -PRON- want to eat all the while ask -PRON- again what -PRON- shake\/drink order be
-PRON- then bring out -PRON- shake order one every 5 minute but not in any rhyme or reason
-PRON- take to sniff every milk shake to see which one be which and still give -PRON- the wrong one
which be a little scary because -PRON- have someone allergic to banana and one of the friend have order a chocolate banana shake
one of the glass have food on the inside of -PRON- so -PRON- ask to have -PRON- remade but pretty sure -PRON- just dump the shake in a to go cup and add new whip cream on top
then come the order
fry come out before actual entree people be get the wrong burger
some do not even get -PRON- burger and -PRON- wait an hour
there be only two other table take
so there be hardly anyone there
-PRON- bring -PRON- order out and -PRON- have onion on -PRON- which -PRON- say -PRON- can not have and -PRON- send -PRON- back
-PRON- bring -PRON- back out and -PRON- be the exact same burger
all -PRON- do be take the onion off
seriously
-PRON- can not do a remake and make thing right
by that point -PRON- have have enough as -PRON- have send back three burger because -PRON- be wrong and two people still have not get -PRON- food
on top of that -PRON- be just a dumb staff and do not know what -PRON- be do
-PRON- wish that thing could have go better or that -PRON- could have like -PRON- food but after all of this -PRON- really doubt that -PRON- will even give johnny rocket a second glance
great mexican restaurant
-PRON- family and -PRON- have always use this place for special occasion
-PRON- show -PRON- how good a place be when -PRON- be slam full on a friday night in charlotte
both location can get full so that be a sign that -PRON- be do something right
-PRON- use -PRON- pogo pass to bowl consider -PRON- be spring break there be an 1.5 hr wait but -PRON- be kind enough to call -PRON- when -PRON- lane be ready
the kid have fun use bumper and the ramp for the littler one that could not throw\/roll the ball
the only down side be -PRON- want a pitcher of soda
and -PRON- do not do that -PRON- have to purchase individual drink start at $ 2 for a small
-PRON- have previously do the $ 5 movie on tuesdays -PRON- be reserved seating
which be great and the glow mini golf which be just so so

delicious
next -PRON- have the foie gra
love -PRON- so much -PRON- order -PRON- again
also have the gnocchi oso bucco ragout and the rabbit in mole
these be all appetizer and that be all -PRON- need
portion be decent
the rabbit be big of the plate -PRON- have
never get around to the entree
next trip
dessert be the brownie lollipop
again delicious
the flavor be all spot on
-PRON- like the eclectic choice and portion size
make for wonderful variety that -PRON- do not usually find on one menu
be an early monday evening the restaurant be quiet
-PRON- be worried service or quality may suffer but -PRON- do not
-PRON- server victoria be wonderful
angel the sommelier provide excellent information for -PRON- self make wine pairing
the hubert keller pino grigio -PRON- pair with -PRON- first course be delicious and a bargain
get a glass or two -PRON- will not be sorry
have -PRON- use delicious to many time
-PRON- will come back to fleur for sure
will likely order the grill octopus and foie gra again if still on the menu
like -PRON- other dish a lot too but need to leave room to explore the rest of the menu
have a party last night and come back home at 3:30
woke up early for a meetup event and get to get some energy booster
decide to get -PRON- matcha green tea latte with a chocolate browny
the browny taste amazingly good
although the waiter warn -PRON- the latte would not be too sweet if -PRON- take regular sweetness -PRON- still think -PRON- be good enough because of the browny
this facility be locate right next to a hospital so if -PRON- experience trouble with walking then have someone drop -PRON- off at the front because of the lack of available parking
phoenix orthopedic consultants be locate in suite 120
-PRON- seem to take back like a round of three patient at a time and distribute -PRON- to a variety of exam room -PRON- do not know if this be common practice
then dr. tipirneni quickly visit each patient for a few minute before the next round of patient be bring back
-PRON- visit with -PRON- for a few minute then off to the next one
-PRON- seem like the nurse\/medical assistant be do all of the work run here and there with so much on -PRON- plate
-PRON- hate go to the doctor and mostly -PRON- be because of all of the wait time even when -PRON- be early or on time for -PRON- schedule appt
this place be a perfect example of make -PRON- wait past -PRON- schedule appointment time
wait at the front wait in the back wait some more after the doctor see -PRON-
so much waiting
-PRON- total appointment time turn into a few hour
-PRON- even notice -PRON- take back another patient who be extra early for -PRON- appointment
-PRON- appt be after -PRON- but -PRON- get in before -PRON-
-PRON- do not know if -PRON- experience will make any impact with anyone decide to visit this place
-PRON- wish there be more review about medical doctor and dentist like there be plentiful review about restaurant to eat at
-PRON- have never write a review before
but -PRON- be so impressed with these guy
from the moment -PRON- call -PRON- event become as important to -PRON- as -PRON- be to -PRON-
-PRON- have quite a few people go on this event
so -PRON- suggest use one of -PRON- party bus
-PRON- have never use a party bus before
so -PRON- be unsure
but when -PRON- show -PRON- the inside -PRON- be blow away
-PRON- be perfect the driver be excellent and the itinerary be follow to a t. go forward -PRON- will always use az limo
-PRON- have be eat here or get pizza deliver since -PRON- open this joint
-PRON- be really good at first and have slowly go down hill
maybe -PRON- be own by somebody different than the tasty scottdale location
go keep this short and simple
the quality of the food and service at this location be always consistently hit or miss
sometime -PRON- be great and other time -PRON- be awful
the last few pizza that be deliver to the house have black burn cornmeal cover the entire bottom of the crust
this be simply an oven that be not be maintain properly and most unfortunate
since this be not about try to graduate with a 2.0 or good and -PRON- be not go out of -PRON- way to apply the bell shape curve to -PRON- past dining experience
big meh
2.25 stars
the place be pretty small and understaffed
-PRON- friend finish dish come first
-PRON- yang zhou fry rice come when -PRON- friend finish -PRON- lunch
the yang zhou fry rice be pretty salty
some part of the rice be extremely salty
the rice be not mixed in well
pretty disappointed at the experience
-PRON- offer an awesome menu with good breakfast and just like the name giant hamburger that be delicious
love come here
dinner buffet be very limited
what -PRON- do have be good but who ever hear of a dinner buffer without fry chicken or bake potato
salad bar be weak
breakfast buffet be much good with french toast 3 type of scramble egg 3 type of sausage pancake waffle
breakfast
yes
dinner
no
this place be great
just like ny
thank goodness that -PRON- find this pizzeria
-PRON- pizza pie be thin and delicious
-PRON- buffalo and ziti pizza be great and fill
-PRON- sandwich and salad be great
if -PRON- be look for great tasting food and an actual ny style pizzeria -PRON- have find -PRON-
-PRON- be like a piece of new york in las vegas
and -PRON- be love the ordering online availability
first time here
three thing worth note
music be a bit loud so -PRON- can not really enjoy a movie with earphone
sunshine be very strong in afternoon as the window face west
the bike parking rack around the place be the sort of lock -PRON- wheel rather than the frame and -PRON- be not even wide enough to fit a mountain bike 's wheel
good chinese food in charlotte
spring roll be the good -PRON- have shrimp in -PRON-
beef and broccoli -PRON- go too
sesame chicken general to amazing
-PRON- be the closet to nyc
-PRON- sushi do not smell or taste good
-PRON- be so confused -PRON- -PRON- rating be so high
-PRON- roll be sketchy and -PRON- be not go to go back when there be so many adequate sushi restaurant in the area
-PRON- husband and -PRON- go to gilley 's for lunch on a sunday
thing start out ok
-PRON- be seat quickly and the atmosphere be nice and relaxing
-PRON- waitress come over right after -PRON- be seat
-PRON- get the chipotle chicken sandwich and -PRON- hubby get the cowboy burger
both come with a generous helping of fry and be really tasty
problem be after -PRON- get -PRON- food and drink the waitress make -PRON- scarce
-PRON- be not that big of a deal though
-PRON- would probably come back again
really special place very fun and hip vibe
downstairs on the main level be no reservation family style seating sort of like long picnic table
the bench be not comfy at all so if that be an issue good make a reservation and eat upstairs in the serene dining room
a great option and -PRON- favorite way to go be to sit at the open expo bar which be open to the kitchen
the tat up staff could not be friendly and watch -PRON- work be like watch art be create
the menu be adventurous so keep an open mind
-PRON- steak be fantastic for those not up for an adventure and a treat for those look for something special
the seafood dish be always terrific as be -PRON- foul and vegetarian option
-PRON- have to strongly encourage -PRON- get the soup
any soup -PRON- have
-PRON- be not even a soup lover but -PRON- be always something special
-PRON- also suggest -PRON- try one of -PRON- signature drink
-PRON- usually involve muddle botanical and really make -PRON- feel like -PRON- be in some exotic locale as oppose to the not yet gentrifi larwrenceville neighborhood of pittsburgh
there be real artistry happen here that -PRON- feel may be underappreciat in pit
bachi burger thank for be vegetarian friendly
-PRON- really enjoy -PRON- meal here last night with friend
-PRON- have two menu available for -PRON- to choose from bachi burger and shoku ramen
-PRON- be assume that the shoku ramen place next door share the same owner as bachi burger which be why -PRON- have two different menu
atmosphere
darken light create an intimate atmosphere for friend and couple
wood panel wall and skylight make the space feel lay back and upscale
-PRON- be definitely comfortable
-PRON- be busy and the table be space far apart from each other so that -PRON- have lot of space to have private conversation and can talk loudly without bother other
food
alcohol japanese appetizer ramen offer from next door 's kitchen and asian fusion fry and burger be on the menu
-PRON- have a great selection and there be many choice of burger for all type of appetite

-PRON- be miss a bit of a wow factor though
but point for have vegetarian choice
service
very understanding and patient server
-PRON- friend be one of those people that ask -PRON- lot of question and take awhile to order
-PRON- guy server with curly hair -PRON- think be patient and explain everything perfectly
-PRON- even bring -PRON- -PRON- somewhat difficult water order as -PRON- all want -PRON- hot iced and room temperature
-PRON- know the customer -PRON- all dislike

also more tip for -PRON- sir
overall good night
a little pricey for burger but -PRON- be well execute and delicious so no complaint here
will be back
unique place with a staff who be under school in -PRON- product
while -PRON- enjoy the cheese fondue the bread and dipper be lack ingenuity or freshness
way over price for what -PRON- give
stay home and bring back the 80 's fondue at home be more enjoyable
wish -PRON- have good thing to say
be shop
frys for year the wait
the pharmacy sucks
thought since the up grade
the wait would go down
-PRON- be totally wrong
and do not get -PRON- start on the rude deli people
-PRON- look at -PRON- like what be -PRON- do here
everything that be not good for -PRON-
but -PRON- be soooo good
the salad be not good here
if -PRON- go there to eat all of -PRON- fry food item be scrumptious worthy of one good cheat meal
trust -PRON- -PRON- will make -PRON- get a room of -PRON- be from out of town
-PRON- be that good
nothing be restock
bland and unseasond
-PRON- use to love come to this location
but -PRON- will continue to go out of -PRON- way to the flamingo location
-PRON- guy be slip
when this angel and -PRON- hip family member who be in the vegas know want sinfully fresh sushi this be where -PRON- go

late friday and saturday night try the bar -PRON- be a good locale for -PRON- and -PRON- crew to hold court and court trouble

before -PRON- get -PRON- moniker the runaway groom and -PRON- start -PRON- night of vegas flash with some substantive and incredibly satisfy fare
-PRON- could not get enough of the excellent roll fresh sashimi great donburi and nice udon noodle
check out the daily special because -PRON- be usually really good

-PRON- have never be disappoint with the food nor the service
the runaway groom however be another matter
-PRON- turn out to be a stale puffer unlike the fresh tasty and exotic fish feature this place

overall runaway from the strip do not walk to this place for excellent sushi great service and interesting character
overall good if -PRON- have low expectation
-PRON- need a renovation and menu focus
food 3 star
there be a large selection which be good for variety but nothing really stand out
the burger be good but not great
-PRON- order on a sunday and -PRON- be out of romaine lettuce which seem avoidable
french onion soup be very good
price 3 star
a burger range from $ 9-$11 which be not cheap
sandwiches be $ 11 which be not cheap
service
-PRON- order carry out so -PRON- can not rate -PRON-
appearance 3 star
the interior be in a very bad need of a renovation
-PRON- be cramp and dark and have junk on the wall
-PRON- need to tear out the interior wall to give -PRON- more of an open feeling
the outdoor patio be very nice
basically -PRON- can not decide if -PRON- be a dive bar or upscale bar
decide to spend a last minute day trip at disneyland and want to rent a car
come across sixt and -PRON- offer of luxury car such as a merc cla250 for under $ 40 per day though -PRON- be fully expect a bait and switch model upgrade
book online through a 3rd party site fill in the requisite info and a few hour later be drive off in a beautiful white rental
the process be easy the pick up fairly simple and the staff well the two young lady -PRON- deal with anyway courteous
do be sure to pull into the gas station and look the car over before leave to update the walk around info
the car be pretty clean save some detail issue with the glass and dash
the return process be pretty simple as well
no complaint
every time -PRON- have out of town guest this be the phoenix mexican place -PRON- take -PRON- to
quaint and homey atmosphere think dot abuela 's formal dining room adorable service mind blow flavor not tex mex and painstakingly cure meat those magician in the kitchen be fifth generation butcher from mexico city -PRON- guy

if -PRON- be look for a deva cut this be not the place -PRON- do cut curl by curl but -PRON- stretch -PRON- curl when -PRON- cut -PRON- and
any curly girl know that disturb the curl pattern and be not an actual representation
i give -PRON- 3 star because -PRON- be a nice look shop very clean and friendly staff but the curl cutting process be very off and different from what i ever have before when i get a curly cut
danielle cut -PRON- hair once -PRON- start cut i start to cringe a little because of how much -PRON- be cut off unnecessarily
the plus side of cut so much hair off
-PRON- guess be a fresh start and have 100 healthy hair
but i think the cut be drastic and unnecessary and length could have be preserve if -PRON- do not pull on the curl so much and stretch -PRON- out
this place have lovely interior decor
pho 1 house special beef tripe beef ball tendon noodle not as thin as -PRON- would like -PRON- but have a good texture and be not overcook broth very clear little fat flavourful and most importantly do not have those disgusting soapy bubble that a lot of those other pho place have meat
beef be a little gamey but tendon and tripe be plentiful
-PRON- have never see 6 cube of tendon in a bowl before
rice wrap shrimp taste fresh
shrimp be great
have slight minty flavour the sauce be garlicky and sweet
-PRON- love this place
the chicken pita be seriously amazing
hummus be the good -PRON- have have
-PRON- only suggestion be for -PRON- to use a more flavorful tomato that the watery cheap roma
maybe grape or hothouse
-PRON- would make a huge difference
sandwich yes
outstanding yes
minitalia deli be just a shell of -PRON- former incarnation as an italian grocery store
most everything be go except the deli some fresh bread and a few other item
however -PRON- can not say loud enough
minitalia deli be an outstanding sandwich and italian deli shop
do not look for anything else and -PRON- will not be disappoint
-PRON- have a good ten or fifteen predesigned sandwich combination with various interesting name
try the manhattan and the park avenue which be two of -PRON- favorite
during the weekday -PRON- serve hot sandwich also such as meatball hoagies and hot sausages also some soup and chili
if -PRON- get there right around lunch time -PRON- can expect a bit of a line to get -PRON- deli meat or sandwich make
also inside -PRON- have some seating if -PRON- want to eat there
many local workman stop in for -PRON- lunch here
the service be pretty good with nothing fancy just what would -PRON- like and
okay
-PRON- will make -PRON- for -PRON- right away kind of attention
-PRON- will not be disappoint in the made to order sandwich either
single or double meat any kind of bread cheese etc
-PRON- customize -PRON- own sandwich here pretty often
-PRON- get -PRON- with lettuce tomato and red pepper as a favorite
the meat mostly boar head and the cheese be very very fresh
nothing sit around here very long without be devour
do -PRON- say that -PRON- pile the meat high very high so -PRON- have a fun challenge get -PRON- mouth around -PRON-
cash sure
credit card yes with a modern twist
-PRON- receipt will come via text message or email -PRON- choice
really be kind of neat for a deli
get hungry for lunch have a great sandwich turner 's ice tea and some chip
oh boy tasty
this place be a waste of money
-PRON- bed be horrible and the manager liz marsh be at good an uneducated low brow
-PRON- will not continue that but more on -PRON- at the conclusion of the review
stay tune
the price be elevated but in talk to the first person that wait on -PRON- -PRON- be offer bonus buck and be tell -PRON- could use -PRON- toward lotion or upgrade to other bed
after go in the only stand up bed -PRON- have and use the bonus buck twice towards the lotion
-PRON- be get no tan and have a base tan already
another thing -PRON- be tell be that -PRON- could cancel at anytime as long as -PRON- give 30 day notice
at first visit -PRON- be tell to sign an electronic pad and be provide no print out at that time
grant -PRON- be on -PRON- lunch hour and rushing
-PRON- could have print -PRON- out while -PRON- be ummmm tanning
that do not happen however
when -PRON- be not get a tan -PRON- decide to cancel
-PRON- go in and be tell -PRON- have to write a letter to the owner to notify -PRON- -PRON- want to cancel
the strange thing -PRON- have ever hear a business do and this be of course the last day -PRON- have before give notice in time to cancel for the next month how convenient for -PRON- -PRON- be get more of -PRON- money
and then again conveniently -PRON- hand -PRON- a print out of the bs policy supersede the pay customer stand in -PRON- location in person
at this point -PRON- be irritated but figure -PRON- will use up the rest of the bonus buck on the good bed
-PRON- prefer stand up but -PRON- be awful
two time at least -PRON- do this and use the bonus buck towards the lotion
today -PRON- go in to do the same and finish out the package -PRON- have purchase already from this place
-PRON- be tell -PRON- can not use the bonus buck towards the lotion and
the desk person call the manager liz marsh to get approval because -PRON- complain -PRON- have already do -PRON- twice before
-PRON- can hear the manager yell at the girl on the phone
-PRON- decide to ask to speak to the manager
hi -PRON- be use the rest of -PRON- package up -PRON- be not a frequent tanner and have already use the bonus buck twice towards the lotion and just want to finish up the rest of -PRON- package -PRON- be ask -PRON- to make an exception
-PRON- barely finish -PRON- request and liz marsh begin to scream be -PRON- crazy
that be -PRON- give -PRON- something for free
no way -PRON- cancel -PRON- account let -PRON- interject -PRON- be pay until end of august and expect -PRON- to let -PRON- use -PRON- bonus buck
basically at this point -PRON- stop hear -PRON- because yes -PRON- be tell -PRON- off about -PRON- misinformed employee or plain misrepresentation of -PRON- stupid sale and even stupider policy
oh and scream at a customer that pay
get -PRON- shit together sunsational
this be in no way an elevated or unwarranted review
-PRON- yell at a customer

3.5 star food literally be hit or miss but even the miss be still edible
-PRON- have get food to go from here twice now
so -PRON- be review base on that
fast service and -PRON- include everything thing -PRON- need and more in -PRON- take out from duck sauce aka sweet n sour sauce to soy sauce
spring roll be pretty standard
-PRON- always get the egg drop soup so addict and serve pip hot
come with fry wonton which -PRON- like
the chicken lo mein be surprisingly tasty and addict for something so simple
orange chicken seem to have so much bread and the flavor of the sauce be of course different from -PRON- conventional panda express
mongolian beef again have decent flavor but the problem for -PRON- be in the texture of the meat as in -PRON- be chewy and some piece be tough or have gristle
-PRON- do not recommend get any entree with just shrimp because although the shrimp be big -PRON- do not compensate for the quantity -PRON- give -PRON-
-PRON- will find -PRON- notice how much vegetable be on the plate instead
nonetheless the shrimp with spicy garlic sauce be pack with flavor and not too spicy
but -PRON- would definitely get -PRON- with a different protein
lunch special be worth the price and can be fill plus -PRON- be till 4 p.m.
-PRON- order the family dinner a today and for two people -PRON- be an overwhelming amount of food but great for the price and -PRON- get choice
-PRON- would say -PRON- can feed three maybe four people
-PRON- give -PRON- the big size soup too
miss -PRON- seoul trip and have to get -PRON- korean fry chicken fix -PRON- fry chicken be huge crispy and not greasy at all
-PRON- like the soy garlic sauce
pretty tasty but -PRON- only stay on the outside not the meat
-PRON- would suggest the chicken to be marinate before -PRON- get fry
-PRON- wish -PRON- give beer that -PRON- can enjoy with the fry chicken
oh well -PRON- be vegas not hongdae
-PRON- can not complain
overall -PRON- statisif -PRON- crave of korean fry chicken suggestion more variety of the sauce and spicy level
beer
marinate juicy chicken
be -PRON- ask too much
but that be what a true foodie ultimate mission search and taste all the good food in the world haha
this will be on -PRON- come back list ~~
-PRON- be look forward to more delicious fry chicken
serivce be very attentive good job
this be a place that be always pack so reservation be an absolute must
for an appetizer one of the folk in -PRON- party of 10 order garlic bread with goat cheese and a red sauce
omg
-PRON- be fantastic
-PRON- would have that with every meal if -PRON- could pull off the massive garlic aftershock
for dinner -PRON- order the steak roquefort
the steak have incredible flavor and be enormous but be a bit gristly so that be a disappointment
the pomme frit be spectacular
but -PRON- be already full from the carb load of bread
so -PRON- be not able to make a dent in -PRON-
-PRON- do not see the total bill but the place be worth a visit
-PRON- have be through this airport
least 100 time now
-PRON- seem to learn a little more every time -PRON- go through
today when -PRON- land -PRON- be bright and sunny outside
but then look out the window there be snow every where
this airport be huge and -PRON- can get a flight just about any where from here
-PRON- have free wi fi for starter which be always good
-PRON- be a really beautiful airport and the smell of southern bbq be all through out
shuttle and nice not over whelm
except when -PRON- go to the international side -PRON- seem sterile and clean then as -PRON- keep go towards the gate -PRON- get dark like -PRON- dim the light
there be a lot of really good food choice at this airport as well as some good shopping
-PRON- be set in a nice wooded area of nc
as -PRON- write this -PRON- sit on a lovely white wood rocker
that be part of an art exhibit at one time
now -PRON- be scatter through out for a lovely rest

-PRON- husband and -PRON- both recall see somewhere that -PRON- be heated and -PRON- most definitely be not
that be kind of annoying as -PRON- have very much be look forward to swimming
and at only 3 foot deep -PRON- be not optimal for swimming anyway lot and lot of option for food and drink
lot of entertainment
-PRON- personal favorite be the titanic museum
and gift shop
a really neat experience with so many artifact from the ship model first and third class room and a room that be the same temperature as the evening
the titanic strike the ice burg to give a sense of the condition
really really neat
the gift shop be also interesting with lot of odd and end
the staff of the hotel seem friendly from -PRON- few interaction with -PRON-
the luxor be at the end of the strip so -PRON- be relatively easy to get from place to place
if -PRON- go back -PRON- would definitely consider stay at luxor again though -PRON- would love to see some of the other hotel as there be so many hotel that look awesome
four star because 1 -PRON- do not really have anything to compare -PRON- to and -PRON- have no major complaint except for point number 2
2
-PRON- forget what -PRON- be call
but there be some sort of hotel fee add on to each evening that -PRON- stay
this be completely ludicrous as -PRON- do not even tell -PRON- what -PRON- be for
-PRON- be very clearly just a money grab something the hotel do because -PRON- can much like a surcharge when -PRON- buy ticket for an event online
and there be a surcharge even though a computer do all of the work
and -PRON- print the ticket out -PRON-
-PRON- be ridiculous
personally -PRON- would much rather the hotel charge an extra x amount of dollar per night -PRON- forget what the fee actually be rather than charge -PRON- guest an additional fee for seemingly nothing
the principal reason for the 2 star be the awful service -PRON- receive while din there recently
-PRON- have a reservation for a party of 8 and one person 's dish do not arrive until after the rest of -PRON- have receive and eat -PRON- food
all the while -PRON- server generally ignore -PRON- unless -PRON- flag -PRON- down to find out what be go on
-PRON- just make up excuse about how the seafood take a long time to prepare
clearly that be not true and -PRON- would have be much good have -PRON- just fess up and explain that someone drop the ball apologize and drop that dish from -PRON- check
no such luck
when -PRON- ask -PRON- to remove the dish from the check -PRON- respond with well -PRON- eat -PRON- do not -PRON- and would not let -PRON- speak with a manager
in the end -PRON- give -PRON- a gift certificate for the dish only say -PRON- could not go back remove the charge
again not true
as someone who have work as a server in several restaurant -PRON- all know that anticipatory guidance go a long way
and -PRON- be the least -PRON- can do for a happy customer
this server totally miss the mark
for that reason -PRON- be not sure -PRON- will return
other server appear to be more helpful be more apologetic about -PRON- issue so maybe -PRON- be just this one person
but in general i agree with recommendation to avoid large party here
-PRON- clearly do not know how to handle -PRON- despite have a reservation
there be other issue as well not a smooth experience at all
the japanese food be unimpressive udon noodle be awful
but the malaysian food be delicious
if -PRON- go back -PRON- will stick to the malaysian side of the menu
this place be so bad
-PRON- do not know what everyone on here be rave about
to start the service be so bad -PRON- server not only forget to put -PRON- order in but be not refill -PRON- water nor take away any used dish from -PRON- table
have -PRON- be busy -PRON- may have be understandable but there be only 3 table in the entire restaurant
the sushi here be so bland -PRON- taste like -PRON- be can fish -PRON- wrap in rice
the roll be also fall apart and very mushy
also get the tempura udon soup -PRON- literally taste like soy sauce the water down and boil and add noodle and seaweed
if -PRON- want at least semi decent food do not bother even go here -PRON- crap
sorry
but -PRON- do not know why anyone would pay to eat this food
first time at this location or any other
food be really good although for the price -PRON- think the meat portion should be a bit large
-PRON- have the pull pork and try all -PRON- sauce
the brush fire sauce be really good
definitely will be back
this be absolutely the best pizza in arizona hand down
the slice be such a great deal and so tasty
-PRON- personally love to get a slice of pepperoni mushroom jalepeno and pineapple
the owner otto be so sweet and adorable
all the worker be extremely friendly and outgoing and make -PRON- feel at home
-PRON- would reccomend this place to everyone and anyone
the delivery be free and the driver be super rad ottos be the best pizza
place in the world
so excited that -PRON- bring this place to old town scottsdale
-PRON- food be amazing especially the fish taco
-PRON- just wish -PRON- be more patio space
delivery order four time now and while -PRON- be not earth shattering americanize chinese food
-PRON- be be well pack hot and on time
yes some of the sauce specially the kung pao be bland but the hot and sour soup thankfully doesn't fall into that group
really a 2.5 raise to a 3
just have lunch with some friend
the fry chicken and waffle be very good
but the good part be the service
-PRON- have the winterlicious lunch deal which include a 15 gratuity and tax
-PRON- friend mistakenly add an additional tip while pay the bill
when -PRON- waiter be inform -PRON- actually return the amount
-PRON- think that be extra nice of -PRON- and totally make -PRON- lunch experience that extra bit special
the drink be cold the food be hot and the service be good
that be the good way to describe this place -PRON- have a good time here
the drink be very cold especially when -PRON- be hot outside
the food be tasty and sever in a very fast manner
-PRON- waitress be friendly and helpful with the menu and when -PRON- ask a question -PRON- be very knowledgeable
if -PRON- be down on fremont st this be a good place to grab something to drink and eat
decent giant eagle to cover the necessity
-PRON- would drive out of the way but do not mind shop here if in the area
jason do a great job on -PRON- wife 's upper arm tattoo
-PRON- turn out nicer than -PRON- be expect
jason do -PRON- medical alert also which turn out great
-PRON- highly recommend jason frieling
-PRON- can not say enough about dr blotnick and the staff at randolph road
dr blotnick be a fantastic surgeon and -PRON- believe -PRON- get the iol implant when -PRON- do -PRON- cataract surgery in 2012
that take -PRON- from 20\/400 to 20\/20 within a few day as -PRON- heal
not only be -PRON- a great surgeon
but -PRON- also be a very friendly guy who be truly interested in -PRON- as a person

great view of the bellagio fountain
oh and can not forget about the decadent bread pudding
amazing
-PRON- come here recently to try the french toast and -PRON- be not bad
-PRON- would say the food here be no difference from any other breakfast restaurant
sure -PRON- have taste better but weird enough if -PRON- be look for breakfast in the morning the first place -PRON- would think of would be sunset grill but -PRON- would probably try a different location
the store -PRON- in here be very small compare to other one -PRON- have see
-PRON- do not get as much business and do not look as professional as the other
but this one do have a back patio which a few do not
nothing really special just ordinary breakfast
overall -PRON- give this location of sunset grill 2 star simply because though the food be alright and -PRON- should have be a 3 star
the environment and the inside have bring the rating down to a 2
-PRON- be walk from mgm to aria and cosmopolitan and make pit stop at every place that have alcohol along the way and make new friend at every stop

yum everyone in -PRON- group be totally trash and surprisingly -PRON- be not
-PRON- figure out which new find friend buy -PRON- drink as -PRON- see -PRON- faceplant while -PRON- be on the walkway from city center to mgm and metro be mean mug -PRON- instead of help -PRON- get up
shame

the ivy league be worth a visit
over forty year ago as a little girl -PRON- family would eat here
through the year -PRON- would come here when in the area
always good memory
-PRON- be thankful that -PRON- get to eat here once with -PRON- own grandkid just as -PRON- do when -PRON- be little
first of all this place never have the same price for the item and the lady who work there be very rude
-PRON- order a combo come with 3 item well the rice -PRON- give -PRON- be old and
-PRON- be cheap give -PRON- 1 egg 2 shrimp 1 piece of pork and 1 meatball

this place rob -PRON- money
beware do not go here bad customer service

-PRON- attention to detail be outstanding and -PRON- always leave the salon feel great
-PRON- be blonde and very particular about -PRON- color

the food be average not bad but not great and the service be lackluster
-PRON- be a great room though
-PRON- likely will get volume because of -PRON- location in the encore\/wynn but -PRON- have a way to go before -PRON- hit the big time
do not use this walgreens for western union
-PRON- send -PRON- grandson $ 400 via western union and this store will only give out $ 300 maximum
first -PRON- want to say this place be awesome
-PRON- be from out of town and -PRON- manage to break -PRON- phone while here on a business trip

-PRON- come into the shop one hour and a half before close time as soon as -PRON- walk in -PRON- be greet by the customer service rep a plus
-PRON- tell the customer service rep -PRON- problem
and -PRON- immediately give -PRON- phone to the service tech who then assure -PRON- -PRON- would do everything within -PRON- power to get -PRON- phone fix by close time
-PRON- be flabbergast even though -PRON- give the service tech such a short time frame
-PRON- be still able to assure -PRON- that -PRON- phone would be fix today
to say that -PRON- be happy be an understatement
-PRON- be beyond relieved and grateful for -PRON- attentiveness and speedy service
the service tech manage to further impress -PRON- when -PRON- phone be fix within one hour of drop -PRON- off versus the hour and a half -PRON- have originally commit to

also -PRON- be get renovate
new name
woochi buffet
-PRON- be guess that -PRON- will open sometime in the next several week
hopefully -PRON- will continue to have good food at a good price but also be a clean and more focused on treat -PRON- customer well
come here with -PRON- friend after an event and still kind of hungry
locate in the center of the commercial center area next to the tokyo japanese restaurant
apparently this place be super popular in az and since -PRON- open in vegas -PRON- decide to try -PRON-
the interior decor be like a normal bar dark with the bar in the middle table surround except with an open style kitchen
the seat be the unusual thing
-PRON- like form to -PRON- butt
well at least -PRON- anyway
apparently -PRON- be uncomfortable for -PRON- friend small xd
since -PRON- be not really hungry and the waiter say each of these pasty be dense and weigh like a pound each -PRON- opt to get 1 and share
then dessert afterwards as per recommendation on yelp xd
since this be -PRON- first time -PRON- order the oggie which be -PRON- traditional pasty which have steak potato onion and rutabaga type of turnip with a side of red wine gravy
when the pasty come -PRON- be already split in half on two plate + 1
-PRON- try pick up -PRON- half indeed -PRON- be heavy and pretty dense
but the pastry crust look sooooo good
the inside be fill with the ingredient i have list before
there be a lot of potato and not that much steak in -PRON- half
the red wine gravy be nice a little sour like -PRON- would expect from a sauce reduction make with red wine
the crust be super good and flaky
not too buttery
for -PRON- i would have prefer the filling to be a little more seasoned
seem a little plain for -PRON- even drench -PRON- in the red wine gravy
as for dessert -PRON- have get the banoffee sub the banana for strawberry -PRON- friend do not like banana
-PRON- a very simple dessert make with a sugarless heavy whip cream cut fruit a crush graham cracker crust on the bottom and a homemade caramel
not be a fan of caramel but this be actually surprisingly good
since -PRON- a different type of caramel -PRON- be not sticky like sticky to the tooth or roof of -PRON- mouth
take -PRON- head quite a while to wrap around the concept simplicity and different but good
-PRON- friend thoroughly enjoy -PRON- after slightly struggle to finish -PRON- half of the pasty
for those who want to try something different i recommend try this
quite inexpensive too
$ 5
good to share with
overall not bad
-PRON- would like to come back and try -PRON- other pasty
something with a strong flavor like banger or spicy asiago chicken or the reuben
stomach rumble while finish this
dang if only -PRON- be not so far
xd
wow -PRON- have be here a total of 2 time and both time -PRON- have confirm one thing
this really be not somewhere
-PRON- want to be
very young crowd normally in here
and -PRON- have equate bull in bar to be something that just do not sit well with seek a more mature crowd
but -PRON- highly doubt the owner of bar really care because the place do get pack and the youngin 's there seem to really love the place
the music -PRON- play seem to be a good mix -PRON- go through a cycle of typical club hit and some 70 's throwback
-PRON- have hear good thing about blue ribbon fried chicken for a long time but now -PRON- finally get around to try -PRON- and those good thing be all true
-PRON- be a fast casual restaurant and the service be very quick
rather than have traditional coke or pepsi fountain drink -PRON- offer the boylan fountain drink which be hard to find and good than most of the coke or pepsi product
the cream soda be -PRON- favorite
-PRON- order the cheesy supreme which come with american cheese swiss cheese chicken lettuce tomato and pickle and the blue ribbon special sauce
the bun be fresh and crispy and the sandwich be perfection
the blue ribbon special sauce and -PRON- ranch have a little bit of a pickle taste to -PRON- which be not great but -PRON- compliment the sandwich well
-PRON- come with a side of thin crispy fry and coleslaw but -PRON- substitute the cole slaw with extra fry
overall the restaurant have great service be clean and have amazing food
-PRON- will definitely be back

-PRON- taste pretty good to -PRON- but -PRON- wish -PRON- order something with tapioca instead

one thing -PRON- love about -PRON- pedicure be that -PRON- massage -PRON- entire calf not just -PRON- foot

-PRON- read on another article on how great this place be and how other customer obviously enjoy this place http:\/\/localvegasdeals.com\/coffee tea house\/boba
tastic\/.
-PRON- be definitely a place to go
everything be right and -PRON- be friendly
-PRON- would go back
love -PRON- cherry limeaide
-PRON- use a groupon to eat at hussongs
and the service be great
but the food be not
the chip be really bad
and the food taste like something out of a box
if -PRON- be not familiar with mexican food -PRON- will probably be fine eat here but if -PRON- like good mexican food this be not -PRON- place
feast of the god -PRON- a$$
wait in line for an hour and a half only to get inside and have to wait wait wait at each food line for food that be just ok
the same go for the dessert
the ice cream taste like ice milk the strawberry be not ripe the tiramisu be nothing to write home about
not one thing amazingly delicious or decadent nothing unique nothing knock -PRON- sock off -PRON- have to go back for more of that good
the presentation be nice but the flavor lack a punch
the service be good waiter and waitress be very polite -PRON- beverage glass stay full one waiter even stand watch over -PRON- plate as -PRON- go back to try some other food
when u walk in -PRON- take -PRON- group 's picture then later on try to sell -PRON- to -PRON- for $ 35
$ 35
after the wait -PRON- have and the $ 50 -PRON- pay to eat this food that be just one step above golden corral -PRON- should have give everyone that damn pic for free
the buffet at the bellagio be much good
at the end of -PRON- baccha not experience -PRON- conclude that -PRON- should have just go to -PRON- old fav the bellagio
this place be a nightmare
-PRON- stop here a few week back
and -PRON- have be die to leave -PRON- thought here for other yelp user so -PRON- know to avoid this place at all cost
for starter -PRON- see an extremely loud blatantly drunk individual the minute -PRON- walk in
-PRON- later find out this be owner of this bar
-PRON- can not believe that an owner would be this belligerent in -PRON- own bar
next the bartender be only take drink order from the owner and regular
after awhile -PRON- watch the regular even walk out because all -PRON- be do be talk to the owner
the owner go back to the kitchen at one point could barely walk and start scream at the top of -PRON- lung at the cook
-PRON- order food even after that figure -PRON- would be decent since -PRON- be just scold lol -PRON- be dead wrong
chicken parmesan taste like -PRON- be in a freezer for 6 month
the wing be cold no surprise after wait for 45 minute with about 10 people in the bar none of -PRON- eat by the way
the fry be terrible and the celery be literally rotten and brown
after another hour -PRON- decide to try another bar because this place be awful
-PRON- see in another post about a police officer in the parking lot -PRON- experience the same
there be a uniform officer mark back window to pull over later
-PRON- be here a few time in the past and with what start out as maybe a three star bar at good have drastically decrease in quality
each time bad than the last
-PRON- will never go here again and -PRON- hope the drunk owner read this and realize -PRON- action lose a multi million dollar earner as a customer
one who enjoy keep money in the local community
-PRON- will be spend -PRON- money everywhere else in plum
never here
the last couple of time -PRON- have go to las vegas -PRON- have make -PRON- a point to head here and get the buffalo wings
this be one of -PRON- favorite spot to go for wing period
and -PRON- always look forward to gorge on the delicious hunk of spicy chicken flesh
sadly the wing -PRON- love so much be now completely different
-PRON- be more like panda express orange chicken than buffalo wings
so if -PRON- be into the whole non traditional wing recipe go for -PRON-
-PRON- be not a fan
this time around -PRON- have a few buck with -PRON- and decide to try to rio dry aged rib eye
awesome
one of the good steak -PRON- have ever have
somewhat pricey but 35 buck for a dry aged 20 oz
steak be not really that bad
all in all decent spot
usually -PRON- go to various place to get -PRON- oil change and regular maintenance but after visit this midas location and deal with lisa -PRON- think -PRON- have find -PRON- spot
-PRON- be awesome
speechless
grimaldi 's leave -PRON- speechless
since -PRON- leave nyc find great pizza have be a challenge and a mission for -PRON-
-PRON- have -PRON- short list of favorite in la
but -PRON- hear about grimaldi 's and take advantage of the opportunity when -PRON- be in las vegas
this be stunningly good pizza that would stand with the good in nyc
what confound -PRON- be that grimaldi 's be a chain base on the brooklyn original
until now great pizza border on artistry
somehow grimaidi 's figure out how to break down the process result in the execution of consistently amazing pie
wow
-PRON- have coal oven access to hard to find ingredient like bufalo mozzarella and -PRON- do not look at -PRON- strangely when -PRON- ask for a margherita pie a real pizzeria
-PRON- love the thought of grimaldi 's expand to city where decent pizza can not be find and where low rent chain like domino 's be put out of business
holy hell this be a wonderful establishment of everything meaty and delicious
-PRON- use to go to this location on the reg and drown -PRON- sorrow in some hamburger especially after final week
-PRON- wish -PRON- keep track of how often -PRON- go here
but -PRON- can say with confidence that -PRON- business alone be probably enough to keep this company afloat
-PRON- favorite be the galley boy
but -PRON- would typically just go an buy some plain jane triple to down because -PRON- be a fatass
amazing
close to home which deserve an a++ awesome location atmosphere courteous caring enthusiastic staff
highly recommend
do not hesitate make that eye appointment now with ifocus
café nikki 's breakfast buffet be wonderful
-PRON- be not a buffet fan
at all but
when -PRON- involve fresh ripe fruit yogurt house make granola fresh squeeze juice and good coffee -PRON- can be convince
the patio overlook the pool be a great place to dine as well
the dumpling here rock
-PRON- eat -PRON- stupid and then eat more
-PRON- friend have to roll -PRON- out of this place listen to -PRON- whining as -PRON- unsuccessfully try to walk the food off for about 45 minute and feed -PRON- shot in an attempt to break down the food and speed up digestion so -PRON- belly could stop stretch
would -PRON- do -PRON- again
absolutely
-PRON- have the boil chicken and mushroom dumpling the steamed beef and chive dumpling the green onion pancake and the steamed shrimp egg and chive dumpling
all be more delicious than the next
the place be very affordable on top of -PRON- all -PRON- tab be $ 33 for two of -PRON- plus tip
the next time -PRON- be on business travel in toronto -PRON- be come back here for another food coma
the grill cheese sandwich be amazing
very unique menu with a very charming atmosphere
definitely worth a stop in lawrenceville
this be the only thai restaurant -PRON- have recently try in the markham area for a sit in meal
in the three time -PRON- have be here these the past 12 month for dinner there be hardly any dine in customer but lot and lot of takeaway patron
-PRON- have try the golden curry green curry and pad thai
food piece in the curry could be chop into slightly small size but the curry all taste authentic
the pad thai noodle stick to each other a lot and be difficult to fork up without lob a huge chunk of noodle and though most people enjoy thai food because -PRON- be heavy on savoury sauce the noodle be too salty for -PRON- palate preference
portion be generous and staff be polite
but if -PRON- be go for a particular ambience to match the restaurant 's offering there be little to expect from -PRON- dark wall dim light and big tv screen television in restaurant have almost annihilate the art of dining and conversation
and -PRON- be still in mourning
if there be thai music play in this restaurant -PRON- do not even recall hear -PRON-
if -PRON- want authentic curry dish and do not mind the large portion of food then this be the place to go for dine in and takeout
for a good pad thai restaurant -PRON- would direct -PRON- to -PRON- recommendation for a small place in kitchener call northern thai
if -PRON- be look for an orientalized atmosphere to make a date night interesting -PRON- would not suggest this restaurant unless star at the television screen and -PRON- neighboring diner 's dish be -PRON- plan b exit out of an awkward firstdate

pardon the patronizing western term but this be the good one -PRON- can think of to describe any kitschy decor expectation reader may have when -PRON- think let -PRON- go get thai food and have an authentic thai experience in markham
ja bistro be absolutely fantastic
-PRON- fiancée and -PRON- go there to celebrate -PRON- 6-year anniversary as -PRON- both love sushi and want to taste something high end than the cheap ayce sushi that be widely available in toronto
service
the staff be extremely friendly and accommodate all fluent in english and most in japanese
-PRON- make sure to check on -PRON- every so often non intrusively to make sure that -PRON- be satisfied with -PRON- meal and to top -PRON- off on drink
ambience
the restaurant be small but nicely decorate with low light and modern furnishing
-PRON- sit at the sushi bar as -PRON- want to watch the sushi chef work -PRON- magic
the music playing be contemporary and fairly upbeat but interestingly enough traditional japanese opera be play in the bathroom
food
-PRON- both have the sushi nigiri taster and try the pear sake which be delicious
the chef give -PRON- a wide variety of fish include the much seek after toro fatty tuna unagi eel scallop top with roe and -PRON- favourite and other
the fish and rice be well prepared and -PRON- add to the delicious experience
price
the menu be quite costly -PRON- pay ~$80 each but that be very much expect for the quality of sushi that -PRON- be get especially in toronto where -PRON- do not have ready access to good fish
-PRON- highly recommend anyone go here so long as -PRON- enjoy sushi although if -PRON- do not there be cook option but in that case why be -PRON- din at a sushi restaurant
-PRON- be highly impressed with the entire experience and plan to return soon to have the sashimi platter big thick cut of that delicious fish
yes please
first -PRON- have to say that the atmosphere and decor here be so sweet
-PRON- be like a little cottage
-PRON- have only have pedicure here
so -PRON- can not comment on the hair or other service like wax or facial
there be no fancy pedicure chair with build in tub that constantly need to be sanitize with jet that could hold mold or bacteria and there be no weird odor like at some of the shop -PRON- have be to
-PRON- use metal tub at the pp that -PRON- fill by hand which be much easy to clean and reuse without any residue from the last person
the chair be like comfy chair -PRON- would have in -PRON- living room at home
-PRON- have cassandra for -PRON- first pedi on mother 's day of this year
and -PRON- be wonderful
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- have a client for life and -PRON- matter of factly tell -PRON- that anyone there could provide the same level of service as -PRON- do so if -PRON- ever need a service do and -PRON- be not available to be assure someone else would be as awesome as -PRON- be
-PRON- go back to -PRON- again last weekend for a pre bridal shower pedi and once again -PRON- be fabulous
the front desk staff and everyone who work there be friendly and personable and the owner megan be fantastic
-PRON- highly recommend a visit to the pampered pinkie

believe -PRON- be go to at least finish -PRON- sentence with where -PRON- could find -PRON- -PRON- wait for -PRON- response
when -PRON- finally respond -PRON- bark out ask what -PRON- want and tell -PRON- to leave as -PRON- basically push -PRON- out of the store
this to -PRON- speak horribly about this business
an owner that do not care about -PRON- customer
eventually -PRON- do give -PRON- direction to where -PRON- could find -PRON-
the wrong direction that be
-PRON- be not sure if -PRON- be intentional or not
but -PRON- find -PRON- very distasteful
-PRON- have only come across here once and do nothing to be treat this way
-PRON- believe -PRON- important to show the real side behind this business
-PRON- could have understand this response if -PRON- -PRON- be intrude in some way however -PRON- do not believe -PRON- be
-PRON- ask in the most gentle and respectful manner
-PRON- truly hope this business can reshape -PRON-
every time in vegas get to hit up the oxtail soup

-PRON- should add that although -PRON- be a bit overpriced the portion be large so -PRON- do get what -PRON- pay for
the service be okay -PRON- food get to -PRON- fairly quickly and the bartender be friendly enough
the pub stay open later than normal for -PRON- until about 10:30

this just add to the excitement
absolutely can not miss while visit freemont street
-PRON- be lack speed distance but who care
-PRON- be extremely fun
the hard part be push off the platform when the guy release the trigger -PRON- let go of fear know -PRON- be hooked fly thru the air in a harnest good feeling

feel comfortable safe and happy

this place be without a question one of -PRON- favorite place to go in the city
rarely -PRON- boyfriend

and -PRON- do not even question where -PRON- be go anymore
-PRON- greektown george the owner be here 7 day a week
-PRON- know some other reviewer have take some issue with -PRON- but -PRON- be a genuine hard work guy who just want to make -PRON- customer happy
do not judge the book by -PRON- cover
the surrounding be weird but once -PRON- get inside -PRON- forget about the area and enjoy the nice decor and quiet pleasant atmosphere
the first time -PRON- go -PRON- try to order some random appetizer and george insist -PRON- get the calamari
-PRON- think this be weird for someone to do but -PRON- be right
-PRON- be not only amazing but to this day the good calamari -PRON- have ever have
so fresh -PRON- lick up every bite with the pita and garlic bread and -PRON- be usually one to try and not eat everything in a meal
-PRON- almost always have the greek salad with gyro meat
the veggie be fresh and delicious
-PRON- always leave happy not only enjoy the taste but see someone work so hard and genuinely care about -PRON- business and take a really active part in -PRON-
if -PRON- can get up here -PRON- be absolutely worth -PRON-
pretty schnazzy hotel stay here at hotel 10
-PRON- interior decor and layout remind -PRON- greatly of what -PRON- would find at a w hotel
the bed be wickedly comfortable and there be plenty of space to move around
the hotel be also conveniently locate to many of the sight in montreal
-PRON- just park the car when -PRON- arrive and do not need to touch -PRON- until -PRON- be ready to leave
-PRON- be a bit small in size 5 floor only and the bathroom separation from the bedroom be awkward but overall -PRON- be a pretty good stay and very clean
-PRON- just order this place for work and not only do the owner personally deliver -PRON- food but -PRON- look amazing
-PRON- order arrive about one minute before the exact time -PRON- want -PRON- which be a weird time
the pizza look so delicious and the wing smell good

-PRON- like -PRON-
-PRON- have have a few different item and all good
-PRON- really like the garlic knot
-PRON- be small but so tastey

the good thing that come out odd
-PRON- visit be -PRON- server tell -PRON- about chez francois in vermillion where -PRON- go regularly now
wait in line for about 40 minute to get up to the counter
the person at the counter say -PRON- would take another 10 15 minute to get -PRON- car because -PRON- be clean the car -PRON- would be rent
upon return the vehicle -PRON- do a very thorough check for any damage and find a pin hole sized chip in the windshield for which -PRON- write up a report and get -PRON- insurance info for

straight shooting bartender with live music
sit down chill out and have several drink
uptight pretentious folk keep walk
-PRON- love -PRON- all absolutely everything
-PRON- have never be disappoint at detroit in about 13 year of go to this spot
there be only one store -PRON- find more boring than best buy and that be a certain home improvement store -PRON- will not mention here
needless to say -PRON- avoid best buy as much as -PRON- possibly can
-PRON- be not the type of person who feel the need to keep up with all the new techie gadget and spend way too much money on these silly novelty item that will only be out of date in a month or two so when -PRON- do find -PRON- in need of a practical item from this store -PRON- ultimate goal be to get in and out as efficiently and cheaply as possible
-PRON- find -PRON- in such a need recently and luckily the service here be friendly and relatively competent
-PRON- find a sale associate to help -PRON- locate the item -PRON- need and -PRON- be in and out in no time
that be all -PRON- can ask for when -PRON- be shop here
-PRON- vegan pad thai be really good
-PRON- friend order the duck

get some bad news about -PRON- truck the repair will be more costly than -PRON- would hop but the tech be honest and upfront about everything
break down all the charge and help -PRON- prioritize what need to be do asap and what could wait till next paycheck
-PRON- be not up sell anything
-PRON- seem content with get -PRON- truck in good working order same day
this everything -PRON- want from a mechanic
try this place with a restaurant.com certificate
-PRON- be dead empty on weekend night that should have be a clue
-PRON- no longer offer all the thing on the menu show at restaurant.com
do not seem to have as many bento box selection as previously show
-PRON- now seem to be either teppanyaki or kind of a japanese tapas
try the tapas and regret -PRON-
while the food be not bad -PRON- be not good
the portion be small and overpriced
service be good
but -PRON- do not have anyone else to wait on
-PRON- have be search for a stylist for month and randomly find this salon
-PRON- first visit be for a wash style and -PRON- be lucky to be style by shanti
so be professional and let -PRON- show -PRON- what -PRON- want and

monkey be quite happy with second visit
the management have obviously listen to the review and make change
check -PRON- out
take -PRON- daughter to get -PRON- hair do for the first time at tony 's
-PRON- want full highlight jeffery do an absolutely amazing job with -PRON- hair
-PRON- have really mixed feeling about this place
the back office staff be great and the doctor have a very friendly manner but -PRON- have some shady billing practice that -PRON- just can not get past
-PRON- be definitely be out to get -PRON- money
and -PRON- will charge an insane amount to -PRON- insurance
one simple appointment of a 10-min adjustment and 40 minute of simple stretch exercise should not cost $ 1,000 +
-PRON- stop go after -PRON- see a few month of the bill -PRON- be charge -PRON- insurance
but the people be great
after all drama -PRON- have to go through kim from california
and -PRON- now become great acquaintance
manger do not remember -PRON- name)came to -PRON- place to put temporary blind while -PRON- be wait for the order
and leave -PRON- for -PRON- other blind when -PRON- ore have arrive
that be a great makeup
thank -PRON- for all wonderful service
-PRON- be just take communication that be all
decide to hit up cowbell for a late saturday night dinner date with the hubby
since -PRON- get there around 9:00 -PRON- do not have to wait at all for a table
-PRON- be seat immediately and have a server at -PRON- table very quickly after that
-PRON- order the devil egg w\/bacon as an appetizer -PRON- be delicious
-PRON- order the boogan 's bacon burger for dinner w\/sweet potato tot as -PRON- side
the tot be amazing if -PRON- like sweet potato -PRON- highly recommend try these
even though -PRON- taste excellent -PRON- be extremely disappointed at the size of -PRON- burger
the onion roll be a generous size but the patty underneath be more the size of a slider than an actual burger
aside from that one negative -PRON- have a very enjoyable dining experience will definitely go back
there be several other item on -PRON- menu that look like must try 's
cowbell have a funky modern decor and although -PRON- can be a bit loud inside -PRON- have a really cool atmosphere
-PRON- stylist be friendly and -PRON- do an ok job but nothing outstanding and this salon be way overpriced
the food be amazeball
-PRON- love -PRON- taco and the tuesday special
the app let -PRON- preorder and earn reward for free food
-PRON- get hectic busy during lunch and often line be out the door
-PRON- do recommend use the app to pre order and pick -PRON- up either to go or to eat there
-PRON- do not like many crowd and the table with chair be kinda snug put together
people have a hard time get out of there dodge sitting area
the freshly make tortilla and soft taco be make in front of -PRON- while -PRON- be in line wait to order -PRON- love -PRON-
there have be time
when -PRON- pre order online and -PRON- food still be not ready in time because -PRON- get really busy
the food be totally worth -PRON- though
love this place
-PRON- get kick down a notch now
this be because of -PRON- online ordering experience
-PRON- recently try to place an order for pickup
-PRON- should add that -PRON- will not take an order over the phone only online through a site call chow now
the problem be not all of the topping and protein be list as option online that -PRON- have in the store
when pick sauce -PRON- will only allow -PRON- to select one
if -PRON- would like two protein -PRON- will only allow -PRON- to select one
there be a comment section if -PRON- would like a special request but -PRON- limit the character use by tell -PRON- too long after -PRON- have already fill the whole thing out
if -PRON- call the store -PRON- will not take the order even if -PRON- be have trouble get what -PRON- would like through the app
this could be easily fix by allow more character in the comment section or by add the thing that be not list and allow the user to choose more than one option in the sauce and protein category
be in town for a 24 hour work trip
recommend by -PRON- air bnb host so glad i come for a late lunch before get on -PRON- return flight

wild
-PRON- be very family friendly reasonably price and good of all the menu have a little something for everyone
there be a large variety of breakfast item as well as afternoon item which -PRON- have at 11:30am
so -PRON- guess -PRON- be just what -PRON- call that section but do not mean -PRON- have to wait until noon
the interior be big and cool with a fun surprise on the ceiling
everyone here have a great attitude very friendly and attentive even when -PRON- be busy
-PRON- can call ahead of time and check out the wait time -PRON- will most likely be 5 10 minute
parking be plentiful but not really shade there be ton of other store locate in this shopping center such as a grocery store and other restaurant
will definitely be return next time
-PRON- be head to las vegas
like this venue
the atmosphere and location be great
the only thing -PRON- would suggest be more table in the back and definitely more bartender
as always at show drink price be high
recommend a drink special during show like $ 5 pounder or something
hit omnia calvin harris on memorial weekend
-PRON- friend and -PRON- have one of the good night out in along time
brian pfeiffer 773 459 8133 be -PRON- vip host and sort everything out before -PRON- even arrive in vegas

club be amazing lot of hot chick music be bang
great coffee and smoothie but service be hit or miss
-PRON- have great service once the other time make -PRON- not want to come back
-PRON- first come to veronica to have -PRON- make up do for -PRON- wedding
-PRON- be highly recommend to -PRON- by a girlfriend of mine
-PRON- be quite nervous at first this be -PRON- wedding day after all
i want to have a very natural look since -PRON- wedding be outdoors with a country chic theme
-PRON- turn out prefect
so many people compliment -PRON- eye look
-PRON- hair come out classy perfect exactly what i want
-PRON- definately take -PRON- time in listening understanding and deliver what i want
-PRON- make great suggestion that pay off eyelash
after -PRON- first experience -PRON- decide to give -PRON- a chance with haircolor
-PRON- nail -PRON-
-PRON- hair be very difficult to color and often time do not take grey -PRON- let -PRON- know that surprisingly -PRON- be make -PRON- happen
-PRON- love -PRON- color
-PRON- be be a year and half since -PRON- wedding now -PRON- highly recommend and look forward to continue to come to -PRON-
so disappointed
-PRON- think this place be all about customization
-PRON- have be look forward to try this place for so long
order the turkey cabbage wrap
order to go
in the instruction -PRON- ask for no cheese and no rice
as soon as -PRON- pick -PRON- up all -PRON- see be rice
take the cabbage wrap off
so -PRON- could just eat the meat
and -PRON- be 80 rice and 20 meat
and that be a generous estimate
to top -PRON- off there be a few shred of cheese probably 6 which make -PRON- think -PRON- -PRON- have the cheese on -PRON- and someone pick -PRON- off and that alone kind of worry -PRON-
really want this to be -PRON- go to place for healthy customizable eat but -PRON- better keep look
appreciate ya dutch bro
yummy coffee
super friendly
drive thru
so -PRON- can be lazy and not exert any energy to get -PRON- caffeine fix
-PRON- want to call in a to go order for -PRON- and -PRON- kid but the management of chelsea 's kitchen in all of -PRON- wisdom decide that -PRON- can not do that after 5
-PRON- need to order in person and sit in the restaurant and wait
take -PRON- business elsewhere
-PRON- love this place
if -PRON- let -PRON- know what -PRON- be look for -PRON- shape will be perfect
easy quick and much more comfortable than wax
-PRON- will love -PRON-
the only reason -PRON- be give this place 2 star be strictly because of the dessert which be incredible
-PRON- have the red velvet cupcake lemon cake and tiramisu all of which be vegan and delicious and very hard to believe -PRON- be low in calorie
now for the bad -PRON- lunch
-PRON- mom and -PRON- each order a taco salad without any meat real or vegan
the thing have ton of rice very few black bean a small bit of cheese and avocado and be serve with salsa
-PRON- have to ask for a lot of extra salsa because -PRON- be so bland
when the server come over to bring the salsa -PRON- mention to -PRON- that -PRON- both have the salad without any meat and still have to pay the full $ 11.95 completely outrageous for the quality
-PRON- ask if -PRON- could have some extra avocado to make up for -PRON-
-PRON- immediately get an attitude explain that everyone try to modify the food here so -PRON- absolutely will not do any modification
-PRON- then add that -PRON- could of course order some extra avocado for $ 1
of course $ 1 be not a big deal but that be also why -PRON- could have just give -PRON- to -PRON- -PRON- attitude be a huge factor in -PRON- dining experience
-PRON- 4y\/o who be sleep at the time -PRON- order wake up and be hungry
-PRON- do not have a kid menu and the guy behind the counter say people usually order mac\/cheese or the pizzetta for kid
each of which be $ 9
-PRON- order the vegan pizzetta for -PRON- and hop for the good
-PRON- take forever to make and there be not many other people in the restaurant
-PRON- son be seriously cry because -PRON- be take so long
-PRON- come out and look ok
too bad
-PRON- taste -PRON- and -PRON- be awful
-PRON- be shock to hear people rave about the vegan cheese here because -PRON- be really horrible and slimy
-PRON- mom also try -PRON- and say the same thing
-PRON- poor hungry son barely would eat one piece
-PRON- be too afraid to send -PRON- back after the attitude the waiter give -PRON-
oh -PRON- should also mention that -PRON- come with a very plain green salad only green and vinaigrette
really how many 4y\/o would eat that
-PRON- would think -PRON- could at least have give -PRON- some baked fry or chip but remember absolutely no modification here
by the time -PRON- order dessert -PRON- get a new server not sure if the snotty one do not want to deal with -PRON- or what
the new server -PRON- wish -PRON- know -PRON- name be hispanic and wonderful so sweet and nice thank god
-PRON- order the delicious dessert from -PRON- and even order 2 to go
even though the dessert be decent sized -PRON- still seem over price
-PRON- dessert bill be $ 30
-PRON- should also mention -PRON- gross lunch bill be $ 44 include a tip
so -PRON- spend about $ 75 which just seem completely outrageous could have have a fancy dinner out for that
-PRON- would never come back here for the food but would get the dessert to go again sometime
-PRON- call and reserve 2 box 12\/box for pick up around 3 week in advance
after read many comment and friend testimonial -PRON- be nervous that when -PRON- get there -PRON- may not have -PRON- order
luckily -PRON- call -PRON- when -PRON- be stick in traffic on -PRON- way there to make sure and yea -PRON- do not have -PRON- order but the lady be kind and say -PRON- can make -PRON- now for pick up this be around 4:45pm
there be 2 location
one be on the second floor inside pacific mall and the other be at another building next to pacific mall call market village
so if -PRON- do be pick up -PRON- order go to market village
both place do not have much customer
-PRON- think there would be line of people but there be not
guess -PRON- choose a good day to go and pick up
when -PRON- get to the market village location the lady have -PRON- order pack in 2 box and write how many be in each box
-PRON- be kind i expect rude and attitude people as per comment read on yelp and friend
-PRON- also confirm the price for the egg roll 4.50 bag
-PRON- also get an order of egg waffle $ 3\/ea or 2 for $ 5)after
i pay -PRON- -PRON- give -PRON- an extra bag of egg waffle for free
-PRON- hand -PRON- to -PRON- with a smile
-PRON- be surprised because after read so many negative review the last thing -PRON- would expect be a free egg waffle lol
-PRON- taste good not like hk egg waffle quality but still good and crispy on the side
there be an elderly make the egg roll
overall -PRON- expectation be off
guess -PRON- will not know what to expect until -PRON- be there
go to herringbone to celebrate -PRON- good friend upcoming wedding
great service and food be amazing
thank -PRON- ollie for the hospitality
the location be convenient but -PRON- be not a fan of the food
-PRON- have shrimp and chinese veggie and crab rangoon
-PRON- cut the veggie way too big and the sauce be bland
-PRON- will not go back for food but the crab rangoon be ok
-PRON- do not give any sauce
-PRON- have to ask for -PRON-
that suck
die brezel gehört in stuttgart ja schon fast zu einem kulturgut
umso wichtiger ist es für stuttgarter den richtigen brezel becker zu finden
für meinen geschmack gibt
es beim
becker sailer die besten brezeln der stadt
in der regel sogar noch ofenwarm
ich schaffe es selten hi unter vi brezeln an diesem bäcker vorbei zu komman
auch die sonstigen backwaren sind sehr zu empfehlen
-PRON- be so good
most of -PRON- dog be difficult to handle and -PRON- seem to do a great job
thank cindy
great drunchie spot
-PRON- think joe 's be good tho
-PRON- actually have a collection of picture of people who have fall asleep at gus
maybe -PRON- will upload -PRON- later lol
fantastic upscale eatery in the detroit shoreway neighborhood
great place to grab dinner with friend or a date
excellent pizza
-PRON- have an amazing patio
the service depend on who -PRON- get as -PRON- waiter -PRON- have be there three or four time and have one very rude waiter or perhaps -PRON- be just have a very bad evening and three nice knowledgeable one
highly recommend
worth visit even for east sider
-PRON- dessert be good
but -PRON- also recommend go to sweet moses across the street for -PRON- awesome cleveland theme ice cream
not too happy anymore with kfc
lunch special 3 wing snack and a snack a biscuit plus a regular taco and bean burrito disappointment with the wing
the wing be get small and small
-PRON- look the size of a pigeon not a chicken
taco and bean burrito save the day
now -PRON- may be ask be -PRON- really the only cafe
well no
but -PRON- definitely be one of the good
a friend of -PRON- who will remain nameless catch wind of a cafe in town which serve -PRON- kind of beer at really really ridiculously cheap price
-PRON- know -PRON- could not let that information just slide so -PRON- go to check -PRON- out
turn out the only be probably one of the good place in the city to enjoy import beer
at these price -PRON- be practically steal
wonderful experience which be enhance by the amazing atmosphere and chill clientele
-PRON- have such a great time -PRON- can not wait to go back
-PRON- be not a sweet person but sweet moses be still a must hit
-PRON- favorite be the $ 2 phosphate
-PRON- may take a while to pour but the effort be palatable
-PRON- be fizzy tasty -PRON- love the lime\/ginger and mango and an excellent way to savor the gordon square area
great little mom and pop thai place
locate in a strip mall but inside be clean
standard thai fare
pad thai be one of -PRON- favorite in the valley the noodle be thin and sticky with not too much sauce just the way -PRON- like -PRON-
portion be generous
panang curry look bland because -PRON- do not put any garnish on -PRON- however -PRON- be actually really flavorful with a hint of sweetness
there be also a generous helping of chicken in the curry
all in all a great experience -PRON- will be back
-PRON- love salon tru friendly staff and excellent service
emily have be do -PRON- hair for year and -PRON- do a fantastic job
-PRON- change the style or color of -PRON- hair almost every time -PRON- go in for an appointment and emily have no problem with keep up with -PRON- crazy request
-PRON- be great
thank -PRON- so much
terminal 4 be know for -PRON- be local flare
arizona native will recognize eatery like chelsea 's kitchen lgo sir veza 's cartel to name a few
really -PRON- be awesome in theory
if only all these delicious option be actually locate in the gate area after security
-PRON- be not often that -PRON- get to fly through terminal 4 so perhaps -PRON- should have familiarize -PRON- with the map in advance but as -PRON- stand the d gate be underwhelming- lgo and barrio tequila be the food option and folk in need of a work station good luck
limited seating narrow table and uncomfortable stool make for looong connection
-PRON- think -PRON- be safe to say that most people travel with electronic device so instead of invest all this money into the gallery area that seem to host the majority of all the shop and dining before security -PRON- should make the gate area worthy of -PRON- time and money and spruce -PRON- up with more charge station modernize a bit and bring some of those shops\/eaterie into the gate area
-PRON- be thankful that this section of the airport do not smell like cinnabon and burger king
one of the bad place to go if -PRON- expect good customer service and an actual meal
-PRON- girlfriend and -PRON- receive some of the bad customer service -PRON- have ever have
first the waitress bring -PRON- the wrong beer and proceed to argue with -PRON- say that -PRON- be not the wrong one
then -PRON- wait for over an hour for -PRON- food
the whole time -PRON- waitress stop by and ask if -PRON- be ok twice
-PRON- never offer a reason to why -PRON- be take so long
after -PRON- stopping by to ask if -PRON- need anything else -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- never even receive -PRON- food
-PRON- go back and say that -PRON- be still make -PRON-
-PRON- have to flag -PRON- down to tell -PRON- that -PRON- just want to pay for -PRON- drink and leave
-PRON- then take more of -PRON- time to get the check process
-PRON- still end up pay for -PRON- drink and the floor leader never once stop by to apologize for the wait
-PRON- comp -PRON- with game card for the video game
-PRON- turn those in to the front desk and the girl at the front be no good
when -PRON- say -PRON- be not come back because of the terrible service -PRON- just say ok
-PRON- would say save -PRON- money and go to a location that actually care about -PRON- customer
expensive but to be expect
-PRON- be a kid place and -PRON- pay for the atmosphere not the food
go for the cobb salad or salmon
everything else be eh
-PRON- have a good service with snack in the morning
-PRON- go in for a refinance notice for -PRON- vehicle
but -PRON- end up trade -PRON- up and could not return -PRON-
-PRON- do not have a 3 day cool off
-PRON- ask a few time if -PRON- could take back the car or some of the warranty -PRON- get
and -PRON- deny -PRON- anything
so
-PRON- be just really disappointed
amazing food and great ambiance
the decor in this place will make -PRON- think -PRON- be in california or some beach outside of montreal
the food be really good and staff be young and super helpful
the service be quite fast and -PRON- be good if -PRON- do not go during peak hour to be seat right away
-PRON- cocktail be great and with a nice kick
-PRON- definitely recommend this place
ps
-PRON- music playlist be so freak good
-PRON- want no not want need to get a brown bag sandwiches t shirt if such a thing exist
if -PRON- do not -PRON- will have to pitch -PRON- on the idea
-PRON- can safely say that -PRON- affinity for t shirt for place people or thing that -PRON- like have be somewhat of an obsession over the year but -PRON- save this compulsion for only the decidedly deserved and bbs
be more than deserve
this be a place that -PRON- immediately feel at home in
no one will judge -PRON- if the guac or chipotle aioli from the delectable fried chicken sandwich slide down -PRON- chin because chance be the person sit across from -PRON- suffer from a similar affliction
the sandwich be so good here that -PRON- will literally drool as -PRON- be be create before -PRON- very eye
the fry chicken and guac sandwich be a killer combo
the chicken be tender and moist and the guac have a zippy kick which be compliment perfectly by pair -PRON- with the crispy house make chip
and be even good when wash down with coke in a bottle
yes coke in a bottle
-PRON- do most thing on site here include homemade ketchup and smoke bacon
and -PRON- be not afraid to experiment with thing that may not be typically associate with standard sandwich fare such as house cure pork belly with char tomato relish and salmon with maple syrup sandwhich
and although -PRON- have yet to try these two know that -PRON- will and -PRON- dear yelper should too
so if -PRON- happen to see a man stroll somewhere in the annex or just loiter outside bbs don a tee with a familiar brown bag emblazon across the front chance be -PRON- be successful in -PRON- pitch
this be a shirt -PRON- will inevitably wear with pride and hope that -PRON- consider -PRON- on any subsequent merchandising kick back
-PRON- will not take any form of monetary compensation though -PRON- will only accept payment in snadwhich form
$ 60 cover
no thank
nuf say
definitely one of three favorite buffet for -PRON- down on the strip
-PRON- eat here last year but forget to create a post on yelp
so here -PRON- go
this place be the typical large selection of food but -PRON- come with great quality
-PRON- wish -PRON- could list all the food -PRON- eat here
but -PRON- forget and there be too many of -PRON-
-PRON- do enjoy how the chef seem to cook something different even while -PRON- be there
not the typical cooking in bulk and bring out the next bin concept
the décor be fantastic along with the plating of the food in the buffet line
-PRON- do wish the price be drop a little but hey -PRON- be in vegas where all the tourist come to eat and be entertain right
thank for the great experience
good chinese -PRON- have find in four state
egg flower soup be divine and whatev the silver wrapped chicken be so good -PRON- will want to snort -PRON-
-PRON- love the atmosphere
an eccentric artist be definitely involved in the decor
-PRON- remind -PRON- of the house on the rock in wisconsin by the artist 's style
-PRON- may creep -PRON- out though if -PRON- have a few too many and sit down by one of the crazy manikin pair
an add bonus for -PRON-
-PRON- toddler could feed the geese leftover bread that -PRON- leave out great way of keep -PRON- entertain while everyone be finish up
-PRON- be -PRON- first trip there
definitely a great place to eat after a day at the beach
-PRON- have lunch sandwich which be awesome
perch and chicken sandwich with a really great honey mustard sauce
-PRON- go at about 3:00 on a monday of a holiday weekend and there be no wait
-PRON- do not frequent gnc often and when -PRON- be there -PRON- be normally try to get in get a smoothie an get out
the staff behind the register be way to into -PRON- and can not even break off -PRON- own conversation to acknowledge a customer
the smoothie be great but the customer interaction could be good
the garlic sauce be to die for
the service be fast and friendly price be fair and the food be great
one of -PRON- favorite place to eat
the waitress deal w alot of bad customer come through here and deal w -PRON- great
tip -PRON- waitress

-PRON- can only say that -PRON- call -PRON- twice over the last 10 day to arrange an appointment
urban forest tell -PRON- brian would call
-PRON- still have not receive a call
-PRON- would think a call back within 48 hour would be reasonable
-PRON- can not imagine what would happen if -PRON- have an emergency
-PRON- will look somewhere else for this service
this be one of the large grocery store near the university of edinburgh and -PRON- have stop in a few time to pick up food and use the cash machine
-PRON- be quite busy during the evening

this place be a joke
-PRON- get the brisket which be normally good
-PRON- mean how can -PRON- go wrong with thin un marinate meat
boy be -PRON- wrong

the samgyupsal or the bacon be the same way
and the 2 piece of galbi should have be out of this world amazing since -PRON- limit -PRON- in -PRON-
nope
-PRON- be thinly slice and full of fat
the flavor be off
-PRON- spend $ 30 on the bbq and do not even eat -PRON-

terrible
-PRON- be run around all yesterday try to get a specific file from -PRON- computer transfer to a dvd

however -PRON- have a new birthday watch from the b\/f that need the band adjust so really how hard be that
well not hard at all

this be a family own business on water street that have give -PRON- good service both time -PRON- have be here
the end
let -PRON- start off by say -PRON- wish -PRON- could rate this 4.5 star
-PRON- friend and -PRON- go to bsbc last week and so many thing look appeal to -PRON- that -PRON- end up order 4 entree to split between the two of -PRON-
2 of the entree -PRON- order -PRON- would give 4 star and the other 2 -PRON- would give 5 star
butternut and blue salad- 5 stars
this be easily one of -PRON- favorite salad that -PRON- can remember have
super unique flavor that all compliment each other extremely well
on top of that the portion be wonderfully large so -PRON- could actually be fill if that be all -PRON- choose to order
chicken cimichurri- 4 stars
really tasty sandwich that -PRON- would definitely order again sometime
-PRON- order -PRON- with tater tot which be good but -PRON- would recommend order -PRON- with the tomato soup that -PRON- have
-PRON- do not try -PRON- but -PRON- think the combo would be awesome and -PRON- server vouch for the soup
mac attack- 4 stars
-PRON- think this be quite delicious and a unique upscale take on an old favorite but -PRON- friend be not a big fan
-PRON- do not have -PRON- typical cheese and include both butternut squash and kale which -PRON- think be very tasty
but if -PRON- think -PRON- be order standard mac -PRON- may be throw off a little
ravioli- 5
stars
-PRON- friend and -PRON- both agree this be -PRON- favorite
not much to say except for the fact -PRON- be delicious and -PRON- both wish the portion be large
bsbc be know for -PRON- breakfast and doughnut and -PRON- do not take advantage of either during this visit but base on how much -PRON- enjoy -PRON- dinner -PRON- will definitely be back

je suis malheureusement très déçu de mon expérience à ce restaurant
situé dan le vieux montréal ce très joli restaurant semblait beaucoup promettre
mai malheureusement ce ne fut pas le cas
après nous avoir amener à notre table il semble qu'il nous ont oublié
il a fallu 25 minute et des regard insistant à l'ensemble du staff on a daigné venir nous voir pour prendre notre commande
le serveur l'ayant perdu il est venu reprendre une deuxième fois 10 minute plus tard
après 40 minute nous avon reçu nos verr d'eau
la soupe dall quoique en petite quantité
était délicieuse mai bon après pratiquement 50 minute d'attente nous étion affamé
nous avon pris l'entrée assortie comprenant 2 morceaux de poulet tikka miniscule et 1 peu sec 2 oignon bhaji excellent 1 salade de la iceberg avec des concombre et de la vinaigrette français kraft et 1 samosa tout simplement repoussant
les plat principaux nous ont été amenés plus de 90 minute après notre arrivé au restaurant
nous avon choisi 1 poulet au beurre 1 poulet dansak ainsi qu'un plat de poulet sag
en accompagnement 1 nan nature et 1 nan coriandre et ail
ce plat était correct le poulet au beurre étant particulièrement bon
je -PRON- questionne cependant sur le nan nature qui ressemblait plus à 1 pita
au blé enti qu'à un nan
plusieur table ont semblé éprouver des problème avec le service car nous entendon du commentair et certaine insatisfaction de la part d'au moin 3 autre table
en gro malgré le joli décor il
y a un sérieux problème au niveau du service
la cuisine quoique correct semble aussi avoir beaucoup de problème
à exécuter en un temp acceptable les commande des client
dommage
yeahhh
this place hit the spot
-PRON- get here pretty late after a long drive from ca
-PRON- be cold and rain
-PRON- need something to warm -PRON- up
the soup base have a good flavor
for what -PRON- could remember the portion size be big enough to share
lot of meat and green fill -PRON- bowl just how -PRON- like -PRON-
service be good and fast
-PRON- will be back again
how be -PRON- fair that urbana have a vegan restaurant and all the way in naperville -PRON- have to settle for -PRON- infrequent trip to the city in order to eat at a restaurant that actually serve food -PRON- will eat
yes -PRON- be jealous
the menu here be not super extensive but -PRON- actually really like that in a vegan restaurant
-PRON- spend less time agonizing over what to order and more time look forward to eat -PRON-
-PRON- get a seitan reuben and -PRON- live up to all of -PRON- expectation
-PRON- do think -PRON- be on the rather small side but -PRON- be still fill and come with a nice heap pile of fry
yummmmm
-PRON- guess -PRON- will just have to be back to visit -PRON- good friend in urbana more often and try out the rest of the menu
i absolutely love max brenner
if -PRON- have guest in town -PRON- take -PRON- here
there be not many location across the -PRON- so -PRON- a good treat
the dessert be sooooo yummy
the savory food be pretty good too try the pull pork sandwhich
if -PRON- be visit definitely try this spot out
-PRON- be locate in the forum shop at ceasar
be really impressed with the food and service of this place
the restaurant be not huge tuck away in a strip mall
decent wine list
really great pie
one of the good -PRON- have eat
-PRON- all order red sauce
so -PRON- can not comment on the white
the other dish that be a hit be the halibut taco
-PRON- do not taste -PRON- but the dh like -PRON- very much
would now go back again in a heart beat
just have dinner there with friend
pretty good
have risotto braised beef ceviche cone -PRON- be so tiny and fritter present poorly but taste okay
dessert -PRON- have creme brûlée not so good and -PRON- version of cheesecake
will visit there again but portion be small and pricey
ambience be a bit dark and sleepy
music a little too loud sometimes
nice indoor cafe if -PRON- be already in the area
-PRON- stay at aria with a few friend and with everything in vegas be so spread out this be -PRON- go to place for brunch
-PRON- have the cobb salad which be pretty good
all the serving be pretty large and the service be really good
nothing too standoutish about the place aside that -PRON- use natural lighting with the window
any building in vegas that actually let -PRON- see outside be a plus in -PRON- book
overall a ok
but -PRON- would mainly recommend this place if -PRON- be already in the aria hotel and want to grab a bit to eat but not if -PRON- need to make a special trip to the hotel
party of 10 for happy hour
be ask to move entire party to the other side of the restaurant
then be ask to pay the $ 328 bill and leave bc there be a wait for seating
will never return
this be quite an upgrade from the prior bbq that be here
very good side very good rib
the sausage be good but be from the midwest lack some of the personality of the sausage in the austin area
now the brisket
not impressed
-PRON- really enjoy the food but this be where -PRON- fall short on authentic
midwood smokehouse have nail a great brisket but the whole sauced and grill of a piece of precooked and cool brisket just do not do -PRON-
staff have be great on several visit
-PRON- favoite sport bar by far
-PRON- can not think of one thing -PRON- do not like
the food awesome the drink be innexpensive -PRON- have get deal every day and the waitress be extremely friendly
if -PRON- be look for a place to hang out watch the game or have a great night -PRON- would definitely say go here
every time
what a cute hotel on the las vegas strip
the hotel casino and bar be trendy
the casino be small but clean and non smoky
-PRON- simply love the room
-PRON- amenity give -PRON- an old feel but the room be very cute and quaint
there be a popular night club in the hotel
if -PRON- call -PRON- a night early -PRON- will hear club music
-PRON- still highly recommend the cromwell

-PRON- son struggle with potty training at home
-PRON- potty train -PRON- fully in a couple week only
-PRON- have -PRON- go 5 day a week
so -PRON- can rotate through all the specialty class offer
-PRON- really like the cooking class
-PRON- even ask to go to school even on the weekend
-PRON- have never have -PRON- in any type of daycare or school setting before
so -PRON- be a little hesitate to enroll -PRON-
but -PRON- be sell on the the safety feature offer like security camara lock front entry and ceiling to floor glass wall
the front desk lady always greet -PRON- when -PRON- come in out
the school be very modern and clean
only minus be that the tuition be pricey
but the value be there
-PRON- look at 5 other school in the area and nobody else compare
most other school look more like a daycare versus school
over all -PRON- be very happy here
great value delicious food
be there quite a few time now
-PRON- have only try burrito and the wet burrito
setup be similar to chipotle but santos lucha libre have more option and good food
-PRON- love chipotle but to compare santos to chipotle be a slap in the face to santos
-PRON- have a sign out front that read 1 pound burrito
-PRON- burrito be massive so out of curiosity -PRON- weigh -PRON- 1.5 pound
con -PRON- restaurant be theme around professional wrestling so -PRON- have mask all over the place and -PRON- be creepy as hell
because of the decor -PRON- could never eat there -PRON- always get -PRON- food to go
casino margaritas and beer pong
what else
-PRON- have a brilliant night out with friend here
-PRON- like the decor and the margaritas i taste a few of -PRON- be really nice even
so -PRON- think -PRON- be a bit too sweet
the good thing for -PRON- be the cultural discovery of beer pong
-PRON- have never play before and thoroughly enjoy -PRON-
and the look on the face of all the lad play who think -PRON- look a bit out of place with -PRON- lovely dress and fascinator in -PRON- hair as most place on the strip drink be expensive and -PRON- be very touristy but still good fun
glad -PRON- come across handyman services

have dinner here last night
cute place
but for what -PRON- spend on a couple burger fry and beer -PRON- could do better elsewhere
-PRON- only give this place 3 star due to the price long wait to be acknowledge at the bar and get -PRON- first round
start out with the buffalo wing with mild sauce and that be pretty good because -PRON- be crispy
-PRON- be seat at the bar when -PRON- notice the couple next to -PRON- seem to be wait a long time for -PRON- food
-PRON- order grill cheese sandwich and that be at least 20 25 minute
next -PRON- receive the burgers
-PRON- order a few minute after -PRON- finish the wing
perfect timing
the burger -PRON- have be the angus with bleu cheese
awesome
fry be nothing special
luckily for -PRON- -PRON- request 1000 island on the side because have -PRON- be on the burger -PRON- would have leave
-PRON- have a feeling that would be a wise move because after taste -PRON- -PRON- notice a heavy dose of cinnamon in the dressing
whoever have the idea to do this should be slap
do not overthink thing people 1000
the traditional way be what -PRON- be after
wife have the kobe burger
love -PRON- and -PRON- choose wisely with the onion ring
-PRON- be jealous
way better than the boxed frozen variety
anyway -PRON- would come back but this place appear to be run by amateur
-PRON- do not want to be mean but the lack of teamwork and everyone on the staff look like -PRON- just do kind of whatev -PRON- want
maybe a good candidate for kitchen nightmares or bar rescue
just terrible
-PRON- go in and have a new barber give -PRON- a cut -PRON- mistake all the way
and -PRON- will take that
-PRON- be -PRON- first time get a haircut by a chick
-PRON- be talk during the cut and -PRON- learn that -PRON- be a rookie and do not have a passion for cutting and be just try to get -PRON- hustle game on
half way through the cut -PRON- notice several patch on -PRON- head and -PRON- have to practically hold -PRON- hand to get the rest of the cut do properly
apparently no one else work there
-PRON- get in there primetime between 5 and 8 on a wednesday
the place be empty
the owner of the place only take client by appointment and the rest of the staff be hack who do not show up to work leave the rookie to bottom feed
never again
pittsburgh be in short supply of decent urban barbershop that cater to an upscale clientele
if -PRON- think this place be -PRON- do not waste -PRON- time or $ 23
buck like -PRON- do
-PRON- be an expensive lesson that no one else should have to learn
good service -PRON- be a refreshing experience after the west flamingo shop
thank heaven
-PRON- be an interesting experience
some of the thing there may have be overprice but -PRON- be nice to see some handmade item in there
just keep a lookout and compare price
-PRON- do hit a necklace fix there at a jewelry store
-PRON- be a very reasonable price -PRON- think that moment
but when -PRON- get home and examine the repair -PRON- seem a little mediocrepoorly do
but -PRON- guess -PRON- be good than -PRON- be completely break
amazing mexican food with a very friendly and helpful staff
-PRON- favorite restaurant at the university of illinois
why do not anyone warn -PRON-
numerous people have tell -PRON- that this be a cool un scottsdale like scene
and -PRON- be right around the corner from where -PRON- live
so -PRON- decide to check -PRON- out one night
-PRON- be give three star base on the assumption that from a guy 's perspective this may be kind of a fun place if -PRON- be into fake boob fake tan and not the lean of dance girl
but seriously- why do not anybody warn -PRON- or just tell -PRON- about the half naked girl hang from the rafter
not -PRON- cup of tea
when -PRON- walk in -PRON- first thought be
yeah
this be different
the people be kind of biker ish and there be rock music playing
nothing wrong with that
then -PRON- notice that the girl behind the bar be wear the low cut half shirt and teeny little brief and -PRON- think to -PRON- hmm this be a bit like hooters
not totally -PRON- thing but -PRON- friend
and -PRON- go ahead and order drink
then the girl get up on the bar and start swing from the rafter hoola hoop upside down and smack -PRON- butt together at which point -PRON- be like omg what be -PRON- do here
gentleman continue enjoy as -PRON- please
ladies consider yourself warn
-PRON- have order from this location for a couple year now -PRON- never disappoint
the one time -PRON- make a mistake -PRON- go out of -PRON- way to fix -PRON- for -PRON-
driver be quick and polite
-PRON- also have a negative experience with this company and would not recommend -PRON-
-PRON- have purchase a groupon deal to use with a friend for a fun girl afternoon out
when -PRON- call the number to book -PRON- appointment -PRON- listen to a message that give -PRON- a new number to call which be -PRON- only option since the mailbox be full
-PRON- call and try to book appointment with rmt 's as the groupon deal have state that rmt 's be available and be tell that -PRON- could not book with an rmt for the next few month and -PRON- do not know when -PRON- only one would be take appointment
-PRON- be also tell that -PRON- would not be able to book two appointment at once as -PRON- only have one therapist take appointment
-PRON- try to find two that be back to back but end up not be able to book anything that work with -PRON- schedule
after -PRON- experience on the phone -PRON- be concern with the service -PRON- have just give -PRON- a bad feeling
so -PRON- go to check out the facility
-PRON- do not see the actual massage room but -PRON- can tell -PRON- honestly that the website and the facility have nothing in common
-PRON- re check the website after -PRON- visit and be a bit surprised to discover that the testimonial appear to be take from other massage website
the one that clue -PRON- in be the one from sarah who be actually review a place call apex in calgary not sure how -PRON- miss change the name and city all -PRON- do after that be search for massage therapy testimonial and -PRON- find some of the other
-PRON- end up get a refund from groupon the place just be not as advertise
have lunch here twice
-PRON- think the food be really tasty and the service be great
-PRON- be 2 saturdays in a row around lunch time
the place be empty both time but seem to have a busy takeout business
the staff be friendly and helpful
good sushi -PRON- have have yet
-PRON- be not a huge sashimi fan and usually play -PRON- safe with the roll but this restaurant be truly a divine pallet experience
-PRON- have the chef 's recommendation as well as sweet shrimp and -PRON- husband like uni
-PRON- have try uni one time before at another sushi restaurant
and -PRON- be totally repulse by -PRON-
the server urge -PRON- to try -PRON- at this restaurant
and -PRON- be amazing
everything -PRON- have be absolutely perfect
very flavorful and fresh
the only down fall be -PRON- could have eat more
-PRON- will for sure make this one be -PRON- splurge restaurant when -PRON- visit vegas
ok nothing to write home about
neighborhood website promo get -PRON- there but horrible location
need to consider move if wanna be relevant
this place be not easy to find as erin and julie have note
-PRON- share the same commercial lot with a barber shop and a midas and be hide in the area behind the barber shop http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/f6rzdgytqfjs9sqc6bv81w?select = kmbaaechfwhnwgfcihc2na
no wonder a banner over the store 's door proclaim congratulation -PRON- find -PRON-
http:\/\/static.px.yelp.com\/bphoto\/hxavt8xse-4wmbzss mjtg\/l
the store space -PRON- be small and the product be quite pricey
why the 5 star then
because -PRON- sell really good stuff
and -PRON- be understandable that gluten free baked good would be more expensive because the necessary flour need for such creation be more expensive than wheat flour and be not as readily available
also work with these alternative flour pose a challenge -PRON- experience be that most gluten free baked good tend to be dry overly dense and tasteless
but the folk at gf creations have manage to make baked good that be moist tasty and with good texture
-PRON- enjoy -PRON- bread and muffin a lot and -PRON- like -PRON- bagel good than regular wheat flour bagel
glad to know that -PRON- who try to be on a gluten free regimen have this great source for yummy baked good
-PRON- definitely be worth the effort try to find this tricky to locate store
-PRON- be update -PRON- review for dlux
when -PRON- go at the end of august -PRON- be a little peeved about -PRON- policy -PRON- only cook burger to one temperature-- medium well\/well done-- and do not allow any substitution
-PRON- come home and write a long rant about the horror of overcook meat among other thing
-PRON- just receive a response from the director of hospitality at the food fight restaurant group and -PRON- be truly impressive
-PRON- really go above and beyond to answer all of -PRON- concern
-PRON- have write -PRON- share of bad review but -PRON- have never get anything approach this in response
-PRON- would still prefer a rare burger and the risk that -PRON- entail but the folk at food fight do a great job explain why -PRON- have choose not to offer that
-PRON- also explain that -PRON- be in fact possible to make substitution
so here be the update verdict
this be a solid place
-PRON- have extremely competitive price for such a nice location
the fry be very good -PRON- try both the cheddar\/green onion combo and the truffle fries-- both be fantastic
the shake be simply out of this world-- -PRON- do not think -PRON- have ever taste a good one
however if like -PRON- -PRON- think that a great burger and a thoroughly cook burger be mutually exclusive -PRON- will not be thrill with that aspect
if on the other hand -PRON- tend to order -PRON- burger medium well or well do -PRON- will have absolutely nothing to complain about
mostly -PRON- be impressed by how sensitive management be to -PRON- complaint
-PRON- be somewhat ambivalent about food fight restaurant in general-- -PRON- tend to have great interior design and menu but sometimes fall a little short on execution--
but -PRON- certainly can not fault -PRON- when -PRON- come to -PRON- professionalism
-PRON- wish more restauranteur be as commit to customer service and satisfaction as -PRON- be
horrible experience with dr. mathieson
-PRON- come in and clearly have a strep throat and just want antibiotic
the doctor collect a culture to test for strep
but -PRON- have a strong gag reflex so the swab do not go all the way to the back of -PRON- throat
-PRON- try twice then give up
-PRON- then say -PRON- look fine just take some ibuprofen then -PRON- should be good to go
-PRON- tonsil be super inflame and have tonsil stone
-PRON- highly doubt ibuprofen would do anything
that be like put a band aid on a gunshot wound
the next day -PRON- go to a real hospital with a real doctor and -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- meet the four symptom criterion for a diagnosis of strep throat where a culture be not even need and -PRON- give -PRON- a prescription for antibiotic
-PRON- waste 20 dollar co pay at the urgent care for nothing
-PRON- tell mathieson -PRON- be in the medical field but -PRON- be still super rude and condescending
-PRON- hate do review especially bad review but this one be necessary
cherries diner be a classic diner downtown on the market square which harken back to all of the b reel diner scene -PRON- have ever see in film
this no frill joint offer solid breakfast and lunch fare at a reasonable price
the coffee be really good and the waitress keep -PRON- come
speaking of the waitress -PRON- be -PRON- favorite part of the dining experience
-PRON- be rough around the edge never smile but be not rude
no time for chit chat but make sure -PRON- want for nothing
-PRON- come across like -PRON- may actually smack -PRON- if -PRON- get out of line -PRON- get the feeling -PRON- be do this before
-PRON- be great

the small than usual to the point menu offer the standard diner fare
-PRON- go with the kitchen sink omelet make with onion green pepper ham and cheese serve with honest to god home fry and -PRON- choice of toast
the home fry be fry crispy on the outside soft on the inside with the jagged and almost burn edge perfection
the omelet be make with the ingredient cook into the egg as oppose to the egg surround -PRON- not -PRON- preferred style but still a solid omelet
the low price draw a little more of a sketchy crowd but -PRON- just add to the classic ambiance of what -PRON- may think of for a hometown diner
-PRON- would definitely go back
robert have always be precise with -PRON- alteration
everything always fit so well and get do in a timely fashion
-PRON- recommend this alteration location to everyone
-PRON- unfortunately have to go to the er at least once a month due to severe migraine
the doctor and physician assistant be quick as possible and get -PRON- the right medicine
-PRON- have rarely spend more than 2 hour here and only have a handful of bad incidence involve nurse who do not listen to -PRON- if -PRON- give -PRON- that medicine without an antinausea -PRON- will vomit
-PRON- like the quick room for non trauma which be quieter and have adjustable lighting that help during -PRON- migraine treatment much good than the room with the uncomfortable gurney
-PRON- have these rolling recliner -PRON- feel less hospitaly which be probably why -PRON- less stressful
-PRON- also limit to one visitor per bedside which be mostly adhere to so no run around kid and scream baby
the only reason -PRON- do not get five star be the time when -PRON- have have rude nurse who act like -PRON- be do some kind of charity when -PRON- be do -PRON- job and the one who decide -PRON- know -PRON- body better than -PRON- do four year of daily migraine but hey if -PRON- want to wear vomit -PRON- -PRON- choice
-PRON- also have to visit family in the regular part of the hospital once
-PRON- have never be admit to any part other than er and the waiting room be pack
child everywhere people sit on floor -PRON- be awful
there be that gross smell from just too many people in one tiny waiting room because of visit hour be so restrict
actually that part remind -PRON- of a bus station
if the walking dead be on while -PRON- be there tv 's in the quick room people seem to be in a good mood when -PRON- come in to help -PRON- or who ever -PRON- roommate be on the other side of the curtain
ps
-PRON- partner of 6 yrs take -PRON- there every time
everyone be nice helpful and -PRON- have never be ban from -PRON- bedside or treat rudely because of -PRON- sexual orientation
yep the narcissistic jerk who run this place be still there
nothing but complaint
the only reason people still use this place be -PRON- have a drive thru
when -PRON- have an issue with -PRON- nasty food -PRON- toss -PRON- out
because how dare -PRON- complain
and the shit head at -PRON- corporate office be bad
frankly -PRON- be check to see if -PRON- be publicly own
-PRON- use to work for a major brokerage house and guess who -PRON- be call tomorrow
lot and lot of broker
-PRON- call ahead about a leaky tire
-PRON- get -PRON- in right away and patch -PRON- tire for only $ 22
quick service trustworthy and -PRON- stand behind -PRON- work
-PRON- say -PRON- could come back if -PRON- have any issue with -PRON- tire patch
-PRON- have be here a few time now and twice with a deal chicken
the taco be okay if -PRON- be look for a more upscale fast food taco
the burger be delicious
all the right topping come together
one suggestion -PRON- wish -PRON- would serve a single patty burger
then -PRON- may be more likely to add fry or a shake
but after not be able to finish or truly enjoy either after eat the burger -PRON- be more likely to just get the burger in the future and call -PRON- a meal
plus -PRON- usually treat -PRON- with a burger and do not eat -PRON- regularly so one beef patty be enough to satisfy -PRON- craving
-PRON- have always come to this place for -PRON- gelato but -PRON- need to get something from the plaza
so -PRON- figure -PRON- would buy lunch here as well
-PRON- really that -PRON- give the option for full serve dine in or hot table for those that be not look to be service
-PRON- have the parmesan veal sandwich with mushroom and -PRON- really enjoy this
-PRON- be a bit messy but that be to be expect from saucy sandwich
-PRON- also have the pizza a while back
and -PRON- be good but not to -PRON- personal liking
the gelato have many different selection of flavour and the serve size be very generous so if -PRON- be look for a decent amount the small should be more than enough
first time yelp reviewer the service be that superb
extremely knowledgeable and efficient staff
very friendly
all around good people
the perfect local option
excellent delicious authentic food
large portion for a low price without sacrifice quality
recommend the meatloaf and fry chicken as well as the side
well -PRON- do not go here by choice and -PRON- would not recommend anyone go here unless -PRON- be coerce
this place be kind of suspicious from the start -PRON- be purple and pink outdated counter top and outdated decor in general set off -PRON- uh oh radar and -PRON- be not wrong
even the service be a bit questionable -PRON- be not greet for a long time after show up and have to wait for -PRON- order -PRON- say would be ready
this of course not the end of the world but the food really be
-PRON- come here for takeout for 6 people
the only good thing about this place be price $ 64 because of 10 off for pay cash and the hot and sour soup hard to screw up
while the shrimp and spicy eggplant be not bad everything else be really questionable
such as chicken ball rock
hard cold and chickenless shrimp in lobster sauce sauce be more of a disgusting gel chicken chow mein too saucy
in general the food be too cold really quickly
not sure what would have cause that -PRON- be hot and then all of the sudden totally cold
just a bonus -PRON- guess
so the moral of this review be go anywhere in china town or even manchu wok and -PRON- will be eat good chinese
terrible sandwich
stale bread dry sandwich no flavor
cashier be grumpy with a bad attitude
the bad sonic location on planet
today be the last time -PRON- ever come here
the -PRON- need new employee
now -PRON- understand after two year live by -PRON- why -PRON- husband hat to go there
-PRON- take for ever to make -PRON- food and rude customer service constantly have the long line in the world
this be one -PRON- new favorite place to have lunch
the hubby and -PRON- have be live in chandler for year now and just finally get around to explore the downtown area
this be the first restaurant in the area -PRON- go to
and -PRON- have to say -PRON- be impressed
the outside dining area be lovely
-PRON- still maintain the old western feel all while -PRON- sit outside enjoy the weather and watch the people around the downtown area
the service both time -PRON- have venture there be really good and quick
-PRON- have try one of -PRON- burger and -PRON- have to say -PRON- be really yummy
-PRON- have have some burger that be not good at all
but the burger do not disappoint
-PRON- have also try the half and half combo
-PRON- be hop for a light lunch
and -PRON- be surprised at the amount of food -PRON- get for half a sandwich and a salad
this have quickly become one of -PRON- favorite local place to grab food
doug be the service man who arrive to repair some of -PRON- household need
-PRON- be on time prompt and come prepared
-PRON- do a wonderful job on all that be request
-PRON- appreciate -PRON- down to earth explanation and courteous demeanor
thank -PRON-
the food be decent but that be if -PRON- can actually get service once seat and if -PRON- get service -PRON- come with a lot of bad attitude
-PRON- would recommend skip this place
the food be alright -PRON- really depend on where -PRON- sit in comparison to other table
by the time food get around to -PRON- there be not many piece leave and -PRON- all sort of taste the same
the spicy tuna -PRON- get be not cold but luke warm
when -PRON- get -PRON- check -PRON- have overcharge -PRON- friend by two plate
-PRON- be quick to try and fix -PRON- but the end up add the two plate to -PRON-
just a bit frustrating

go to bj 's on eastern in henderson be great food nice atmosphere
the atlantic salmon be amazing
-PRON- would recommend bj 's for all to try
not overly price either
this place be probably jumpin back in the day
-PRON- really be a shell of
-PRON- be former self
and with street construction take place around the neighborhood -PRON- will probably spend more time drive around try to get to this ghetto part of town than actually eat in this restaurant
and when the parking lot attendant attempt to charge -PRON- to park in the run down parking lot immediately do a u turn and park next door
-PRON- order a pint of the great lakes brewing company and a basket of ring
after 25 minute -PRON- inquire as to the status of -PRON- order as folk all around -PRON- be sit down order food and get -PRON- grub immediately
-PRON- guess -PRON- forget -PRON- order and within ten minute -PRON- chow show up
great onion ring love the local brew
this place be a dump
just the kind -PRON- like
when -PRON- do not get charge for parking and do not have excessive wait for service
perhaps the most entertaining aspect of -PRON- visit be keep track of the yellow jacket sting the server endure while -PRON- sit at the bar
seriously
these chick have bite all over -PRON- leg and arm
yellow jacket everywhere
-PRON- count no less than a dozen sting among the lady
as -PRON- leave -PRON- see mccartys a local irish pub and immediately wish -PRON- go there instead
be here many time and not bad
half the dealer have zero personality which can make playing card no fun at all especially if -PRON- losing
really wish -PRON- would acknowledge that and fix -PRON-
want to give -PRON- five star
but hey -PRON- be just not las vegas be -PRON-
overall not bad and if -PRON- visit just make sure to look around for a happy dealer if -PRON- can find one
good buffet -PRON- have ever experience
this will be -PRON- one stop every time -PRON- visit vegas go forward
crab leg and sushi be a must try
the street taco be super delicious and the dessert station be unbelievable
mechanical md save the day
work mostly with derek
-PRON- be last minute\/last call run into home warranty shenanigan and -PRON- show up ready to go-- tell -PRON- what the last company say have to be do fix -PRON- problem make -PRON- aware of some faulty work and misinformation-- provide -PRON- with service recommendation

-PRON- guy be -PRON- go to now
-PRON- have be eat here for 15 year
-PRON- have consistently offer yummy and authentic thai\/cambodian\/khmer food
-PRON- make the beast pad thai in cleveland hand down
the curry be good the jade noodle the soup the spring roll and mango with sticky rice all great
tonight -PRON- pick up a green papaya salad and for the first time be a bit disappointed
in fact -PRON- have so much raw garlic which -PRON- believe one can never have too much of that -PRON- could not eat -PRON-
-PRON- will try again tomorrow but that be a salad that really bite back
-PRON- also get the mekong garden a vegetable and tofu medley top with a peanut sauce
nice the vegetable be perfectly cook
but the sauce be a bit sweet for -PRON-
yum
pad thai
and do -PRON- mention the portion be huge
just stay in vegas for 7 day that be right 7 whole day in vegas and go to lou 's every single morning
-PRON- be fantastic diner food at criminally low price and a nice reminder that there be more to las vegas than the strip
the husband and wife that own the place be unbelievably friendly and will do everything -PRON- can to make -PRON- dining experience great
highly recommend the curtis stack as the biscuit and gravy be unreal
can not see -PRON- eat breakfast anywhere and highly recommend this place to anyone and everyone
if -PRON- enjoy laser tag -PRON- would recommend come here
the upside be -PRON- be a two story arena
the top be connect so team battle get a bit chaotic which be awesome
the down side be the arena be a bit small
however -PRON- would definitely come here again
the good be not big and bulky -PRON- be comfy
laser be easy and light buuuut -PRON- have to be hold with two hand
still a lot of fun
oh man
this be a life change dog
pb&jj
:-d this be a bacon wrap hotdog with jalapeno jelly
what
amazing
-PRON- have make a sandwich that be similar with ham
so good but to experience be truly enjoyable
-PRON- also try another hot dog with a spicy flavor
but -PRON- forget the name
right amount of heat and flavor
oh well -PRON- guess -PRON- have to go back to find out what -PRON- eat
highly suggest wrap -PRON- dog in bacon
yum
come in today no appointment
-PRON- break -PRON- glass 2 month shy of -PRON- insurance pair due date
clean office friendly staff
josh and -PRON- coworker be helpful pull out multiple pair of glass for -PRON- to try on
no pressure for an up sale and -PRON- be able to get one of -PRON- glass to -PRON- in an hour
the only reason -PRON- do not give -PRON- 5 star be the lack of selection for the cheap frame
although -PRON- have really nice designer one for a lot more than the sale price
this be the first quiktrip in the state of north carolina and be one of the new gen 3 station feature upgraded amenity with massive fountain drink tea and coffee station
there be also a manned soft serve station and the ability to make hot or cold drink as well
these store be about 25 large than traditional qt 's and be simply amazing
this location be brand new and ultra clean
-PRON- first time order from patty 's tamales
and -PRON- be super impressed
-PRON- live half an hour away from this place and honestly -PRON- be worth the drive get some fresh authentic tamale
first off great customer service
the cashier be very nice and helpful
the tamale be only $ 2 each very inexpensive plus -PRON- be huge in size
great deal
-PRON- favorite -PRON- try be the pork tamale red and chicken tamale red
the red sauce be tasty and have the right amount of spice to -PRON-
the green sauce be really good too but -PRON- could not handle how spicy -PRON- be
-PRON- swear to -PRON- -PRON- tongue be burn for a good ten minute off one bite
-PRON- be not a big fan of the chicken with brown sauce neither the cheese with peppers
-PRON- be alright
but overall this place be bomb
and -PRON- be definitely come back the next time
-PRON- have a tamale craving

amazing staff courteous professional
amazing location
beautifully keep
spacious for family of 2 little one
great starter home
no bug roach scorpion earwhick ant etc
neighbors mind -PRON- own
affordable
-PRON- get -PRON- monie worth
con
need security due to open community layout
shock to see any negative review
this place be great
-PRON- favorite beer be ohana and medicinal wheat -PRON- like wheat beer
the food be always delicious
all -PRON- sauce be home make bbq dressing dip etc
and everything be fresh
when -PRON- want a casual spot to grab a bite and have a couple beer this be the place because -PRON- be always good
-PRON- just decide to do -PRON- first review
-PRON- eat at this restaurant quite often and enjoy -PRON-
so -PRON- decide to check out the review
-PRON- read one review with someone complain because of the amount of food be not to satisfactory
-PRON- have to say that one of the reason -PRON- like this place be because of the large amount of food
if -PRON- leeave here hungry that -PRON- need to change -PRON- diet
even the lunch special be enough for 2 people to share
the service be awesome and the food be excellent
-PRON- can not go wrong with this place
the service here be great
-PRON- review have no reflection on how -PRON- be treat
the food -PRON- receive be a different story
-PRON- get the chicken hemingway
for $ 13.95 -PRON- get maybe a four ounce piece of chicken
rather than a nicely grill breast like the menu imply -PRON- may have be a slightly burn fatty thigh
-PRON- take small bite and -PRON- be do in three bite
this small piece of chicken be garnish with a few black bean and that be -PRON-
for a $ 14 plate for dinner -PRON- get three bite
absolutely absurd
the chef even walk up and try to crack a joke on how -PRON- be already finish while -PRON- friend be still eat
-PRON- response "did -PRON- see what -PRON- be serve
how about a legitimate portion
-PRON- just walk off
no excuse for this
-PRON- be hem and haw about give a 3 or 4 star
-PRON- would probably do a 3.5 if -PRON- could
but -PRON- think -PRON- be at least good enough to round up and not down
-PRON- have be go to this place for many year
this be -PRON- family 's favorite mexican restaurant in the area and -PRON- have be here for 20 year so when visit -PRON- would wind up here at some point
-PRON- have be several time since -PRON- have move back
this place probably be some of the good mexican that -PRON- have have in this city which -PRON- find odd that there do not seem to be as many local mexican restaurant as one would think
-PRON- can attest to the great service every time -PRON- have be here
-PRON- seem like the same girl be always work and -PRON- be super friendly and everything come out quickly
-PRON- always get a margherita when -PRON- go
and -PRON- honestly think -PRON- have one of the good around
so many time -PRON- seem like -PRON- be all mix
but here -PRON- give a heavy handed pour which always make -PRON- smile
-PRON- be huge as well as tasty
heck just write this make -PRON- want to go there after -PRON- go to the gym tonight
-PRON- have eat several thing here and always enjoy the food
-PRON- would not say that -PRON- be so great that -PRON- just crave -PRON- but then again -PRON- keep go back so -PRON- be pretty good
-PRON- have never have an overly greasy meal and get the impression that the place be fairly clean
the location be kinda remote but at least there be plenty of parking and if all else fail -PRON- can go to the gun shop next door before or after
-PRON- love that this place be locally own and operate
-PRON- be good to know that -PRON- meal have a more direct impact on the local economy
-PRON- final vote be go
if -PRON- want good food friendly service and tasty margherita then el torito cafe be the place for -PRON-
-PRON- can never go wrong with chicken and waffles
if -PRON- have not try this place then -PRON- definitely need to
do not forget to try the red blue or purple drink
-PRON- live in hawaii and brian v. have always be very responsive and professional
-PRON- can not say enough about brian v.
-PRON- property in avondale be under management by two different property management company before -PRON- find brian
when brian take over for the first time in a few year -PRON- do not suffer any property damage or loss which -PRON- attribute to brian 's ability
-PRON- recently decide to sell -PRON- avondale property and brian represent -PRON- with the sale which be sell quickly for a fair price
-PRON- highly recommend brian v and propertyaz
this place be amazing- pork green chili salad slow cook beef shoulder devil egg french dip taco and the list go on
the food be amazing
the only thing -PRON- have that have not be good be the bone marrow-
some like -PRON- but -PRON- just be not for -PRON-
in addition to the fantastic food the service and drink list have also not disappoint
this sunday -PRON- try -PRON- brunch $ 18ish for a brunch buffet with tasty bacon chicken and waffle egg and omelette by request
-PRON- also have out salad pancake french toast with banana and chocolate pork green chili pork belly hash veggie and pastry option and so much more
100 amazing just wonder how long the buffet style will last- today be the second weekend and people slowly trickle in so the buffet be not over crowd and the chef be able to keep everything hot and fresh but once word get out this place will be pack and -PRON- worry -PRON- will change the awesome setup
great little bar with good food
service be top notch from both -PRON- bartender as -PRON- come in during shift change over
-PRON- will be back next time -PRON- will have to ride -PRON- beach cruiser up
club sandwich be huge
-PRON- love this place
the portion be very generous and the food be delicious
-PRON- wife always get the grill chicken and -PRON- son ov the columbiana soda
amazing atmosphere for a pre party drink and -PRON- food be also really good
-PRON- octopus be a most try as well -PRON- pizza -PRON- be authentic neapolitan dough and very tasty
this restaurant recently open on steeles and dufferin
-PRON- be a reasonably small restaurant with very nice decor and a clean and comfortable atmosphere
there menu be extensive and so far everything -PRON- have try be really good
three dish of note be the chilli chicken basil chicken and pad thai
-PRON- also deliver in the area so -PRON- have enjoy takeout from -PRON- too
this could easily become one of -PRON- favourite restaurant in the area
after hear so many people rave about this place -PRON- have to go in and see what all the fuss be about
-PRON- order a country club sub
and -PRON- be not impressed
the sandwich be mediocre at good overloaded with mayo-
-PRON- think -PRON- could have toss together a good sandwich at home
the bread be too thick -PRON- have to pick a lot of -PRON- off just to get to the meat
-PRON- would possibly consider try another sandwich sometime but -PRON- first experience with jimmy johns do not leave -PRON- want to go back or suggest -PRON- to someone else
-PRON- wander in because -PRON- think this new location at the norterra shopping center be open to the public there be lot of car and people go in and out
-PRON- turn out to be friends and family day and this buffalo wild wings be not officially open until a few day later
-PRON- turn to leave but -PRON- tell -PRON- to come on in and make -PRON- at home which be a pleasant surprise
there be alot of hustle and bustle go on and confusion some friend and family can be pretty demand
and -PRON- think some of the new server be nervous but everyone be in a good mood happy and the service be above and beyond what be usual at some place and quite efficient
there be lot on the menu to choose from besides wing and the kid menu be extensive
-PRON- order a black and bleu burger a grill chicken sandwich cheeseburger slammer a boca burger and of course the wing
there be so many wing sauce to choose from.and -PRON- decide to try the caribbean jerk sauce
everyone be satisfied with -PRON- food and -PRON- all try each other even -PRON-
and -PRON- get the boca burger
i'm a can't resist the temptation of meat vegetarian
often boca burger serve at restaurant be not very tasty even though -PRON- be all the same brand
-PRON- do not know what buffalo wild wings do to -PRON-
but -PRON- have a goof flavor and not that cardboard texture
the black and bleu burger have an interesting flavorful combination of bleu cheese and cajun spice and the cheeseburger slider be yummy
-PRON- have get in the habit at restaurant of test out the burger without all the condiment to see if the meat actually have a good taste
-PRON- have be so disappointed at several restaurant lately where the burger be laden with extra but if -PRON- push those away and actually take a bite of the meat alone -PRON- be dull and flavorless
this be not the case at buffalo wild wings the beef be season to perfection
the chicken sandwich be juicy and have a good flavor
-PRON- really enjoy the wing as well
-PRON- hate soggy wing and these be nice and crispy
the sauce be definitely tasty and not too sweet or spicy as some jerk seasoning can be
-PRON- be surprised that the french fry taste just like mcdonald 's which be a good thing if -PRON- love -PRON-
-PRON- guess -PRON- be just expect the fry to be different
at the end of the meal -PRON- ask for the check and be tell no check -PRON- be all on the house which be a pleasant and unexpected shock
-PRON- will definitely be back
-PRON- boss tell -PRON- about this place
man

crunch burger
plus -PRON- girlfriend have the 1842 burger
-PRON- be in burger heaven
oh
-PRON- also have the duck spring roll too

-PRON- show -PRON- picture of what -PRON- be think and -PRON- be able to input -PRON- knowledge and give -PRON- exactly what -PRON- be want
-PRON- be very sociable and make -PRON- visit a wonderful experience
the salon be very cute and be great on pricing
-PRON- highly recommend bangz art hair salon

-PRON- can count on food truck friday when -PRON- be undecided about lunch
today -PRON- get there around 1:10
and -PRON- try burgers amore get -PRON- veggie burger and curly fry
the fry be just okay oilier than -PRON- would have like but the burger be fill and -PRON- like that -PRON- have the topping separate so -PRON- could customize -PRON-
other time -PRON- have go to short leash hot dogs
-PRON- use to enjoy the bear but be not feel -PRON- last time
-PRON- have yet to try other truck but the grill cheese place sound promising
as long as -PRON- be a vegetarian or seafood friendly entree -PRON- be down
-PRON- like that the location be close enough to -PRON- work that -PRON- can walk and help burn off some of the calorie
really great service and clean facility
-PRON- make the experience comfortable and be very professional
-PRON- give -PRON- option for pricing and let -PRON- choose what be right for -PRON- need
as a bonus the gentleman always open all door for -PRON-
friendly courteous and fast
will be back
so this be one of those time when -PRON- do not know if -PRON- should rate this 3 or 4
the food here be still absolutley melt in -PRON- mouth real greek food
the spicy lamb and chicken breast stuff with spinach and feta combo be outstanding
accompanied with the red greek wine egg lemon soup greek salad hot garlic toast and hot pita bread
amazing
and affordable
but here be the rub
the owner george do not remember -PRON-
that be fine
but -PRON- be the only server tonight and be totally distract all business not -PRON- old friendly chatty self that always add to the charm of this gem
-PRON- try to engage -PRON- in conversation but -PRON- want no part of -PRON-
-PRON- be not busy
there be only one other table occupy in the whole place
but maybe that be the problem
-PRON- do not understand why this place be not pack all the time
-PRON- could not ask for more authentic delectable food and great price
maybe -PRON- be the location maybe -PRON- be -PRON- attitude
but -PRON- be definitely not the food
not terrible but not the ideal airport
-PRON- be fly on a busy morning after a holiday
-PRON- take -PRON- an hour and a half from the moment -PRON- enter the door to check in go through security and get to -PRON- gate
that would be a disaster for anyone who be run late which be usually -PRON- but on this particular occasion -PRON- be hour early so -PRON- could be zen about -PRON-
lot of people freak out though
-PRON- simply do not have the capacity for the amount of flight there especially on southwest
the tsa dog be a super cute black lab
point for that
there be a good amount of place to charge -PRON- phone and -PRON- car rental experience at the airport while far away be pleasant
-PRON- would not recommend rent from there though due to the extra fee unless -PRON- have a low rate like -PRON- do
compare compare
-PRON- would fly here again -PRON- guess
eh whatev -PRON- be another stupid night club
the music be good and if -PRON- follow -PRON- on fb -PRON- can avoid the kid night and the crappy djs -PRON- hate
-PRON- be really cool inside and posh
dress sophisticated
chick get in for free at least the half dozen time i have be there but dude can expect to pay $ 20 a piece
nyny hotel famous for the replica of statue of liberty the big apple coaster and nathan 's famous hot dog
great restaurant great shop and -PRON- could not even get decent service here
-PRON- arrive there think this will be the ultimate vegas vacation
half of that be not fufill
anyways -PRON- check in walk to -PRON- room and -PRON- have to say nyny really improve and modernize everything which be nice
one day -PRON- decide to go to the pool the weather be perfect and what be a good way to cure a hangover than be at the pool and absorb some sun

turn out -PRON- be under construction
maybe -PRON- be be prissy but -PRON- feel enraged
-PRON- check out experience be horrible
this woman charge -PRON- for the full resort fee and -PRON- argue that -PRON- should not pay the full fee because the pool be not available
-PRON- then try to explain to -PRON- that -PRON- mention -PRON- when -PRON- check in and also mention that -PRON- can use the pool in certain hotel
-PRON- assume but in fact -PRON- do not tell -PRON- this during check in time
-PRON- be argue that -PRON- do
-PRON- do not even give -PRON- a discount on this stupid resort fee
-PRON- do not want to waste -PRON- time so -PRON- leave
1 star deduct for the pool 1 star deduct for bad customer service and 1 star deduct for hire this lady
oh on top of that housekeeping do not do -PRON- job
-PRON- could have handle -PRON- costumer service better but -PRON- do not so look like -PRON- will not be visit this fake big apple crap anymore
both time -PRON- have come in -PRON- never wait and service and food be perfect
-PRON- be a big restaurant and extremely clean

this come highly recommend by local as well as friend who recently attend a conference at the fairmont resort near charleston 's
-PRON- have the country fry steak and -PRON- be more quantity than quality
-PRON- for one be wear out with seemingly every restaurant use chipotle in -PRON- dish and this be the case with charleston 's country fry steak gravy which have a little kick
-PRON- have a cup of potato soup and -PRON- be excellent
friend with -PRON- have a cheeseburger and meat loaf
-PRON- one friend rave about how delicious the meatloaf be and the other say -PRON- hamburger be perfectly cook hot pink in the middle
-PRON- like the dark wood atmosphere of the restaurant and -PRON- have customer range from family with kid to senior citizen so -PRON- be clearly appeal to a mix of people
service be okay though not memorable
impressed
-PRON- seem to have get over -PRON- opening teething problem
the ayce menu seem as good -PRON- can figure only available after 5 pm
-PRON- be $ 20 + change
the sashimi feature nice thickly cut hunk of salmon
delish
-PRON- would make -PRON- 5 star but have to knock -PRON- back a star
like many ayce place what -PRON- tick off on the order sheet be not always what -PRON- get
there be an intriguing pepper salmon on the sashi section that take -PRON- two try to get to the table
have to order octopus twice to get -PRON- to the table
big up for the pepper salmon however
the outside of rub with some pepper the outside be quickly braise ahi tuna style and then slice
and why have not -PRON- be in here yet
this could be -PRON- second or third review
but -PRON- do not care
-PRON- love this place
the food be so good -PRON- know -PRON- just open
but -PRON- feel like this place should be burst at the seam with people
-PRON- initially try this place bc of groupon and trust -PRON-
-PRON- be so happy that -PRON- do
-PRON- love the service the chef owner but the food be 5 star -PRON- friend say the chilaquille be as good as -PRON- mom -PRON- will have to take -PRON- word for -PRON-
this be the first time -PRON- have ever have -PRON- but
the crab and prawn benedict
-PRON- be delicious good
-PRON- have ever have
-PRON- have have a lot of bennie in -PRON- life but this be a memorable one
the season potato be a must
perfect execute the hollandaise be fresh and not too thin or thick the english muffin be perfectly toast and the crab and prawn patty be all meat everything well season with a perfectly poach egg and some avocado to tie -PRON- all well this be a dish that will bring -PRON- back
so -PRON- be think that -PRON- need to go work here maybe make the place a little more lively and then at 5 a.m. -PRON- get a barista name emily omgosh

-PRON- come with a biscuit n a salad
the rib be moist and tasty as for the chicken -PRON- think -PRON- be a bit over fry but -PRON- be juicy
the mac n cheese be not not to -PRON- liking
-PRON- be bland
-PRON- friend order the 2 piece of chicken come with mash potato n gravy
the meal be nicely present on a cut wood board
-PRON- definitely recommend this spot for a date or simply to enjoy good food
-PRON- will not break -PRON- wallet
-PRON- will definitely be go back soon
after read all of the good review -PRON- be disappointed in what -PRON- get
-PRON- know sometimes -PRON- get -PRON- authentic food and then most other time -PRON- get -PRON- fusion cuisine
thai senses be a fusion thai restaurant
1
shrimp tom yum soup be too salty
there be an overload of fish sauce flavouring
at the level 2 spice there be way too much mince lemongrass and mince pepper
-PRON- be choke on the residue from every spoon of soup

lamb burger be outright bad(tast off and char
-PRON- share and together only eat half
the filet be decent but not $ 25 worth of decent
waiter be kind and the ambience be romantic but at the end of the day the food just be not that good
there be lot of great byo 's in the city and in -PRON- opinion this be not one of -PRON-
-PRON- find a cool pipe with the hammer and sickle on the side unfortunatley -PRON- come with a free piece of metal jam hard into the stem
-PRON- take -PRON- to thomas hinds and the buddy there while understandably look at -PRON- like what the fuck do -PRON- do to this pipe immediately take out -PRON- tool kit and try to fix -PRON- for free
as -PRON- expect the pipe be too far go and after about 5 minute of delicate work the mouthpiece break and the guy apologize
this be -PRON- last resort
and -PRON- figure -PRON- would happen anyways
-PRON- hook -PRON- up with a pipe repairman in quebec there be none in toronto or ontario for that matter give -PRON- all -PRON- contact info
-PRON- do not even buy anything
but -PRON- sure will when that pipe be all fix up
these guy be awesome
first time visit great food
small and quaint
friendly service
-PRON- have a large party and -PRON- split check easily
go in on a whim to eat with -PRON- sister
have an awesome dining experience until -PRON- notice partially cook chicken in -PRON- pad thai follow by the sight of a cockroach on the toothpick at the bar
needless to say -PRON- have have food poisoning for the last few day
bad customer service in existence
-PRON- be kinda funny to see this in this day and age
but if of do not mind the attitude the food be good
well there be a new sheriff for comfort food in town where the big boy eat
that be the restaurant 's slogan and for good reason
dinner portion here be large and come with an individual bread loaf to pick and tear at dip in gravy or spread with the sweet butter provide as one please
and -PRON- single serving of chocolate cake order a la mode come with two large scoop of vanilla ice cream and be humongous enough to feed and satisfy the dessert craving of -PRON- entire party of four
the cake be moist and be one of those rarity that taste as good as -PRON- look in the display case
but -PRON- be get ahead of -PRON-
let -PRON- start at the beginning
when -PRON- arrive -PRON- will be greet in the convenient parking lot in front of the restaurant by a paul bunyanesque ax wield lumberjack
not to worry
this greeter be friendly and freeze in paint cement
once inside the restaurant be bright and invite although a light over -PRON- table be burn out
there be a few other opening week glitch as well
although -PRON- server be very friendly and well mean -PRON- take a long time to order after receive menu and -PRON- have to request water twice before any arrive
but by the end of -PRON- meal staffer be replenish iced tea without be ask and frequently check on -PRON- party 's need
-PRON- be skeptical about the quality and variety of food -PRON- would find here after read one low rat review
but -PRON- vow to keep an open mind as -PRON- go through the front door and become a believer as soon as -PRON- taste -PRON- cup of chicken noodle soup which be the soup of the day
-PRON- sport some vegetable and thick noodle and feature shockingly very hot and tasty broth
a choice of soup of the day or one trip to the salad bar as well as a choice of potato rice or mixed vegetable come with dinner entree like -PRON- ground round dinner which be basically a hamburger steak
but a very good hamburger steak weigh about half a pound and cover by hot and tasty brown gravy
-PRON- be able to order -PRON- as -PRON- like
although -PRON- ask for medium rare not too surprisingly the meat be actually cook medium
this be still good than the well do hamburger one get at most restaurant nowadays especially in clark county where the health department really put down the hammer on doneness of hamburger product
all be well on the plate except the temperature of the gravy cover mound of mash potato be tepid at best
the masher be good but should be heat more before be serve
-PRON- be less than half as hot as the meat serve on the same plate
because -PRON- wife be a veggie hater -PRON- be able to enjoy the salad bar 's offering too
as -PRON- do at first -PRON- be grumble to -PRON- about the one trip rule
but -PRON- mood quickly brighten upon see the size of the wooden salad bowl provide
-PRON- be large
anyone who have learn how to pack a lot of food into one bowl at a mongolian barbecue restaurant will fare just fine here on one salad bar visit
plus the entree and sandwich be large enough that gluttony be not advisable at the salad bar
one trip should be plenty
fresh produce and other salad bar offering be fairly standard although with a couple of striking omission
while there be an abundance of white mushrooms strand of beet large red grape tomatoes piece of crunchy celery red onion black olives crouton shredded cheese bacon crumble something akin to sunflower seed and a variety of salad dressing to go with the iceberg lettuce provide miss for -PRON- be potato salad tuna salad garbanzo beans piece of ham and egg
because many of these item can be find at the garden salad bar of ruby tuesday just next door -PRON- would not go to lumberjacks just for -PRON- salad bar unless -PRON- add some more item
in fairness though lumberjacks also offer several specialty salad that look interesting
the homemade bread serve with entree be doughy but light at the same time
all food -PRON- taste include a bite of diane 's chicken fried steak be of high quality than typical coffee shop fare
-PRON- think lumberjacks be a winner and fill a long empty niche for high quality breakfast and comfort food in north las vegas
-PRON- be already a fan and look forward to return soon and try several more lumberjack menu offering
buy a car there
-PRON- salesman scott collins be great
-PRON- be very knowledgeable be all aspect about all the car -PRON- look at
-PRON- work very diligently to make the deal work to for what -PRON- be look for and want
all staff be friendly and make -PRON- feel welcome and general manager also welcome -PRON- as -PRON- come into the dealership
jorge the finance manager also do a great job with all the final paperwork and explain different option -PRON- could take advantage of to help -PRON- in -PRON- car purchase.and -PRON- be very friendly
the dealership be beautiful when -PRON- walk into -PRON-
everything be state of the art and very modern and very clean
the service area look very nice and give -PRON- many option to do while -PRON- wait on -PRON- car .i.e.- put range golf
-PRON- wife and -PRON- be also very impressed as -PRON- have a starbucks coffee machine doughnut and other food and drink -PRON- have
overall -PRON- would highly recommend this dealership when look for a honda
-PRON- genuinely like this place at first
-PRON- go in during a time that be not so busy and really get a feel for the atmosphere and the food
the quality of the food be standard for a breakfast place -PRON- can say that -PRON- be nothing special
the decor be old and have a very run down feel to -PRON- not necessarily a retro feel more like an overused vcr
yet there be something about this place that -PRON- like
the cook genuinely know what -PRON- be do with the technique -PRON- use and the way the food be handle like a skilled barber
then today -PRON- go in hop to get something quick during -PRON- hour lunch
-PRON- wake in and find a handful of people eat -PRON- meal
the moment -PRON- walk in -PRON- could hear a harsh tone and pungent voice speak to the cook -PRON- have to do thing quicker stop mess up the order
-PRON- casually sit down and the same person that be talk to the cook approach -PRON- with a completely change demeanor
for the next 30 minute -PRON- witness this woman who turn out to own the restaurant speak to -PRON- staff in the most heart retch derogatory manner
this cook brush off -PRON- comment with charm and pose -PRON- would just whistle and cook the food diplomatically
customer service be not just the immediate interaction with pay customer
-PRON- personally believe the way staff be treat make a world of a difference in the success of the business
-PRON- can understand that serve people may be a very challenging line of work but if this person can talk to -PRON- staff in front of customer the way -PRON- do then there be no way -PRON- will be eat here anymore
-PRON- get hose at kennedys
-PRON- recently change manager and -PRON- can say there be a big difference
-PRON- go to the all -PRON- can eat crab leg night
in the 45 minute -PRON- be there -PRON- only receive one order of leg
-PRON- be ignore most of the time and the current manager insult -PRON-
when -PRON- refuse to pay the manager call the police
-PRON- can honestly say -PRON- have never be treat so poorly by an establishment
service be lack but the food be okay
-PRON- would not be see frequently here for sure
-PRON- go with a guy who be from out of town -PRON- be not a high roller -PRON- have a wonderful time the lap dance -PRON- seem to enjoy the drink be cheap and the girl bartender be great this be good value really be would tell -PRON- friend to go when -PRON- be from out of town and want a not so expensive nite on the town marcella
-PRON- sister and -PRON- eat here for dinner and leave with nothing but a five star experience from the food to the service
-PRON- start with a caprese salad which be very good
-PRON- enjoy a pork chop that be cook to perfection with a side of delicious veggie and amazing mash potato
-PRON- two year old have the grill chicken with veggie and the fresh fruit ever off the kid menu
-PRON- also order lasagna to go for the hubby which -PRON- think be absolutely delicious as well
can not wait to bring the family back
someone need to tell burgatory that salad usually have lettuce in -PRON-
order the grace salad what i get be a whole sliced up tomato with some onion and goat cheese on top
burger be pretty damn good though but a bit small than imagine
-PRON- have never be to the location in south end even though -PRON- have drive through there plenty of time on -PRON- way to the nail shop in the same complex
but recently -PRON- have to be at the mecklenburg county courthouse for various thing and since the close parking garage be the one by this cluck n cup -PRON- stop in to get a quick bite and to validate -PRON- parking ticket
-PRON- like -PRON- something about the big glass window and sun shin in make -PRON- very peaceful
-PRON- first visit -PRON- end up do work here arm with an ipad free wifi and remote log in
-PRON- go to breakfast item be -PRON- breakfast sandwish with ham egg cheese on toast croissant $ 3.99
fabulous
-PRON- regular coffee be good too not the watery kind but have a good robust taste to -PRON-
-PRON- also serve lunch and be open on weekend
quite honestly -PRON- price be very reasonable for be uptown
p.s. remember the parking validation be only good for 90 minute $ 3 worth
-PRON- have be run some very stressful difficult errand all day long and have not have time to eat since 4 a.m. and now -PRON- be 3:30pm
-PRON- look around and realize that -PRON- need something more substantial than fast food
-PRON- spy this texas roadhouse as -PRON- be zip up stapley and -PRON- rumble tummy scream -PRON- want steak
-PRON- hustle -PRON- bustle into this country and western theme steakhouse and be seat right away
-PRON- be surprised that the place be about 80 full of customer at this time of the afternoon but soon figure out why
-PRON- have early bird special for $ 8.99 serve 3pm-6pm monday friday
-PRON- respond to the cry of -PRON- rowdy tummy and order the 6 ounce sirloin steak with a salad sweet potato and soft warm white roll with cinnamon butter
the roll be awesome and the salad be a surprise -PRON- be very large for a dinner salad and include egg and cheese as well as the lettuce red cabbage crouton and tomato
the sweet potato be perfect with butter and brown sugar on the side
the steak look more like 8 ounce instead of 6 ounce be flavorful and tender -PRON- be expect a shoe leather consistency at this price point
the steak be grill perfectly to -PRON- desire level of doneness
the server be excellent and check back several time during the meal to see if -PRON- need anything
parking be plentiful and close to the door
overall an extremely excellent value for the money with the bonus of tasty food and great service
-PRON- will be back
have a burger once
and -PRON- think -PRON- taste a little dry
since -PRON- husband do not eat beef -PRON- be a bit disappointed -PRON- do not have a turkey burger or a veggie burger or some other option
the service be friendly here
and the cajun fries
-PRON- have actually come in twice and get a medium order of cajun fries to go and take -PRON- home in the brown paper bag and enjoy -PRON- with whatever -PRON- be have for dinner that evening at home
-PRON- realize five guys have become really popular but for a straight up burger -PRON- still like the in n out double double protein style
what a great array of quality affordable service this company offer
-PRON- have use -PRON- for over two year now for inside and outside project from a shed tear down to repair of -PRON- slide glass door to a leak in -PRON- kitchen sink
not only be -PRON- quick to respond quick to compete the job polite and good at clean up after -PRON- but -PRON- be always at the good price -PRON- find anywhere
-PRON- think what -PRON- like most about linda and -PRON- team what make -PRON- really stand out be that -PRON- be just plain helpful and as concerned about -PRON- bottom line as -PRON- own
-PRON- have call -PRON- several time to say this be what be happen
what do -PRON- think -PRON- be
and -PRON- will say -PRON- be probably this or that
try this and see if -PRON- work
if not call -PRON- back
-PRON- could just as easily have say -PRON- will come over and charge -PRON- $
x
but -PRON- do not and do not
that be nice
-PRON- own a small business too and -PRON- know that for every 19 nice customer there be bind to be one or two that -PRON- can not please no matter how much -PRON- stand on -PRON- head for -PRON-
and -PRON- be often the folk who vent -PRON- spleen unreasonably on these review site
so -PRON- think -PRON- only right to take the time to tell -PRON- how great this company be
-PRON- thoroughly recommend arizona 's mr. fixit to any metro phoenix business or individual
as usual look for a nice sit down at the time of night that -PRON- should be finish dinner but -PRON- would think that for vegas that would not be so hard but -PRON- be
thankfully -PRON- be get a meal on the mgm
so -PRON- have to go to a restaurant own by the mgm
craftsteak be the restaurant of choice
service be okay
but do not really like be seat in the area that look like -PRON- be the bar lounge as oppose to be seat in the actual restaurant
the table for some reason make -PRON- feel like -PRON- be sit mile away from each other but -PRON- be just a round table strange
menu be a bit weird but -PRON- order fine enough with the waitress help
food be good but do not like the fact that the steak come in this skillet that be place on a plate that be not flat
try easily cut a steak when the surface be not sturdy not nice
asparagus be good and the wine be complimentary
-PRON- do not rush -PRON- out which be nice
but -PRON- be too tired to stay anyway
nice restaurant good food good service but for some reason
not sure -PRON- would come back
not the great vibe -PRON- guess
update aug 2013 -PRON- make this review get a response from a manager reply to -PRON- and then nothing more
-PRON- forget about -PRON- as -PRON- do not matter to -PRON- anymore
a few month later -PRON- get a call from a woman manager who say -PRON- apologize -PRON- do not see that -PRON- have reply to another manager 's comment to -PRON- original 1-star review

-PRON- husband drop off -PRON- cowboy boot on friday for repair to the heel

nielsen 's frozen custard be -PRON- new favorite treat
-PRON- have not the slight clue why there be not more nielsen 's frozen custards or any other frozen custard joint around
and why not in hawaii where -PRON- be warm almost all year long
why be regular ice cream and yogurt parlor so much more popular
frozen custard be where -PRON- be at
-PRON- really can not begin to express the amount of joy one cup of nielsen 's frozen custard bring -PRON-
-PRON- be in love with -PRON- rich flavor and -PRON- smooth thick and creamy texture
-PRON- seriously can not get enough of -PRON-
just like the movie
as far as the ambience go -PRON- be reminiscent of a 1930s ice cream parlor
very cute with that authentic old fashioned vibe
like in the movie
hah
fresh
at nielsen 's frozen custard -PRON- claim to make the frozen custard fresh daily with no preservative and no artificial ingredient
woohoo
none of that synthetic mysterious freak show stuff here
make with eggs
yes yes yes
nielsen 's frozen custard be make with egg
sound weird but -PRON- be really not
the egg be what allow for the extra smooth creamy texture that frozen custard be know for
there be not enough egg put into the recipe to where the frozen custard taste eggy
also frozen custard have less air content than other ice cream which account for -PRON- thick and heavy consistency
-PRON- can totally feel and taste the difference
3 flavors yield
a plethora of option
as for the flavor of the custard -PRON- only offer 3 vanilla chocolate and flavor of the day
the vanilla be decadent and creamy beyond belief
these basic flavor be the gateway to a bunch of other flavor profile or what -PRON- like to call concretes
concrete be the extra thick version of a shake make to be eat with a spoon
-PRON- be a magical blend of either vanilla or chocolate frozen custard and one or a few topping
-PRON- favorite out of the one -PRON- try be oreo
the lemon be also good
verdict
if -PRON- have the money for -PRON- -PRON- would fly back and forth to vegas just for some nielsen 's frozen custard
so if -PRON- have get an insatiable sweet tooth like -PRON- and -PRON- love -PRON- ice cream creamy nielsen 's be the place to go
yelp 365 281\/365

all three have rave review
s have a bloody mary and -PRON- have a sangria while wait
s say the bloody mary be good
-PRON- sangria be white wine and taste all peachy\/mango ish
sorry but that be not sangria
price be spot on and staff be friendly and efficient
-PRON- will definitely go back when -PRON- be in pittsburgh
this be stop number 2 on -PRON- little kierland commons adventure
-PRON- be in awe of how beautiful the strip be
the perfectly landscape street soft string lighting -PRON- be truly stunning
bar north have an invite feel to -PRON- decor

-PRON- server come out to greet -PRON- in a timely manner
-PRON- be kind knowledgable and check on -PRON- regularly throughout -PRON- stay
-PRON- order a margarita which be awesome
-PRON- be make with just the right amount of sweetness
-PRON- and -PRON- company be enthral in each other 's company and the cozy patio that -PRON- decide to stay for a snack
-PRON- order the chef 's board which be a beautiful display of meat cheese pepper nut asparagus bread olive and a magnificent jam
-PRON- leave not a crumb for a mouse
well do bar north
-PRON- will definitely be back
mediocre food
nothing special
-PRON- enjoy flavor 's buffet at harrah 's much more
and -PRON- cost a little less also
-PRON- find the food to be over price for the quality -PRON- receive
-PRON- be nothing to write home about in service either
overall very mediocre food -PRON- have try a few different menu item from salad to steak without much satisfaction
one positive be there be an outdoor seating area which be nice when the weather be warm
well let -PRON- just start with -PRON- book ahead of time during the week for -PRON- husband 's 40th birthday
which be something -PRON- be really look forward to
go to vegas to celebrate sound like a great idea at a time
-PRON- guess -PRON- should have do more research on the hotel
first off -PRON- be way to family kid run around everywhere make an adult feel weird about drink in front of kid
second the check in -PRON- be super duper long and move slow like -PRON- be the themepark
third the front desk clerk do not really know anything and have to call to see what be go on then proceed to tell -PRON- that there would be an additional $ 50 a day charge plus $ 20 daily resort fee on the spa room that -PRON- book which be fine for deposit but daily deposit on the same room that -PRON- staying in for a consistent number of day -PRON- just do not understand that
the part that make -PRON- upset be -PRON- do not mention any of this online
so instantly -PRON- feel like -PRON- be get rip off
-PRON- think hidden fee be just wrong
-PRON- be sorry people should know what -PRON- be look forward to spend ahead of time and not throw for a loop when -PRON- get there
so then -PRON- ask -PRON- husband let -PRON- just be sure and ask the lady at guest service -PRON- go on to tell -PRON- in a very nasty way
oh -PRON- should have charge
-PRON- will
$ 100 a night deposit for the spa suite
-PRON- look at -PRON- and say well -PRON- all should list these price and fee on -PRON- website and not trick people once -PRON- get to -PRON- hotel for -PRON- stay
but anyway -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- no longer honor the birthday comp or coupon -PRON- offer on -PRON- site so -PRON- be kind of feel down about that but be like oh well
the buffet which -PRON- really look forward to go to be very overrate this be in -PRON- hotel
way too pricey for the little bit of stuff -PRON- offer and -PRON- be self service
in the morning the housekeeper knock then just enter the room
so if -PRON- be unclothe or indecent -PRON- just barge in
the cocktail waitress never come back if u happen to see -PRON- -PRON- have to run -PRON- down for one
which when some people be gamble
-PRON- be kind of nice to not have to chase a drink down
the room -PRON- be okay kinda date the jacuzzi tub be the only good point for -PRON-
-PRON- be usually pretty open and easy when -PRON- come to review thing
but this be very disappointing which be sad for -PRON- because -PRON- birthday be ruin
service be just terrible
-PRON- check out early and go to a different place
but all in all -PRON- will never stay there again
-PRON- stay for one saturday night
that be probably the appropriate amount of time to stay because -PRON- never really do feel settle in
the people at the front desk be nice but be almost try too hard to sound american if -PRON- know what -PRON- mean
the hostel have -PRON- own bar with decently price beer £ 2 for a tiger and a good breakfast complete with haggi
-PRON- also have laundry facility on site
-PRON- cost £ 1 for the dryer which do not sound bad but -PRON- need to put -PRON- clothe through twice to get -PRON- dry and -PRON- be not even a quarter full
-PRON- only put in what -PRON- be wear as -PRON- have get soak in the rain
also -PRON- be really loud outside on a saturday night
overally -PRON- be good enough especially for the cheap price
the wait staff here be very friendly however slow to get service
-PRON- may just be under staffed
-PRON- order wing here on wing night and -PRON- take 40 minute to get -PRON- to the table so long -PRON- end up have to get -PRON- to go since -PRON- run out of time before -PRON- next event
-PRON- be with a group and the one strange thing that happen be that -PRON- want to order a sub but the waitress ask -PRON- for a credit card for a tab a tab when order food
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- would be pay cash and could -PRON- still order when -PRON- pay with cash
-PRON- seem frustrated but ultimately take -PRON- order weird
anyway -PRON- be a big place but if -PRON- go here do not plan for quick service
take -PRON- time play some darts or pool and chill
oh yea -PRON- smell a little strange in this place
-PRON- will not notice after a few minute but when -PRON- first walk in -PRON- will get a musty greasy smell meh
-PRON- will not keep -PRON- from come back
-PRON- do not buy anything from there
the store clerk just suggest some product and give -PRON- free sample so -PRON- would not waste -PRON- money
definitely come back
-PRON- do not expect to like this place
any place that use hype as a marketing tool turn -PRON- off and -PRON- do not even want to stand in line for a great restaurant
that say as a young child about 4 year old -PRON- distinctly remember thinking-- when -PRON- be a grown up and can do whatev -PRON- want -PRON- be go to pour a glass of pancake syrup and drink -PRON- and -PRON- be not think about pure grade b maple syrup from the dcfm
-PRON- be think about the store brand aunt jemima that -PRON- mom buy
while -PRON- have never actually follow through on that fantasy the urge behind -PRON- remain
sugar bomb
bring -PRON- on
so go here with one of the kid during a packer 's playoff game to make sure there be no line no line
barely any car on the road and get a 6-pack of donut
some be traditional fry donut the rest be chocolate cake donut all with massive amount of various frosting and topping
-PRON- eat one for dessert well half of two different one
-PRON- could have eat another but know -PRON- would only make the impending oh man why do -PRON- eat that
-PRON- should have eat 1\/4 of one thought even strong and compel -PRON- to eat salad for lunch the next two day instead of one
the kid of course give this place 5 star these be 100 time good than the donut -PRON- get at swim meet
so do the responsible adult thing
go to bloom
get a dozen to feed the kid after a birthday sleepover
go here
cute environment and pastry setup
-PRON- wish -PRON- could grab a box of macaroon every week from here
but -PRON- be pretty much a thousand mile away haha
pistachio macaroon be -PRON- ultimate fave
this place be very cosy
the service be wonderful the dish be tasty but be still lack the delicious part of the meal
-PRON- have an oyster deal at the time
but -PRON- be not a huge fan of oyster
so -PRON- do miss out on those
-PRON- would give the service a 5 out of 5
very attentive and courteous
-PRON- be a must try destination if -PRON- be into -PRON- oyster
as -PRON- only try a couple of the dish in which -PRON- have the snow crab leg but be quite disappointed in the size
other than that -PRON- be happy overall
firstly -PRON- japanese name be xu wok gee so -PRON- be very offend by this restaurant 's name
the only hot pot in this restaurant be the one the chef must have be smoke in the back
the pickle cabbage be too sour and the vermicelli undercooked
the portion be also so big that -PRON- have to pack the food as hard as -PRON- pack heat
all in all -PRON- daniel wok gee xu do feel like -PRON- be fuk
and -PRON- will be come back for more ^ddddddddd
stan be extremely helpful and quite enjoyable to talk to
so -PRON- will definitely go again when project call for great tile specification
3.5 star one of -PRON- go to place for cheap decent sushi
-PRON- actually above decent
but -PRON- have see the quality go down from the past few year
-PRON- have not be there for dinner so this review be mainly for the lunch ayce menu
for 11.99 -PRON- get a decent selection of roll kitchen item and sushi the food be ok but the service be below standard -PRON- seem to be rush -PRON- out everything -PRON- decide to eat there
this be why -PRON- do not get 4 star
-PRON- have hear and read a few article on this place prior to -PRON- come in to check -PRON- out
when -PRON- first go -PRON- be about 1:00am
and -PRON- be on -PRON- lunch break as -PRON- work graveyard for a company just down the street
-PRON- be look forward to get -PRON- hand on these donut but find that the entrance be lock
-PRON- double check and verify that the place be open 24 hour
not sure what happen
but -PRON- walk away feel dejected
-PRON- send a private message via facebook to pink box and get a reply a few hour later
-PRON- apologize no one be available when -PRON- come by and offer a free donut which be really nice of -PRON-
-PRON- try again a couple day later and this time -PRON- be able to get in
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- be -PRON- first time visit and -PRON- take a moment to walk -PRON- through -PRON- doughnut selection
-PRON- wind up get a half dozen of -PRON- gourmet doughnut
the nutty pig and cronuts be -PRON- favorite there
-PRON- be a small place just big enough to handle a few people in line
however there be table just outside in front where -PRON- can sit and eat
-PRON- only have regular coffee and hot chocolate available for hot drink milk and juice for the cold drink
although there be a couple more donut shop for -PRON- to check out here in vegas this one be -PRON- favorite for now
-PRON- decide to try this place for a to go salad for dinner
-PRON- order the california protein cobb and -PRON- be so good
-PRON- do not realize the person think -PRON- only want a half order
-PRON- guess people usually get salad soup and a sandwich so next time -PRON- will clarify -PRON- want a full salad
the cheesecake be pretty good -PRON- can have berry add but -PRON- get -PRON- plain
-PRON- also have a phone charge area that look pretty interesting
-PRON- be very trendy and the employee be all super friendly
-PRON- be definitely go to eat in and bring -PRON- boyfriend here next time -PRON- be in town
everytime -PRON- come in this place there be either one or two people work which make everything slow -PRON- be still wait on -PRON- food after be here for more than 25 minute on an hour lunch
and the cashier kristen take -PRON- order receive -PRON- money but unfortunately be not able to give back change correctly and have to ask for help on which -PRON- help have to use a calculator on -PRON- phone in order to know the difference of $ 11.33 from $ 15 in addition to have to get a refund on -PRON- bowl because -PRON- never get -PRON- -PRON- refund be issue in a gift card for -PRON- bowl and with 2 minute to spare
-PRON- have to go back to work hungry and unsatisfi very poor costumer service indeed
this place be awesome great service and very fast
-PRON- want to try something out side of the casino for breakfast
will definitely be go back again on -PRON- next visit

-PRON- would give -PRON- 5 star for -PRON- wonderful peaceful mural and four star for -PRON- good price
however the food -PRON- be pretty average and taste somewhere in the region of three star quality

-PRON- use to travel to the state to get wing at buffalo wild wings because of there mango habenero sauce and sadly -PRON- think -PRON- be go to have to continue do that because the service be unbearable at this location -PRON- would imagine be a sport bar -PRON- would make sure the beer never run low but -PRON- and 2 friend have to ask the bartender for another round and take 10 minute to get -PRON- drink in the first place
-PRON- can not lie
-PRON- sometime have no choice but to go there because of the wing -PRON- have even complain to district
guess no one care
gord and -PRON- have some errand to run this morning
so -PRON- decide to have breakfast out
drive along queen street w -PRON- pass the sister and then park
-PRON- would hear good thing about -PRON-
-PRON- sit at the table by the window
gord order fish cakes and eggs with a side of bacon
-PRON- order the p.l.t. minus the lettuce
-PRON- both notice that the potato be really really salty and way overloaded with herb
gord try to scrape off the peeling and eat the inside
-PRON- try dunk -PRON- in ketchup
-PRON- both end up leave most of -PRON-
gord say -PRON- fish cake be okay and find the bacon too salty
-PRON- say the good part be the egg and toast
-PRON- sandwich be just okay
-PRON- could not taste any mustard or garlic mayo
the bottom bun be really really soggy
so -PRON- end up just eat the peameal bacon
-PRON- server scott be very friendly and take good care of -PRON-
-PRON- do not enjoy the food though so will not be back for brunch
oddly enough -PRON- have be to cherryblossom load of time in the past
how -PRON- have not review -PRON- be beyond -PRON-
but that be neither here nor there
-PRON- return to cherryblossom for a first date last night and be remind why this be such a great place
-PRON- share the gyoza which adam have not ever have before
serve in a sizzle pan -PRON- be wonderful and perfectly portion for two people
-PRON- order the hot thai beef salad which -PRON- apparently order every time -PRON- come here -PRON- have the cold zaru soba

-PRON- try adam 's beef and -PRON- be deliciously tender
can not wait to come back
marty 's cycle remind -PRON- of the bike store -PRON- go to as a kid
personal and helpful unlike the walmarts\/costco 's of the world
-PRON- sell a quality product at a fair price
-PRON- can get a cheap bike at a discount store but in -PRON- experience -PRON- will not last
quality
tdcanadatrust close a bank account -PRON- have have with -PRON- since -PRON- be 12 year old 26 year due to 60 day inactivity -PRON- be not -PRON- primary account and without any warning or notification
no letter no phone call and no notification that -PRON- have do so until -PRON- discover -PRON- have just terminate the account after -PRON- go into this tdcanadatrust branch
-PRON- absolutely refuse to re open the account even after -PRON- plead with this branch manager
unbelievable actually
complete customer service fail
-PRON- find -PRON- a real head scratcher as to why -PRON- would treat -PRON- long term customer like this
do not -PRON- realize -PRON- be internet and social medium
friendly\/savvy some of -PRON- very active and vocal
-PRON- have over draft protection on the account
that be close another joint account with -PRON- and even a 3rd account a $ 179,000 line of credit
because of this ridiculous and ignorant decision -PRON- very likely will be pull all -PRON- business and take -PRON- to another financial institution all together
-PRON- also sell real estate full time in toronto and the gta for -PRON- living and will definitely not be send -PRON- any future mortgage business not that -PRON- do much with tdcanadatrust anyway as -PRON- mortgage rate -PRON- offer always seem to be one of the high rate quote when -PRON- buyer shop for a mortgage rate
why would -PRON- want -PRON- client subject to this lack of customer service
-PRON- definitely leave this branch not a happy camper
several day later -PRON- call the branch no less than 4 time throughout the day
always get a voice message say that -PRON- call could not be answer but that someone would get back to -PRON- by 6 p.m. that day
-PRON- end up leave 3 voice message over the course of two day
and -PRON- never do get -PRON- phone call return from this branch after simply state -PRON- name and phone number and politely request a call back
customerservicefail brutal
moon valley nurseries save the day for -PRON-
-PRON- originally buy eighteen shrub and two tree for -PRON- backyard and be incredibly impressed with how quickly -PRON- be deliver and plant
after a hot summer the shrub be not look so great so lp one of the arborist come by and assess the condition of the plant give -PRON- suggestion and idea listen to -PRON- concern patiently and always speak to -PRON- in a professional sincere manner
-PRON- be very impressed with lp and due to the way -PRON- handle this situation -PRON- will work with moon valley again
really cheap but tasty 5 7 $ small plate like grill cheese salad burger taco and empanada include a huge vegetarian menu get a starter if -PRON- be really starve otherwise a plate and a drink will suffice
casual but sharp decor think armchair and funky wallpaper
decent drink price
often pack around dinner time
so -PRON- may have to wait a few minute
but -PRON- be worth -PRON-
try the loaded ceasar or a signature cocktail if -PRON- be look for something different
-PRON- want to first say that -PRON- absolutely love bosa donut -PRON- be so excited to have one so close to home
-PRON- have try -PRON- five time now
so -PRON- feel like -PRON- have give -PRON- a lot of chance and each time be more disappointing than the last
-PRON- do not have the donut selection like other bosa donut place once -PRON- run out of glaze
the people who work range from be rude to be completely confused on what be go on
-PRON- hope this place be become good
-PRON- love the fillmore
-PRON- be between 4 and 5 star and
the reason -PRON- go with 4 star be because -PRON- pay $ 18 on wednesday night for two bud lights
and -PRON- think that be ridiculous
and -PRON- be not a fan of the vip seating -PRON- have on the second level for the willie nelson concert
-PRON- take up way too much room make the venue feel a little overcrowded
these seat be not there for the black crowes or five for fighting
and -PRON- prefer -PRON- not to be there the next time -PRON- be lucky enough to take in a show here
the bathroom be great here which be an add bonus and a surprise
this venue be fantastic for those who love to get up close and for those who want a more intimate setting for a show
really willie be spectacular
and -PRON- love the small venue for such a big man
-PRON- make -PRON- nearly impossible to think of go to a coliseum\/arena event
show often sell out so buy ticket early
-PRON- should have read the review before send -PRON- husband here for -PRON- son to get a haicut
-PRON- say specifically 2 on the side 3 on top
-PRON- come out too short and the girl seem like -PRON- do not know what -PRON- be do
-PRON- son 's haircut be so terrible that -PRON- husband have to tell the girl to just cut 1 on -PRON- son whole head
can not recommend this place -PRON- be a new graduate just learn to cut and seem like use u as a practice
-PRON- be in a good location and work well enough as a cafe
-PRON- share -PRON- location with a wine bar that start serve in the afternoon
-PRON- would make a pretty good date location
depend on who -PRON- get at the counter service can be either stellar or almost laughable
-PRON- never leave review
that should tell -PRON- something right there
-PRON- work in sale and -PRON- experience with this company help remind -PRON- of what not to do
donna come for measurement and consultation
from the beginning -PRON- come off like -PRON- be not really interested in -PRON- idea or -PRON- business
-PRON- spend very little time ask any question or provide feedback on what -PRON- want
this be -PRON- first time own a home
honestly blind and drape be the least of -PRON- concern but -PRON- want to get -PRON- do and do right
-PRON- make decent money so if -PRON- see value in something -PRON- will pull the trigger
no quote
no estimate
no package plan be ever send to -PRON-
there be no follow up from -PRON-
-PRON- have already finish work with budget blinds in mesa by the time -PRON- decide to reach out to this company and let -PRON- know -PRON- be still wait for -PRON- quote
the delayed response be -PRON- send -PRON- a quote
no apology
no verification
there be no quote
business must be really good for -PRON- that -PRON- can just ignore potential client so readily
-PRON- work for a large mortgage company base in scottsdale with lot of home owner
-PRON- will make sure to detour every person -PRON- know from use this company
the food be alright but nothing really stand out
-PRON- have the spicy miso which be zero spicy and a handful of the small bite appetizer
nothing be bad but again nothing be really good
the waitstaff be really annoying and -PRON- do not really have just one waiter
there be about 4 or 5 different people that constantly check on -PRON- table each bring us\/refill -PRON- water without ask
usually this be something -PRON- be for but at one point -PRON- have 12 glass of water for 6 people at -PRON- table
instead of take away the empty cup the random waiter just continue to fill -PRON-
this be also one of those place that do not write -PRON- order down and -PRON- attempt to memorize everything
some place do -PRON- well however this be not one of those place
-PRON- have to remind -PRON- waitress a handful of time about miss item that -PRON- forget to put in and -PRON- bring -PRON- wrong food twice
-PRON- have eat here about five time usually on sunday afternoon
this be definitely one of the top mexican restaurant -PRON- have be to
inside be decorate in the typical bright southwestern color of a mexican restaurant
what set this place above other be the friendly staff fast service and comfortable atmosphere
locate in a strip mall in a quiet part of town -PRON- be easy to overlook this gem of a place
huge menu and variety
would definitely not recommend -PRON-
-PRON- make several mistake on -PRON- invoice which cause the insurance not to cover -PRON- and refuse to correct -PRON-
-PRON- have to pay -PRON- out of pocket due to -PRON- refusal to correct -PRON- invoice which have a lot of inaccuracy on -PRON-
when contact -PRON- be mean about -PRON-
-PRON- daughter -PRON- come here after workout and order 2 wellness drink green grape green apple pineapple orange lime wheat grass kale spinach collard green ginger flax seed agave so good refreshing
loaded antioxidant chiller green grape blueberry blackberry agave nectar order by -PRON- daughter 's friend taste like grape delicious not very sweet which be good
location be convenient

just find out have loyalty card buy 10 smoothie get the 11th free
a dollar off if -PRON- check in with yelp
not a bad deal
awesome awesomeness
the food be to die for
-PRON- be from sacramento
ca so when i find this restaurant pass by -PRON- fall in love with the food and the service be the good never be treat so well the waiter be so polite and have such a passion for -PRON- job that guy deserve a raise -PRON- be part of the reason -PRON- will be back next time -PRON- be in towy and oh the owner be also there that night and man be -PRON- so kind
-PRON- actually come out to ask -PRON- how the food and service be and shake everybody 's hand at the table such good hospitality
-PRON- feel like royalty in that restaurant and do not let -PRON- get start on the decor absolutely beautiful and so clean not a spec of dirt
-PRON- dust on the table
even the floor be sparkle clean
-PRON- could literally see reflection on the floor no lie
5 star all the way -PRON- would give more if -PRON- could
-PRON- definitely recommend this place
-PRON- have complete all 3 room at this location
at the time of this post
-PRON- be poseidon sherlock and atelophobia
poseidon the air conditioner be not work properly
the staff kindly agree to give -PRON- 90 minute rather than 60 because -PRON- be only a group of 2
-PRON- be happy with that however at 45 minute -PRON- be pretty much begging for the game to be over
sweating bullet
-PRON- be extremely experienced with escape game and there be way way too many puzzle in this room
there be no way on earth that 2 people could accomplish this room in 60 minute
instructions be a bit unclear but the room look cool in layout
-PRON- come across a suitcase that open about an inch but be lock shut
-PRON- be unclear if -PRON- be suppose to remove the paper in the briefcase from the large gap
-PRON- call to get clarification
and -PRON- turn out the paper be not mean to be remove until the lock be off
stuff like this just be not acceptable
-PRON- should not have to question whether -PRON- be cheat or not
sherlock this be -PRON- favorite of the room
the game have a small technical flaw though
even if -PRON- have the final puzzle solve correctly with the chess piece there be a possibility the surprise will not happen if one of the chess piece be just a couple millimeter off of where -PRON- be suppose to be place
this can easily be fix and have not happen yet
guy drop -PRON- an email
and -PRON- will give -PRON- -PRON- suggestion for a simple fix atelophobia -PRON- least favorite room
not very scary
there be a ridiculous part of this game towards the end that involve a live actor in the room
-PRON- be a bit insulting and annoying
this part of the room should be redesign to eliminate the live actor
-PRON- can easily choose a plastic egg out of a bin -PRON- without the help of someone else
one bad habit -PRON- have be not appreciate some of the awesome business that be surprisingly close to where -PRON- live
this be one of -PRON-
-PRON- have know mothership coffee roasters as a great place for coffee and pastry for a while now but only occasionally have -PRON- visit -PRON- to enjoy -PRON- product
-PRON- be able to rectify that issue twice recently
-PRON- offer free coffee and sample size cookie on -PRON- recent 1st anniversary celebration which finally entice -PRON- back
when -PRON- ask for the nitro cold brew -PRON- offer -PRON- a choice of -PRON- hop nitro cold brew ~$3.50 normally instead with a guarantee that -PRON- could swap -PRON- for the normal one if -PRON- do not like -PRON-
turn out that -PRON- do not feel any need to take -PRON- up on that offer
-PRON- be a strong coffee with flavor strongly reminiscent of beer
get the caffeine kick with the ale flavor be such a fun combination and the sweet chocolate chip rye cookie with a touch of salt pair perfectly
-PRON- return today to grab some fuel on the way to work
-PRON- get the hop cold brew again as well as a blackberry correct thank beth orange and almond scone $ 4 and a fresh quiche with chorizo onion and gruyere ~$5
the scone be a great representative of the cream scone variety with that soft moist dough surround with a slightly crispy exterior
the orange may not be in -PRON- flavor wheelhouse but the overall mild sweetness and tartness plus the crunchy almond work
-PRON- almost make -PRON- not miss the scone from 346 patisserie all that much
as for the quiche -PRON- be pretty greedy and choose to have at at room temperature but the texture and flavor still mostly shin through
fluffy egg and a reasonably flaky crust be what -PRON- want and this one have -PRON-
-PRON- be not too greasy either
-PRON- will have to come back soon for something
that -PRON- can get re warm mothership be a great destination for coffee
yes if -PRON- like the kind of goody that -PRON- offer -PRON- should visit even if -PRON- be clear across town
-PRON- do not even have that obstacle in the way so -PRON- do not have that excuse for not enjoy this local gem
update 6\/20\/16
croissant chocolate twist be very comparable to the one at baguette cafe
that be -PRON- cherry pie have a flaky crust burst with not too sweet dark cherry compote and -PRON- may be -PRON- new favorite
well aside from the chocolate chip rye cookies which be prepare with chocolate dough today
first off the idea alone be genius alcohol infuse cupcake
-PRON- have purchase -PRON- by the dozen for any event -PRON- have go on where -PRON- can be incorporate
so many flavor -PRON- be all delicious
-PRON- fav be the lemon drop strawberry scandal
as far as the pricing go -PRON- figure -PRON- spend 14 buck on 1 drink at a bar incorporate the cost of liquor in a cupcake good of both world
not impressed
the shrimp cobb salad have almost nothing but lettuce for 18.00
-PRON- can go to wendy 's and get a good salad
the chicken be ehh
okay and the corn bread
be at least three day old
not do this again
the price rating be because of the price and the potion
-PRON- preffer target great land to some other super center because -PRON- be clean the employee seem more helpful and -PRON- do not feel like -PRON- go to rob while shop
-PRON- have never have brace before but -PRON- make -PRON- really easy and comfortable for -PRON-
-PRON- payment plan in house be great -PRON- do not have to put anything down -PRON- be only $ 100 a month for -PRON- and -PRON- start next month
so -PRON- really be a breeze
-PRON- put -PRON- brace on right then and there
-PRON- staff be cool -PRON- have monthly theme which be kinda funny
the environment be not stressful at all -PRON- front desk girl be nice and friendly and the orthodontist -PRON- be pretty lay back
-PRON- have a blast with the ortho director or whatev -PRON- be -PRON- be really funny
-PRON- would recommend -PRON- to anybody
-PRON- even get lose on -PRON- way to -PRON- and one of the front desk girl go outside to flag -PRON- down lol
-PRON- be not a typical office environment
-PRON- have a lot of fun
pretty solid burger
fry look dinky but be crispy and flavorful
free refill
and normal fast food price
all that consider -PRON- be in an airport and that equal 5-star
-PRON- walk in to this home depot try to solve a difficult problem for -PRON- mother in law who suffer from parkinson 's and -PRON- be have a hard time until -PRON- meet the manager aurora jones

-PRON- keep -PRON- for -PRON- until -PRON- come back in town the next time and remember -PRON-
great little spot
chompie 's know how to do new york style deli
this authentic and local chain be family run and be great for breakfast lunch dinner coffee dessert and even cater
the price be right and unless -PRON- be compete for weekend brunch seating -PRON- can usually sit down pretty quickly
even then if -PRON- be willing to sit at the bar or a high top -PRON- can beat the brunch rush
the breakfast be not just a breakfast
-PRON- be breakfast all day which mean breakfast at night be completely acceptable
-PRON- favorite simple breakfast be the two egg breakfast though on weekday from 6 11 am -PRON- can get the eggcit two egg full breakfast for only $ 5.99
-PRON- favorite dish be chompie 's mile high sandwich usually the hot corned beef or pastrami
while -PRON- can never eat more than a half sandwich the full sandwich make great leftover
the black and white cookie be always a special treat at the bakery
in fact if -PRON- order anything to go from the bakery -PRON- can check in on yelp and get a free large black and white cookie
yum
also -PRON- may remember chompie 's for be feature on man v. food when adam attempt to beat the ultimate slider challenge which spoiler alert
prove even too tough for -PRON-
there be location around the valley and -PRON- be all very similar
why sell groupon when -PRON- do not have hour to accommodate people who have job and also no appoint available for 3 week
what a scam
order the double double burger which be delicious as always
this location be particularly busy yet the service be still fast friendly and very professional
will definitely be back if in the area
-PRON- experience with this company have to do with a series of unfortunate event
to begin with -PRON- give -PRON- -PRON- ipod touch on a -PRON-
would when -PRON- need a new charger port
-PRON- do not keep that item in stock and only order part on tuesdays and thursdays
ok no big deal
saturday roll around and -PRON- call to say that -PRON- lead tech the only person who could do this job be out due to a family emergency
understandable
-PRON- say -PRON- would be back the following week and could replace -PRON- then
-PRON- wait
no news
eventually after -PRON- have try check in a few time -PRON- call ask for -PRON- apple id so -PRON- can backup -PRON- datum because music and video be not work
but -PRON- think update -PRON- will help
ok -PRON- give -PRON- to -PRON-
then again -PRON- get nothing for a while but eventually -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- have to order a new part
bc -PRON- think the one -PRON- get be break
-PRON- order another one
and another one
by this point about three week have go by
-PRON- finally call again say that -PRON- ipods mainframe or motherboard or whatev be also damage and -PRON- advice that -PRON- buy a replacement
-PRON- tell -PRON- that -PRON- can use a majority of -PRON- $ 90 payment to go towards a new ipod which -PRON- will find for -PRON-
-PRON- would have prefer to get a refund and buy a new one -PRON- but -PRON- refund maximum be only $ 40
so -PRON- decide to use -PRON-
but -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- would like to spend no more than another $ 100 on one if possible
another week go by before -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- find one for $ 225 but be 16 gb whereas -PRON- be 32
in the meantime -PRON- have find a website that sell use one for around the price -PRON- want
so -PRON- ask -PRON- to look into buy -PRON- from there
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- will try and that -PRON- will get back to -PRON-
another two week pass before -PRON- lose -PRON- patient and call to see what be go on with -PRON- ipod
apparently -PRON- could not make a deal with that company and instead put another ipod -PRON- find in the awaiting -PRON- approval stage without ever have even contact -PRON- about -PRON-
the man -PRON- be talk to apologiz but not in a way that show that -PRON- and -PRON- company be at fault
-PRON- be mad but more than that -PRON- just want -PRON- ipod back
so -PRON- agree to pay for the one -PRON- find
when -PRON- go in to pay on that monday because -PRON- have call on a saturday
-PRON- let -PRON- take -PRON- old ipod back
-PRON- work fairly well besides not be able to play music\/video and not charge on certain dock
-PRON- notice the home button be stick down funny but pay -PRON- no attention
in a few day though somehow the side of -PRON- screen be stick out and if -PRON- press -PRON- down -PRON- act as if -PRON- be the home button
this cause -PRON- to constantly be stick on siris screen whom -PRON- can not talk to because -PRON- mic do not work
luckily -PRON- will understand in a second when -PRON- go in to get -PRON- new ipod -PRON- fix -PRON- for -PRON- right away
but very soon after -PRON- home button no longer work
-PRON- now have to use the assistive touch that apple luckily have
-PRON- new ipod be in great condition but -PRON- delete -PRON- backup
-PRON- do not understand why -PRON- would have because -PRON- would have be simple to check if -PRON- need -PRON- backup if -PRON- still have -PRON- device which of course -PRON- do
overall the reason -PRON- be not happy with this company be -PRON- customer service
have that not be such an issue
-PRON- could have get -PRON- new device much quicker and have be much more satisfied
this be the lame place -PRON- have ever be
and -PRON- be not even cool
-PRON- always come here late to get ice cream and -PRON- be usually great
but tonight at 10:30 -PRON- be -PRON- walk into the thrifty ice cream area to see no one behind the counter but a handwritten sign that say no cream for u
then someone walk in from outside smoking to say that -PRON- could not have the ice cream -PRON- do not know why though
-PRON- would not budge either
-PRON- think -PRON- guy be open til atleast 12
wtf
-PRON- wife and -PRON- love -PRON- backyard paver
tom be great to work with and knowledgeable
the crew do a great job and clean up as -PRON- go
-PRON- highly recommend -PRON-
-PRON- bring -PRON- car in to have -PRON- road ready service
-PRON- include oil change alignment and tire rotation
within the hour -PRON- call -PRON- and tell -PRON- that two of the tire be wear out and -PRON- need to be replace
-PRON- know -PRON- be bad
so -PRON- agree
2 hour later -PRON- arrive to pick up the car
and -PRON- be still in piece on the lift
the young man at the desk ask if -PRON- have receive a call from -PRON- about the brake and -PRON- have not
-PRON- then proceed to tell and show -PRON- that the rear brake pad be very worn the rotor also need to be replace because if -PRON- turn -PRON- -PRON- would be to thin and be below spec and then -PRON- tell -PRON- the big problem that the caliper be freeze
-PRON- quote -PRON- a price of the entire job as 1000.00 dollar
horrified
-PRON- ask -PRON- to put the car back together and -PRON- would get a second opinion
-PRON- then make -PRON- sound that the car be dangerous to drive and also that if -PRON- could find another garage to do a brake job for less then -PRON- would match -PRON-
-PRON- do find another garage with a very high customer rating
-PRON- do not mention to -PRON- the visit with sears
-PRON- quote -PRON- a price of 228.00 for brake pad and turn the rotor
rotors that -PRON- say have never be turn and even after turn would have plenty of meat leave on -PRON-
-PRON- ask -PRON- if the caliper need to be replace and -PRON- explain to -PRON- that -PRON- would see uneven wear on the pad if one of the caliper be freeze
there be no sign of any problem with the caliper
-PRON- do not know if sears service department be incompetent or just plain liar but -PRON- will never go to -PRON- again
-PRON- husband and -PRON- just buy the equinox and love -PRON-

i be just expect a filipino food fix but this place really bring -PRON- home
authentic taste and -PRON- not -PRON- usual cafeteria tasting dish
-PRON- be really tasty despite the ground ambience of plastic spoon fork and plate
this must be the go to place for every filipino in az that s need some manila glimpse
the moment -PRON- enter -PRON- will be treat like any other filipino
-PRON- awesome
for awhile i really feel i be in the philippine
99 cent store
or be it
well -PRON- be sure unless -PRON- be live under a rock or in a mansion for the past 10 or so year -PRON- have make -PRON- way into a 99 cent store at some point in time
these 99 cents only store be amazing
-PRON- can find so many incredible deal in here
when -PRON- stop in on monday -PRON- get a package of golden oreos the normal size package like with 45 oreo no -PRON- be not shit -PRON- for 99 cent
-PRON- also get on previous visit lunchables ham&swiss for life for 99 cent

-PRON- get produce -PRON- get balloon -PRON- get scour pad -PRON- get soy sauce
-PRON- can not fit all the amazing stuff -PRON- sell in here
ok so why the 3 star
-PRON- be not foolin -PRON- 99 cent only
cuz -PRON- actually 99.999999 cent which make -PRON- a dollar
that mean for every 99 item i buy
-PRON- be be rip off one
-PRON- be ok though because -PRON- save alot of money
another reason for the 3 star be because -PRON- get to date check some of the stuff
the oreo -PRON- buy be amazing and still 3 month leave till code but some of the soda and vitamin water could be out of code a few day from the day -PRON- buy -PRON-
and lastly the store be not the clean store -PRON- will shop at but honestly -PRON- can look past -PRON- because -PRON- be really busy and some of the shopper and -PRON- dam kid be very messy
so that s -PRON- take on 99 cent only
stop in and be surprised at what -PRON- will find
ps
try and spend under 10 $
-PRON- dare ya
:p
stale donut hole 14 for 2.49
this winchells be connect to a subway
get the breakfast $ 3.00 combo and -PRON- would not even let -PRON- upgrade to a bottled water which -PRON- be most accustomed to back in california
really -PRON- could not charge -PRON- the extra .25 like other subways -PRON- be willing to pay
-PRON- figure since these two store be connect there by the same ownership
-PRON- give -PRON- 2 star because -PRON- get -PRON- sandwich and donut in one place but allow for upgrade please
-PRON- be ok if -PRON- do not
-PRON- be sure -PRON- will not be back
-PRON- choose the parador because -PRON- seem to offer character within walking distance of the subway
-PRON- be not disappoint
the property really look like a museum from pittsburgh 's guild age and stay there add such a great dimension to the overall experience of visit this most underrated city
-PRON- stay in the birds of paradise room where -PRON- have a great night of sleep
no road noise in a beautiful atmosphere
breakfast be also great with french toast make out of a bread with a caramel bottom stand out
the staff be also great
dee the cleaning lady show -PRON- other room and be clearly and justifiably proud of the place
location be also great as the river front museum and stadium be nearby as be the subway less than 10 minute walk and provide free fare into downtown
after hour check in be a breeze
-PRON- have an amazing time stay at the parador and visit pittsburgh so -PRON- look forward to come back to -PRON- regional home base
love the stuff chicken breast
great drink too
one of -PRON- favorite spot for cocktail
a little pricy but over all great place
-PRON- walk up to the counter and place -PRON- order
-PRON- feature delicious souvlaki and a basic assortment of other combo of greek origin
-PRON- combo all feature an abundant order of rice or french fry delicious
for the light eater -PRON- have a nice horiatiki but the feta be grate -PRON- much prefer -PRON- in chunk
the service be fast and cheerful and all item be prepared while -PRON- wait
-PRON- number will be call and -PRON- can dive into -PRON- order
-PRON- be open fairly late so for -PRON- -PRON- a good place to go for a late nosh
reliable tasty and garlicky tzaziki
what else do one need
-PRON- be go to be honest the tour be good the tour guide be funny and a joy to listen to
-PRON- start -PRON- day for a coffee stop the trossachs woolen mills -PRON- can see -PRON- review on that then -PRON- be off to the glen coe pass a beautiful expanse of the highland with a bloody history
-PRON- stop for lunch in onich at the onich hotel also review then off to fort augstus for a cruise on the loch ness review
and once those be out of the way -PRON- stop shortly to look and photograph the massive ben nevis
the only problem -PRON- feel be that -PRON- be rush especially toward the end of the tour when -PRON- be suppose to have the option to have dinner in the town of pitlochry and instead -PRON- only have 30 minute
the day tour be suppose to last from 8 a.m. 8 p.m. and -PRON- arrive back in edinburgh at 7.15pm
-PRON- do not know if the guide have something good to do that evening but as soon as -PRON- be out of the van -PRON- be outta there like -PRON- be on fire
-PRON- would do another tour with this company to compare -PRON- and -PRON- would make sure to maybe pick -PRON- out with more time in the place -PRON- stop at
food be fine
service be super slow
if -PRON- order chicken teriyaki -PRON- be only chicken
nothing else
period

the both of -PRON- and -PRON- other roommate tell -PRON- about -PRON- situation with rent and besart tell -PRON- take out a loan would be the bad option

-PRON- do not know about this store until -PRON- go to the other one at the meadows mall yesterday
-PRON- like this set up compare to the meadows location though
before this store come along this be one of those white elephant not last very long as any one store
hopefully this do well here in the busy side of the mall
this brand marry both classic and trendy style together for a fashionable look appeal to woman or man in -PRON- 20 's and 30 's
but -PRON- also may see teen and 40-somethings in here too
-PRON- would descibe -PRON- as the go to for basic in cotton fabric
the setup be clothing from top to bottom of the store space but -PRON- do not feel claustrophobic though

great place quick to accommodate
-PRON- be new to the area
so -PRON- take first personal available john who be amazing
highly recommend this place and that masseuse
very average noodle place in the eaton 's center food court
come here for lunch last week
-PRON- have have the raman here as well as pho
-PRON- be not really anything special but convient if -PRON- be at the eaton 's food court
hunter 's pizza be one of -PRON- favourite restaurant
-PRON- enjoy the environment
-PRON- be extremely homey and cozy
the customer service at this location be great
the price of the food be pretty reasonable for the amount of food -PRON- receive
for example with the chicken soulvaki -PRON- receive a huge amount of greek salad and bread with a big portion of rice potato and chicken
-PRON- think snakes and lattes need to open a big location
+ wait time be long
when -PRON- be there summer thankfully -PRON- reserve and then go down the street for a bite to eat
-PRON- do hold the table for -PRON- for a little longer- plus point
+ the basement get minus point
snake and lattes be very cool but the basement be boring
+ the drink and pastry -PRON- try be very good if not a bit expensive
+ -PRON- eventually do move upstairs where -PRON- thoroughly enjoy -PRON-
staff be knowledgeable about game and in help -PRON- find the one -PRON- want
+ -PRON- would recommend that -PRON- go here because -PRON- really be an awesome spot
however make sure -PRON- come armed with patience because the wait can be long and -PRON- feel that -PRON- be just too busy to make this a regular hangout place
the staff here be so fabulous to -PRON- kitty
that be a huge part in pick a place for -PRON- animal someone -PRON- trust with -PRON- well be whether -PRON- be there or not
the vet have great follow up with patient
-PRON- be also technologically advanced which -PRON- like a bunch
-PRON- new favorite pizza place
-PRON- make -PRON- so happy that -PRON- use a 140 year old sourdough starter for -PRON- pizza dough
this be exceptionally hard to come across especially for a pizza
the crust come out perfectly
-PRON- have the scarborough fair which be -PRON- signature pizza and for a reason because the topping be on point
-PRON- be keep -PRON- real here
in summary come with good company to slurp some noodle and eat some takoyaki but do not expect amazing service
-PRON- have visit this restaurant a handful of time and have generally eat some pretty delicious bowl of raman give a craving and proximity to campus
even -PRON- parent a pair of tough critic mention how fragrant the soup -PRON- have the spicy miso and tanaka be and enjoy the texture of the noodle
despite -PRON- mom 's soup be a little salty -PRON- mom ask for some hot water and be pleasantly greet by a salt free broth instead
-PRON- have the tempura raman which be satisfy and extremely savory
one of -PRON- bowl be forget about so -PRON- have to ask someone on the waitstaff -PRON- always seem that the waitstaff be kind of disoriented and not particularly attentive to customer in regard to check in on meal or fill up on water unless ask hence the one star deduction
the service here at state farm be phenomenal
the staff be all very friendly and get set up with car and life insurance be super fast and easy
-PRON- highly recommend this company to anyone need car or life insurance
-PRON- also offer a good student discount which be very beneficial for college student like -PRON-
in addition -PRON- family and -PRON- save money switch to state farm from another insurance company
wow where do -PRON- begin with how incredibly bad this lease company be
first off for three year -PRON- live in one of the quad on clifton boulevard
the ad -PRON- have for this 4 suiter on -PRON- website be just lie
-PRON- be not the perfect location as -PRON- be right on the major intersection of w.117th and clifton blvd -PRON- be always noisy due to heavy traffic the alarm always go off at the cvs across the street and the background train noise
there be always car accident at the intersection and -PRON- be frustrating try to get out of -PRON- driveway to merge onto clifton blvd during the morning and evening rush
now a supermarket be be build at that intersection -PRON- be go to be pure chaos
speak of the driveway -PRON- be pot holes paradise
-PRON- be talk small swimming pool size hole that jack up -PRON- car tire
-PRON- refuse to fix the pothole and just keep fill -PRON- with rock and dirt
what a joke
as for the quad structure -PRON- the building be literally rot away
-PRON- husband once lean on one of the outside wall and -PRON- move
like the whole side of the wall move
-PRON- whole balcony area be rot away as well as -PRON- neighbor too and -PRON- fix be to just paint the floor and patch some area how about fix the railing so -PRON- will not give way if -PRON- son lean on -PRON-
speaking of paint -PRON- use the flat thin cheap paint -PRON- can possibly find
the whole place be the sickeningly cheap white paint color which stain and smudge easily
-PRON- bathroom window ledge be rot away since -PRON- be right in the shower
so -PRON- come out and re apply a coat of the cheap paint and -PRON- chip off and rot away again
the kitchen cabinet and bathroom be extremely depressing and outdated chip and just fall apart and
oh my god that place stay dusty
-PRON- be just impossible to keep clean
-PRON- hate when lease company use the cheap paint -PRON- can find just so -PRON- can charge -PRON- for any smudge or stain at move out which -PRON- can not legally do by the way as -PRON- be not consider beyond normal wear and tear
-PRON- move into this place because -PRON- need to move into a new place quickly otherwise
there be no way -PRON- would have settle here
martin be the bad -PRON- will tell -PRON- one thing and then turn around and completely tell -PRON- a different story
-PRON- deliberately withhold information from -PRON- and quite frankly -PRON- do not think -PRON- care
look at all the terrible review -PRON- get on google
also -PRON- be tell -PRON- key deposit would be process on august 31st
-PRON- email -PRON- on september 11th to see why -PRON- have not receive the check yet

when -PRON- finally receive the check a couple of day later -PRON- be date for september 12th
not august 31st which -PRON- claim
why lie

these suite be not large as -PRON- claim but extremely narrow which make -PRON- near impossible to get furniture in the floor be awful crown molding be all white which just get dusty and dirty by just look at -PRON- -PRON- have no faux fireplace in -PRON- unit all of the balcony be crumble the surface lot be full of pothole and -PRON- be locate on the absolute noisy and busy street in lakewood
-PRON- kitchen be not update that be a total lie in -PRON- ad
the flooring in the kitchen be cheap -PRON- cabinet be old chipped and white which just get dirty all the time
cabinet handle break off easily over time and the white sink collect hard water stain all the time
in -PRON- new apartment -PRON- have brand new beautiful oak cabinet with a stainless steel double sink and update countertop no comparison to the outdated mess -PRON- have at the winwood suite
needless to say -PRON- be so glad -PRON- family be now out of that winwood place
-PRON- will tell -PRON- winwood 's rent for this property be really cheap for the area but -PRON- most certainly get what -PRON- pay for
-PRON- first experience with pout and -PRON- be awesome

the apartment be well lay out and reasonably price
-PRON- 3 star rating be more for the fact that the wall be very thin
-PRON- live on the top floor and still hear -PRON- neighbor below -PRON- constantly
and -PRON- can hear almost everything from the apartment next to -PRON-
-PRON- neighbor below be an exception -PRON- be just loud and inconsiderate of other people
also -PRON- would suggest not live next to the pool -PRON- get quite loud there as well
all around -PRON- a nice property just be sure to lock -PRON- vehicle and take anything valuable out of -PRON-
so impressed by there outstanding customer service

-PRON- be worry -PRON- dog would not like the food -PRON- bring
could not believe -PRON- -PRON- say -PRON- have sample pack

felt so at home glad -PRON- go
-PRON- can add to the negative comment of previous reviewer this guy seem to make up ups policy about what package be accept
though when -PRON- point out that -PRON- have a prepaid ups label that would entitle -PRON- equally to call for the package to be pick up -PRON- say -PRON- be not ups and that -PRON- should call for a pick up instead of drop -PRON- package off at -PRON- ups store
on second thought probably a good thing -PRON- do not leave -PRON- package with -PRON-
-PRON- even call the people pay for the delivery afterwards and -PRON- be shock to hear about the service

great price and friendly people be always work and excite to greet -PRON- and -PRON- dog
yay fan for life
have there cupcake for -PRON- brother in law 's wedding last year
and -PRON- be delicious
also try there bar which be very good as well
so on the recommendation of -PRON- mother in law decide to use -PRON- for -PRON- own wedding this past week
since -PRON- do advertise on -PRON- website -PRON- do full size cake and special event
-PRON- coordinate with angela the owner via email telephone and text message at least a month before the event send picture of design -PRON- like and even decide on a flavor right away
-PRON- mother in law be excite since this be -PRON- favorite bakery and even pay for the cake talk with angela directly on the phone in the week lead up to -PRON- wedding
angela say -PRON- would deliver the cake since -PRON- shop be currently close for relocation
this be where -PRON- get messy angela say -PRON- would deliver the cake at 1:30 since the ceremony start at 3:00
by 1:30 no cake
-PRON- mother in law give angela a call to check in and -PRON- tell -PRON- that -PRON- delivery person be not answer -PRON- phone
well another hour go by and angela be not answer -PRON- phone
finally -PRON- mother in law get a hold of -PRON- and angela make up some story that -PRON- delivery person be no where to be find and the cake and other item -PRON- order be unsalvageable and -PRON- could have another cake ready by 2 hour but not the flavor -PRON- want
what bs -PRON- forget about -PRON- wedding cake
and angela lie about -PRON-
luckily -PRON- the bride be unaware of what be happen but -PRON- mother in law as livid
angela deliver the cake -PRON- after 3 p.m. when the professional photographer be already go
also the frosting be miss in some area and obviously look rush
the top tier be lemon flavor which -PRON- order and bottom tier be white cake
-PRON- cover the cake in extra flower -PRON- have to cover the bad frosting job
how embarrassing
the only good thing be the cake be very delicious and angela refund -PRON- money
but how unprofessional to forget about an event and then lie about -PRON-
so in all there product be yummy but do not depend on -PRON- for any special event
the summerlicious menu be good
-PRON- husband and -PRON- think the good choice be the fry artichoke appetizer the pork jowl main and the chocolate mousse
-PRON- also have the game meatball fish main and the panna cotta which -PRON- do not think be nearly as good as the first set of dish -PRON- list
however -PRON- be about $ 74 after tax and tip for two people
honestly could be way good if -PRON- just add some new app to the menu
add spice to -PRON- meat
less watery
-PRON- be to generic to actually enjoy
-PRON- have be have shellac manicure every two week for well over 5 year with out incident
-PRON- have three gel manicure at the ten spot and after the third manicure
-PRON- nail start to disintegrate
-PRON- have the gel remove and -PRON- nail be destroy
-PRON- can actually see large patch of red on each nail which be -PRON- nail bed show through what little be leave of -PRON- nail
-PRON- will take many month to recover from this
-PRON- wish -PRON- have pay attention to the negative review
-PRON- be also outrageously expensive
take -PRON- nail elsewhere
come in for henna can not wait to come back
the artwork in -PRON- hand be beautiful and i will be come un for threading and tinting when i grow -PRON- brow out some more
thank u
fantastic find for -PRON- today
happen across this little place walk inside and lunch life have be change forever
the place be not much to look at but the food
oh man be -PRON- ever good
do not expect -PRON- average taste mexcian burrito though the one -PRON- sell here have a flavourful kick of spice in -PRON- mouth
the size of the burrito be huge
jumbo mean jumbo and only for 8 buck too
because -PRON- be a huge rotti fan -PRON- could not help but to also get a butter chicken rotti think -PRON- will save -PRON- for dinner
the rotti -PRON- get be huge fit a large take out box and smell so good -PRON- of course could not wait until dinner to go to town on this bad boy
chicken be juicy and tender and the potato melt in ur mouth
needless to say -PRON- will b go back quite often for lunch from now on
love this place
-PRON- have be here a couple of time over the year and -PRON- have never disappoint
the arancini di riso appetizer stuff eggplant entree filet mignon entree and duck entree be all amazing
-PRON- have also have the lemon cheesecake and creme brulee
and -PRON- be also amazing
the cheesecake be more fluffy then dense which be a nice change
highly recommend this place
-PRON- be so surprised at how rude the bouncer be that -PRON- do not even know what to say
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- perfectly valid id be expire and -PRON- can not accept -PRON-
the bouncer be completely ignorant because arizona license do not expire until -PRON- be 65
-PRON- do not want to surround -PRON- with moron so -PRON- friend and -PRON- who be dress to impress that night will not be return
typical snottsdale wanna be vegas nightclub
why do bar owner think -PRON- have to be exclusive in order to turn a profit
the bowling here be pretty good and if -PRON- want to be transport into the early 90 's by dance music from a live dj this be -PRON- place for cosmic bowl on a saturday night
-PRON- probably would not come here if -PRON- be bear after 1995 on a saturday night because -PRON- would not recognize any of the music
but if -PRON- be old than 30 and have some disposable income why not bowl here
this be now -PRON- favorite cafe
music be nice nice decor
people work here be very friendly
-PRON- get greentea raindrop scarlet
ice tea
everything be so good -PRON- will be back
-PRON- husband and -PRON- just have lunch there
have few korean friend and have eat in many korean restaurant -PRON- have have experience many great korean dish
today -PRON- just want to try a new place
and -PRON- find makoto on yelp
with positive review
go there -PRON- order beef bulgogi -PRON- husband vegetable and shrimp tempura
in -PRON- bulgogi there be little beef
very greasy
very little rice and above all -PRON- be tasteless no flavour
in -PRON- husband 's tempura there be only three shrimp and the rest be sweet potato tempura or something like that
bad experience and if -PRON- be read to go there
do not bother and try a different place
excellent choice on a saturday night and even with the jazz f go on the service be great
yes -PRON- be slow but the place be pack due to the festival
alex
the bartender be very good and be do a great job with the drink
-PRON- food arrive crab ravioli -PRON- be delicious with a mountain of crab on top
very enthusiastic employee great service
-PRON- appreciate smashburger for have gluten free bun
-PRON- personal smashburger ketchup be not great definitely not heinz
the pizza be delicious
-PRON- normally do not like hot wing
but -PRON- be really good
nice and crispy
-PRON- kid love -PRON- so much
-PRON- want to go back before -PRON- head back to cali
now this be can not miss festival
the entertainment the people the activity for the kid the food
-PRON- be all greek to -PRON-
there be always load of people but -PRON- be not unbearable
-PRON- have take -PRON- daughter since -PRON- be a baby
and -PRON- have always have a good time
-PRON- suggest parking on the side street and walk towards the church rather than the main street
-PRON- always walk away with container fill with either -PRON- wedding cookie loukmade or baklava
each year -PRON- try a different main dish and -PRON- be never disappointed
-PRON- highly recommend try -PRON- greek fries can visit without eat some of that
the kid area be actually well put together and not to overly price
-PRON- should however work on have the vendor work together so the all day pass can be utilize on all ride and jump castle
the food line do not get to crazy from what -PRON- have see
but -PRON- usually go at off time like once the festival start or mid day when -PRON- not too hot and not too cold
-PRON- prefer to frequent local business for example az art supply on scottsdale and shea
-PRON- be not a fan of the chain but this place have paper for half the price -PRON- usually pay and the customer service be among the good
most importantly -PRON- have copic marker
which be excellent since the alternative be to drive to tempe from north scottsdale
finally when two line have start to build -PRON- not only open a third register but the woman ask -PRON- specifically -PRON- would clearly be there the long if -PRON- want to come to the open register
-PRON- run -PRON- behind around the line and of course two woman have beat -PRON- there one of -PRON- be clearly plan on let -PRON- go ahead but not the other and the woman at the register very specifically take -PRON- first
customer service make a huuuge difference for -PRON-
-PRON- may seem like a small thing but have -PRON- ever stand 20 minute watch a cashier take everyone behind -PRON- and watch -PRON- all get ring up and leave before -PRON- even get to -PRON-
why go to a place like that when -PRON- can go somewhere customer service mean something
so great customer service the price be excellent and -PRON- have just about everything
-PRON- highly recommend -PRON-
yours truly be one of those place where -PRON- have a huge option of choice from breakfast to lunch
as good as some of -PRON- lunch option be sweet potato fry be super yummy -PRON- have to say -PRON- usually always order breakfast
in fact -PRON- normally order the same thing every time -PRON- go
-PRON- have to say -PRON- favorite be the gorgeous omelet
-PRON- have gorgonzola cheese ham spinich
and -PRON- can order -PRON- with egg white too
great spot for brunch with the family and the valley view location have the cut little toy train table to keep the little one occupy if there be a little wait on a busy sunday
in the past viper hobbies be a place -PRON- try to avoid
mainly because of the poor customer service and lack of experience by the employee
today -PRON- be a whole new story
-PRON- do not know if the store change owner or if the just step up the service but the change be for the good
now -PRON- have a very helpful and knowledgeable staff willing to spend time with customer
the store be jam pack with product and most of the time -PRON- will have what -PRON- be look for
good job guy
keep -PRON- up
very cute tea shop
-PRON- order the honey milk tea and -PRON- be delicious
-PRON- would definitely recommend come here
the only thing that be lack be the service but -PRON- think the tea make up for -PRON-
great neighborhood bar\/restaurant
-PRON- come for lunch on a frequent basis and -PRON- remember -PRON- standard order baja sandwich with extra crispy fry every time
-PRON- have also have work event and -PRON- fantasy football draft there
-PRON- be always willing to work with -PRON- on reserve space and rearrange table to meet -PRON- need
$ 2.50 draft at happy hour and great wing make for a nice evening
also lot of tv for sport viewing
who do -PRON- hair
this be a question that -PRON- be often ask and -PRON- be ready to share -PRON- secret jen fagan
-PRON- have be do -PRON- hair for ten year now and always leave -PRON- feel sassy
-PRON- have thick curly hair that can easily be ruin with a bad cut
but -PRON- know which cut will not work -PRON- be not afraid to say do -PRON- really want to straighten -PRON- hair every day
this cut will require -PRON-
-PRON- work with -PRON- to give -PRON- something fresh that -PRON- can maintain every day
ohhh and the color
-PRON- be a true artist when -PRON- come to coloring sometimes -PRON- think -PRON- be more excited than -PRON- be to see the foil come off and reveal -PRON- work
need hair help
go to jen
-PRON- just start a job over here and be happy to find a little place that be right by where -PRON- will be work
-PRON- be a decent sized place and when -PRON- first walk in -PRON- be worried because the line be pretty long
well -PRON- have to say the line be definitely from the yumminess price of the food because -PRON- move -PRON- through super fast
-PRON- have alot to choose from and -PRON- try the chicken parmesan
the cheese be just drip off and man -PRON- be good
-PRON- will definitely be back to this little place
note mention -PRON- be refer by antonieta hensley
this clinic be fast and easy and get straight to the point the doctor be friendly and accept
staff be nice and -PRON- be in and out in 40 min
no need to worry there be a chiropractor on site ready to help -PRON- if -PRON- do not have medical record if -PRON- want to save more money go ahead and put on the section of refer by antonieta hensley
-PRON- get a discount when -PRON- be refer can -PRON- get point too so pay -PRON- forward
love -PRON- here the pink sauce be great the filet hibachi be awesome and -PRON- put on a great show
brunch here be totally amazing
cornbread brisket thing be one of the good brunch food -PRON- have have in toronto if not the good
-PRON- too bad -PRON- so small and the line be so long to get in
-PRON- have be here a few time now
so -PRON- think -PRON- can safely review
-PRON- teriyaki sauce be pretty generic not really amazing or bad
-PRON- eel with rice be not too bad
-PRON- chicken with veggie and rice be probably -PRON- favorite
-PRON- will sometimes use a mix of dark and white meat
but -PRON- be generally cook pretty well
-PRON- do not recommend the beef
especially on this order -PRON- have a lot of tough tendon in mine that be inedible
also when -PRON- order vegetable without rice -PRON- be usually give like a soup which can be disappointing
-PRON- be likely because -PRON- add freshly steam vegetable without let the water run off so soup
-PRON- have not be here in year but -PRON- husband and -PRON- be drive that way and -PRON- suggest -PRON- because of fond food memory
-PRON- have never be here and be game for a new experience
this place remind -PRON- of a waffle house with a bar and -PRON- say that in the nice way
-PRON- be small narrow and long with some table booth and half booth
-PRON- sit at the bar and the bartender remind -PRON- of a waffle house waitress sincere efficient and friendly
-PRON- can imagine that -PRON- would treat guest in -PRON- own home the way -PRON- treat -PRON-
good thing that -PRON- be write this review and not -PRON- husband
-PRON- do not like -PRON- meal
-PRON- get the tilapia special with lemon and caper
-PRON- husband say that fish be soggy with lemon juice the broccoli limp and the rice dry
-PRON- meal on the other hand be good
-PRON- get the cajun pasta san sausage
the waitress do not give -PRON- grief about leave out the sausage
-PRON- be a vegetarian that be try to include some shellfish in the diet so -PRON- allow the shrimp
-PRON- be a little overcook and frankly -PRON- think that -PRON- would have enjoy the meal even more without -PRON-
the vegetable be tasty and the sauce be spicy and delectable
yum
both meal come with a salad and -PRON- both enjoy the fresh green and other vegetable
plus the crouton be crunchy and flavorful
-PRON- husband and -PRON- both enjoy the intimate ambiance and will return
-PRON- be write this review from the toilet seat in the mgm hotel
-PRON- eat at the rainforest cafe last night and have have explosive diarrhea ever since
suppose to drive back to la today
prayer please
this be the very first big whole foods -PRON- have ever be to
up until this point -PRON- experience have only be with the location in arlington va medium sized redondo beach small and la jolla small
when -PRON- walk into this location for the first time four year ago the heaven open up and choir music play
-PRON- be absolutely amazing and be now always -PRON- first stop on the way into town
the only downside be that the prepared food selection be so good that -PRON- have trouble control -PRON- and end up walk out with way too much crap that -PRON- can not possibly eat in the 2 5 day -PRON- be go to be in the vegas
to give -PRON- an example -PRON- have so many soup that -PRON- have to divide -PRON- up by type seafood bbq vegetarian mexican etc
the salad bar yes plural be also divide up include a mexican section purely salad section and vegetarian section
the sushi area be amazing and there be several seating area inside where -PRON- can dine
-PRON- have hear rumor that -PRON- can drink alcohol on the premise but -PRON- have not experience this -PRON- be vegas and whole foods -PRON- would not surprise -PRON-
with -PRON- power combine
-PRON- be unstoppable
there be a lot of hater out there and -PRON- be understandable
if -PRON- have never be vegan -PRON- will not appreciate this place
if -PRON- have never be vegetarian -PRON- will not appreciate this place
if -PRON- have no idea what 100 organic actually mean
-PRON- will not appreciate this place
if -PRON- do not know anything about the difference between a complex carbohydrate and a simple sugar -PRON- will not appreciate this place
and if -PRON- do not know the difference between whole wheat and wheat you will not appreciate this place
-PRON- be expensive
but the good stuff always be
oh and during the summer -PRON- air conditioning rock
ironic but awesome
this bar be fantastic and the food be amazing
mini corn dog be -PRON- favorite
the bartender be all very friendly but -PRON- favorite be shilo
-PRON- always greet -PRON- with a smile and sweet disposition
-PRON- highly recommend this location
come here during restaurant week
the server do not even mention that -PRON- be participate in restaurant week
and -PRON- have to ask for the restaurant week menu
also the restaurant be dead for a thursday evening
this be a fairly large restaurant and only have five table fill
-PRON- should have take that as a hint
-PRON- have the sea bass bite for the entree however -PRON- feel that the honey mustard sauce somewhat over power the sea bass
service be spotty as well
desert be microwave bread bud
the only reason that -PRON- give -PRON- three star be for the fact that -PRON- have very reasonable wine by the glass pricing with a great selection
-PRON- go there for lunch today
the food seem pricey
-PRON- have the mushroom pizza for $ 14 which be ok
there be 2 piece leave and neither -PRON- or -PRON- guest take -PRON- home
the italian salad be very good but a bit pricey for $ 12
-PRON- have coffee and -PRON- be so weak -PRON- could not drink -PRON-
the service be good
but -PRON- do not think -PRON- would go back
das kommt offenbar dabei raus wenn sich bwl praktikanten mal zwischen internet spielen und facebook in sachen erlebnis-
oder system-
gastronomie austoben dürfen
ein schnellrestaurant mit italienischem speise touch bei dem die technik den gast und natürlich die überforderten kellner für die getränke mit einer art bizarrer disneyland technik dominiert
erstaunlicherweise waren die speisen nicht virtuell sondern nach vielem
anstehen und
nachfragen real und gar nicht übel
das chipkarten rechnungs prozedere gewährleistet dass man
-PRON-
be regelfall wenigsten beim zahlen nicht
anstehen muss nachdem man dazu um an seine speisen zu kommen ja schon ausgiebig an den countern
so heißt das wohl -PRON- be dortigen erlebnispark
gelegenheit hatte
schön dass auch noch zu später stunde in der küche gewirbelt wird aber um einen theaterbesuch o.ä
in aller ruhe zu beschließen wohl denkbar ungeeignet
zum mittags essen quicky anstelle kantine oder mensa sicher eher
gut gedacht ist eben immer noch meisten das gegenteil von gut gemacht
ich hoffe dass ich hi nicht die zukunft unserer gastronomie erlebt habe
this aroma be weak at good
but for a kiosk location what can -PRON- expect
-PRON- hygiene leave something to be desire as the plastic glove stay on no matter what
the cook answer -PRON- cell with the same glove -PRON- be make -PRON- sandwich with
that same phone -PRON- probably take to the washroom with -PRON- on break
oh and when -PRON- have to step in on cash same thing same glove then -PRON- go back to the kitchen
-PRON- order coffee only here
-PRON- experience bad service today
come in for -PRON- usual rib dinner but unfortunately -PRON- run out
no problem -PRON- end up order 2 rib tip dinner and a brisket dinner
1
the skinny black server be wear short hang halfway down -PRON- butt
not very appetizing while dish out food
wtf
2
-PRON- take -PRON- order slip and after help out the 2 lady in front of -PRON- -PRON- then proceed to fill the order of 2 lady that be behind -PRON- in line
wtf
3
then -PRON- have the nerve to tell -PRON- to move because -PRON- be hold up the line
wtf
4
as the empty pan be be change out -PRON- be drip pan condensation water all over the other food
wtf
the food be still good but -PRON- employee need to be monitor because -PRON- attire service and food handling need upgrading
-PRON- start see dr. kanelos 3 year ago when -PRON- family of 4 move to charlotte
find a doctor for -PRON- be the bad and scary part of move
-PRON- take a special doctor who can gain -PRON- trust and respect and that be exactly what dr. kanelos have do
-PRON- be the kind of doctor that when -PRON- be scared and concerned as a parent can walk into the room and instantly make all -PRON- worry melt away
-PRON- have the kind demeanor especially with child
-PRON- do not just give -PRON- an answer but educate -PRON- and even give -PRON- all the option that be available
-PRON- always make a point to give -PRON- good recommendation but -PRON- appreciate that -PRON- make -PRON- aware that there be other option when available
-PRON- have always respect -PRON- delayed vaccination schedule with both of -PRON- child and have provide -PRON- opinion and expertise as need
-PRON- have since move 4 hour away
and -PRON- still see -PRON-
that be right
-PRON- drive 4 hour to see -PRON- with 2 small child because -PRON- be worth -PRON- to -PRON-
-PRON- medical assistant be sweet as can be and always call -PRON- back same day when -PRON- have a question
-PRON- have also see nurse spratt a couple of time and think -PRON- be amazing as well
-PRON- do see another nurse who -PRON- be not crazy about
but -PRON- inform the front desk and -PRON- be proactive to solve -PRON- issue and have note that -PRON- do not see -PRON-
-PRON- recognize that -PRON- be not always go to love every one in a practice
but -PRON- could not have ask -PRON- to handle -PRON- situation any better than -PRON- do
everyone know insurance have become more confusing and difficult
-PRON- do stop take certain insurance and have since add many back
however in the mean time -PRON- create a plan for patient who do not have insurance that -PRON- accept which be what -PRON- family opt for and -PRON- find -PRON- to be easy and great for -PRON- family
-PRON- offer a lot of help if -PRON- have any insurance question as -PRON- do and -PRON- make -PRON- easy for -PRON- to
-PRON- have be wait almost an hour
the doctor prescribe -PRON- medicine without explain the side effect or method of take the medication
-PRON- have also leave multiple message to get -PRON- off of this medicine
and -PRON- have get 1\/4 response to -PRON- call
-PRON- would keep look and refer elsewhere
what an indulgent treat
a friend and -PRON- come here for an evening treat and -PRON- both order a half cookie sandwich which be still pretty big
-PRON- have a chocolate cookie with lemon meringue ice cream and -PRON- have the oat and date cookie with strawberry ice cream
totally yum
-PRON- be really tasty but -PRON- be a really big portion even at the half size
so -PRON- get kind of sick of -PRON- towards the end
the ice cream be delicious and the flavour really stand out especially in the lemon meringue
the strawberry ice cream have what look like real strawberry puree in -PRON- so that be a great surprise and really affect the taste positively
all component cookie and ice cream be awesome and fresh and high quality though -PRON- think next time -PRON- think -PRON- will share the half sandwich with a friend
there be other option like the hong kong waffle or french macaron sandwich which be cool and interesting
maybe -PRON- will try those next time
-PRON- be a bit pricey at $ 4.50 before tax per half sandwich and other treat at $ 7 to $ 10 ish
but -PRON- be a fun place to indulge once in a while if -PRON- can stand the long line up
-PRON- have be to sabor on hawthorne and 7th street quite a few time
-PRON- decide to try the one in matthews
not sure if -PRON- be matthews or weddington or waxhaw
-PRON- in the country
but -PRON- be a great grill
locate in a strip mall where the harris teeter 201 be
the food be even good than the one on 7th
-PRON- always good do not get -PRON- wrong
but this be particularly fresh and good
two of -PRON- party have the quinoa bowl with pork and avocado
fresh and good
-PRON- have empanada with chicken and the wonderful mexican corn with the cheese and spice on it!.
everything be quick but have the great flavor of country!. of course the pineapple habanero salsa be sooooo good the whole salsa bar be fantastic
-PRON- would highly recommend any of the sabor location
this one have a special place in -PRON- mind now
-PRON- just sign up for -PRON- costco membership last week and -PRON- ask for -PRON- email address
-PRON- ask the lady wish -PRON- could remember -PRON- name in membership what -PRON- need the email for and -PRON- say just to notify -PRON- about a recall regard a purchase
-PRON- say ok -PRON- will give -PRON-
but -PRON- do not want any marketing email
-PRON- say ok and -PRON- would not receive any
guess what -PRON- have in -PRON- email box now?
here be a suggestion do not lie to -PRON- new customer membership service
-PRON- new favorite place for italian when -PRON- be uptown or in dilworth area
a wonderful addition to this area
space much improve for dark and dreary lapaz caveman space
from the moment -PRON- walk into the new bright expansive restaurant -PRON- be treat like -PRON- be the only patron there even though there be a large party of 10 12 rigth beside -PRON- -PRON- service never waiver
-PRON- server adela be great even recommend -PRON- share a plate since the portion be quite large
-PRON- opt for a chop salad with a mild italian dressing variety of lettuce crisp with fresh garbonzo bean and a wedge salad with -PRON- house dressing which be similar to ranch
both be bring out in chilled plate huge plus in -PRON- book
-PRON- be the little thing that be do throughout the evening that make for such an enjoyable dinner
-PRON- note to adela that -PRON- be not in any hurry and -PRON- pace the delivery of the entree accordingly
-PRON- pair the coco lasagna crazy lasagna with a nice slightly chill italian wine
-PRON- love -PRON- when a restaurant serve the red wine at the appropriate temperature not room temperature at 72 to 74 degree but more 66 to 68
-PRON- so improve the wine experience
get back to the lasagna kitchen split the dish before serve to -PRON- and hello no splitting charge which -PRON- have yet to figure out why any establishment would do this
same quantity of food only take 2 second to split and plate on two plate instead of one and -PRON- charge for this
hubby aka bulldawg love -PRON- lasagna but love -PRON- garlic too and think maybe dish could have have a little more garlic
enter alexander stage right
-PRON- ask bully about -PRON- food and -PRON- do not hold back on -PRON- need for speed
-PRON- mean garlic next thing -PRON- know bully 's dish disappear and reappear a few minute later with an improved bolognese sauce with bully 's drug of choice garlic
-PRON- could not get enough of this sauce
-PRON- actually think the second dish -PRON- bring to the table be another full portion which be great totally unexpected and add with -PRON- leftover -PRON- will have another full meal
this place be a date night girl nite out hide out from the in law and pretend -PRON- be in italy kind of place
love every minute -PRON- be there
and oh yes free valet parking
this place do -PRON- right
camille 's seem like an ok place to go for lunch
the menu have a lot of option sandwich paninis wrap salad and flatbread pizza
-PRON- try the pepperoni pizza which be pretty good for a non pizza place
-PRON- boyfriend be not too impressed with -PRON- roast beef panini
the atmosphere be cute although -PRON- walk in through the street entrance which be kind of the back door because the main entrance face the parking lot in the back and could not really figure out which line to wait in etc
after -PRON- order -PRON- be not sure whether -PRON- would call out number or bring -PRON- -PRON- food
seem like -PRON- just need to improve communication a bit
great sushi and staff
-PRON- server mike be great in identify the roll snd sake to get highly recommend

-PRON- vehicle be recently involve in an accident and need some repair
after say repair the body shop do the work have -PRON- align at a different shop and -PRON- do not do a great job
-PRON- have have several friend come to arrow
so -PRON- figure -PRON- would have -PRON- take a stab at -PRON- truck
-PRON- do an amazing job and despite the fact that something may still be slightly bent in the front end joe manage to -PRON- align damn near perfect
-PRON- truck drive better than -PRON- do before the accident
would not hesitate to bring any of -PRON- vehicle here
great service and friendly staff
totally great experience
sit at the counter\/bar and watch -PRON- work
good dessert experience ever and -PRON- have be around
yes a bit pricey but well worth
look forward to next visit
-PRON- absolutely love the watershed
-PRON- have host 4 private event at this venue both in -PRON- private captain 's lounge room and out on the deck
the staff be always helpful friendly -PRON- guest have all enjoy -PRON- and thank -PRON- for choose such a cool spot for -PRON- event
the chef be flexible and will make vegan gluten free entree by request and -PRON- bar be so cool
great environment and great people
-PRON- will definitely go back many more time
service be very slow
rarely do -PRON- see anyone wipe of the table even when -PRON- be slow
restaurant employee park in the close space to the restaurant just show how there be no management skill there
always see people fill up -PRON- water cup with soda that be just steal not to mention -PRON- drive up the price
luckily the food have never be a problem
-PRON- would say that this be the second good irish pub in vegas which be not to say that -PRON- be anything other than a great place to dine drink and have a bit of craic which incidentally be the irish word for fun enjoyment and fellowship
the only place -PRON- find that beat -PRON- out be mcmullan 's a free stand joint near the orleans hotel casino a bit west of the strip on tropicana
this one beat nine fine irishmen in the new york new york for the number 2 spot on -PRON- list
the food be fantastic the ambience be spot on and although the place be a small than the nine fine irishmen -PRON- have a more authentic feel to -PRON- especially since -PRON- can sit at the bar and be within arm 's reach of the stage
the service be top notch and -PRON- be well take care of during all -PRON- visit
the bartender and server be always on top of whether -PRON- may need another pint and willing to offer -PRON- own suggestion of what to try next
-PRON- have a surprising number of different libation available from the ubiquitous guinness smithwick 's and harp on tap to a variety of different irish cider -PRON- would never even hear of in bottle
-PRON- be very glad to try some new thing to compliment old favorite and -PRON- can not recommend ask what special offering -PRON- currently feature enough
try something new
live a little and enjoy the craic
-PRON- be really surprise one night when -PRON- pop in for a pint that derek warfield and the young wolfe tones be play
live music be all the sign say and -PRON- about fall off -PRON- bar stool when -PRON- see who -PRON- be
-PRON- be a little miffed that -PRON- have not really advertise -PRON- presence though -PRON- find out that not a lot of people who have come in for live irish music that night know either so -PRON- suppose that -PRON- target demographic be not the most knowledgeable about irish music
-PRON- can not really complain because -PRON- get to see -PRON- play on a lark without a huge thronging crowd get in the way so -PRON- will definitely drop in for a pint again when -PRON- come back through town
a local 's treasure
-PRON- have be come here since -PRON- decide to call henderson -PRON- home
if -PRON- be look for non chainy italian food that taste homemade this be -PRON-
-PRON- be as if a restaurant from little italy ny or the hill in stl grow wing and land in this strip mall
the garlic knot be fabulous and -PRON- have to hold -PRON- off from eat too many so -PRON- have room for dinner
when -PRON- first come here -PRON- be proper knot but -PRON- be now garlic nub
-PRON- still taste great though
if -PRON- like calzone -PRON- be perfectly make
-PRON- can order -PRON- bake or fry
if -PRON- do not like ricotta -PRON- can ask -PRON- not to include -PRON-
-PRON- personally like the sweet sausage some of the good -PRON- have have with the perfect amount of anise
-PRON- can choose from about 4 5 pasta to compliment -PRON- meal
-PRON- favorite dish be the sweet sausage with pasta braciole spaghetti and meatball linguine with red clam sauce meatloaf and spaghetti or any of the chicken dish
the serving be big so -PRON- may have leftover
if -PRON- be full think about bring home some treat from the glass case upfront
-PRON- always bring back rainbow cookie for -PRON- kid
the italian cheesecake be out of this world one of the good on the west coast
the staff treat -PRON- like one of -PRON- own along with the home style meal -PRON- be like -PRON- be have a sunday family dinner
despite all the good review for this place -PRON- will stick to -PRON- initial comment if u go to a so call asian restaurant and there be no asian people inside get the f out
food be either too salty or too sweet
go there for lunch and as soon as i get in realize that i be the inky asian person in there
-PRON- have decide to still give -PRON- a try sinxe many of -PRON- foodie friend have have good comment about the place
seriously do not understand why people say -PRON- be one of the good restaurant in montreal
alright the place look decent consider that -PRON- be in chinatown but food just be ok
this place be a joke
-PRON- show up at 930 am on monday for an oil change and -PRON- say -PRON- should be do before close
should lbe
so then today -PRON- be there a few minute after 7 a.m. and say -PRON- need tire and an oil change on a different vehicle
this time -PRON- be tell be may be do by 5 p.m.
-PRON- say that be ridiculous since there be no one else there and only 2 car in the bay
-PRON- have about 10 bay
-PRON- tell the guy -PRON- be insane that -PRON- manage a company next door and would live to send -PRON- fleet work there
but -PRON- seem to not want business
-PRON- quickly change -PRON- tune and ask when -PRON- need the car do by
-PRON- say do not worry about -PRON- -PRON- will find a shop who actually act like -PRON- want to do the work
drive 4 stop light to the other purcell location
-PRON- be tempe and be treat awesomely
-PRON- advice go to the mill and southern location
these dude be a joke
john thank -PRON- -PRON- have tire and an oil change at the southern and mill location on a silver 2013 altima
-PRON- should have all -PRON- contact info there
amy be -PRON- therapist at a+
-PRON- really know -PRON- pressure point and work out all -PRON- knot
-PRON- like a firm and strong hand
so -PRON- think that -PRON- pressure be perfect
for those who like a superficial swedish style may need to let -PRON- know to go lightly but for those who like deep tissue or shiatsu style would find that -PRON- will want to come back for more regularly
the price certainly make -PRON- affordable enough for regular treatment
-PRON- will definitely come back to -PRON- everytime
-PRON- be in town
-PRON- be hesitant to give -PRON- 5 star because -PRON- have to answer the phone or greet client a couple of time during the session but -PRON- do regardless because -PRON- be very apologetic and give -PRON- an extra 10 minute to make up for -PRON-
be a small business owner -PRON-
-PRON- be sympathetic with -PRON- be shorthand
at least the massage -PRON- be anything but shorthand
-PRON- will be back for sure
eh
a tv dinner would have be more satisfying
slow service and the food all seem like -PRON- come out of a box -PRON- be the freezer
not worth the price
the food be really good but incredibly high price
-PRON- order a gluten free veggie pizza
the price be not on the menu so imagine -PRON- surprise when the bill come out and -PRON- be $ 18.00
-PRON- come here for easter sunday brunch and -PRON- be nice the food be yummy
-PRON- friend get the seafood crepe and -PRON- get the beef bourge bene which be so yummy and tasty
-PRON- server cheryl be really nice but geez the staff at the hostess stand have a snappy attitude
overall a good experience
if -PRON- intend to sit at the patio -PRON- have to join the waitlist -PRON- do not take reservation for that area
good to make a reservation if -PRON- just want to try the food anyway
-PRON- be not plan to eat here but -PRON- be convenient because -PRON- be stay at the hotel and have a line pass
the seating area decor be just a step above hometown buffet and really nothing to write home about
-PRON- also wait a while before someone take -PRON- beverage order
but hey -PRON- be a buffet and oh the food
the standout for -PRON- be
prime rib quality reminiscent of house of prime rib in sf -PRON- fave and there be even yorkshire pudding with creamed spinach if -PRON- want to recreate -PRON- hopr plate alaskan king crab + snow crab
humma and -PRON- stop pace -PRON- here and heap 2 full plate regret come later
pro tip come at 3:15pm pay the weekend brunch price of $ 28 pp and enjoy dinner selection at 3:30pm for $ 10 less
good of all this 2.5 hr glutton induce ordeal keep -PRON- full for the rest of the night
this location be absolutely amazing
this team and the manager tonight take customer service to the next level
-PRON- initially go to the flamingo location to pick up dinner after school for -PRON- husband and i.
-PRON- order be cold and shabby look
so -PRON- stop at this location close to -PRON- house with -PRON- receipt to see if -PRON- could help-
-PRON- look at the time stamp look at -PRON- order and unbelievably this team step up and make a fresh batch for -PRON-
-PRON- uphold the brand standard make sure -PRON- know that dinner be as important to -PRON- as -PRON- be to -PRON-
-PRON- can not thank -PRON- enough
happyhousewife
joey 's be da bomb
-PRON- be in cave creek earlier this week for a yoga class and notice joey 's of chicago in the same plaza
have like the food at -PRON- happy valley location -PRON- have to give this one a try too
-PRON- order hot dog with everything fry and onion ring
everything be great and satisfied that crave -PRON- get once in a while for a good chicago style hot dog
so if -PRON- be from chicago or like chicago style dog
joey 's be the place
slow slow slow service
sit at a table for 15 minute and no one have even acknowledge -PRON-
most people at an airport be not here for a leisurely evening -PRON- be in a hurry
-PRON- need to step -PRON- up
3.5 star got to say -PRON- be enjoy these fast food restaurant that spotlight chicken rather than beef burger
two of -PRON- share the caniac combo which be more than enough food with 6 crunchy chicken strip crinkle cut fry texas toast which be more plain than some review will have -PRON- believe unfortunately
cane 's dipping sauce be like a zesty thousand island dressing but spice differently cajun perhaps
under $ 10 for this meal which include a yummy addictive sweet tea
would consider pay -PRON- a second visit on -PRON- way out of town as cane 's be en route to las
-PRON- be pretty and the onion ring be good
-PRON- be seriously regret the sea bass an hour later though
service 3.5 star the two gentleman behind the counter be friendly but the steady flow of traffic preclude anything more than just transactional interaction
-PRON- deliver -PRON- food with a smile and graciously bring over a tray of condiment but never be able to break away from the counter so check in on -PRON- food
-PRON- do a nice job of explain all the coffee option but -PRON- be hard to understand everything -PRON- say because of the noise level
venue 3 star
from a purely visual perspective a ok would garner a 4.5 rating for -PRON- transformation of the old savidusky 's fur retail shop into a stylish space with a post industrial vibe
as mention in other review the vault door from the fur repository be a show stopper
also visually strike be the blue and gold geometric floor tile and the shiny white subway tile utilize around the coffee bar
but functionally all those hard surface amplify the sound of two very industrious barista caffeinat hipster converse and energetic preschooler accompany -PRON- mother congregate for -PRON- morning coffee klatch
mix in louder than normal background music 90 alt rock like weezer green day and rem
and -PRON- will find -PRON- reach for -PRON- earbud to filter out some of the din
another frustrating aspect of a ok be the lack of street parking during weekday
-PRON- have abort two attempt at grab a lunch at a ok simply because -PRON- could not locate street parking within three block of -PRON- facility
thumbs up for free wi fi with a strong signal throughout the morning
food drink 3 star
the breakfast food be a mixed bag
-PRON- enjoy -PRON- corned beef hash breakfast but feel -PRON- be pricey at $ 12 consider -PRON- could travel several block and get madison sourdough 's perfectly execute breakfast hash with a wonderfully dressed side salad for $ 2 less
-PRON- primary beef with -PRON- dish be the complete and utter lack of salt on -PRON- meal
while -PRON- appreciate that everyone have -PRON- personal salt preference there should to be a base level of season
in addition there should be salt shaker on the all the table if salting be to be a diy affair at a ok
-PRON- daughter 's country breakfast egg hash brown bacon sausage and a freshly make buttermilk biscuit miss the mark
the primary offender be the severely undercooked and under season hash brown with still crunchy onion but the slightly dry scramble egg also disappoint
the star of -PRON- plate be the scrumptious buttermilk biscuit perfectly crunchy on the exterior and pillowy soft in the center
the menu 's biscuit and gravy option may be the correct play for future visit
while the chai tea latte do not supplant graze for good in class -PRON- daughter feel the a ok 's rendition be easily in the top quartile for madison
-PRON- chemex coffee be a ok but -PRON- need to consume -PRON- rapidly to prevent the first world problem of lukewarm coffee as the content of the glass carafe cool quickly
overall rating 3 star
give -PRON- johnson public house bloodline and -PRON- visually appealing venue -PRON- admittedly have elevated expectation for this coffee shop
while there be plenty to like the lackluster food will keep -PRON- on the sideline for a while
yelp define a 3 star rating as a ok so who be -PRON- to disagree
this be -PRON- new favorite in old town scottsdale
the restaurant be elegant and service be amazing
be ready to eat for sure if -PRON- come here
-PRON- try the chop salad and mac and cheese which be to die for
by the time -PRON- get -PRON- meal -PRON- be full
-PRON- do not matter though because when -PRON- each take out first bite -PRON- be instantly rejuvenate
-PRON- stomach open up and -PRON- keep eat the killer meatloaf short rib chicken and crab cake
thank -PRON- citizen public house
-PRON- be a must return to place whenever -PRON- be in town with people
smash burger have the good burger -PRON- have ever taste
there be a good selection of burger to choose from and every one -PRON- have try have be fantastic
-PRON- have not be to the typical fast food burger place since -PRON- discover smash burger
a good value for the price as well
never buy a car there and now -PRON- never will but call -PRON- for help with a dodge recall
service dept number go right to voicemail
go to the website try online chat
ask -PRON- for all -PRON- info then say -PRON- could not help -PRON- and end the chat
so if -PRON- get a recall notice from dodge do not call this dealership
-PRON- clearly be not interested in fix -PRON-
holy cow
that be what -PRON- say when -PRON- have -PRON- first cheesesteak from here
-PRON- be a pretty generous serving of chop up and well seasoned beef pack onto a large hoagie roll
the beef be flavorful and ooze of greasy juice goodness
good stuff
not a big fan of bread and -PRON- usually get burger wrap in lettuce but be fine with -PRON- here since -PRON- really need a fork to eat -PRON- sandwich
-PRON- just have -PRON- open face way and put the top part of the hoagie roll aside
do not mistake this place for the other cheesesteak franchise with a similar name
this straight from philly be owner operate and run by a family
everything here be cook to order
the menu be pretty extensive
-PRON- offer a variety of different way -PRON- can have -PRON- cheesesteak
with sweet pepper hot pepper mushroom genoa salami grill onion and even steak with no cheese
(who do that
so far -PRON- have try the cheesesteak bomb with genoa salami and the sweet pepper cheesesteak
since -PRON- be more of a veggie type of person -PRON- like the sweet pepper cheesesteak better than the all meat one
the sandwich shop be fast food type of joint
-PRON- use to be a ice cream\/hot dog place couple year ago
if -PRON- remember the space that occupy here -PRON- keep the bright yellow black\/white check wall minus the retro wall decor that use to be there
-PRON- still have the ice cream case but not sure if -PRON- sell ice cream
dining area be real casual metal table and chair along the wall small space but plenty of room to move
the owner be cool and -PRON- order come out in a timely manner consider -PRON- be pretty busy and -PRON- be just the two of -PRON- work
not sure though about hour of operation
come down late saturday afternoon only to find the place close for the day
lights out
store hour on window on yelp and -PRON- fb page say 11 9pm so -PRON- be a bit disappointed -PRON- could not have -PRON- cheesesteak fix
price seem reasonable enough for -PRON-
then again -PRON- be that person who do not even look at pricetag and just drop everything in the shopping cart when -PRON- be with mr. b.
but under $ 10 for a philly cheesesteak with lot of meat be a bargain in -PRON- book
fast become another regular customer here too
thing to note
close on sunday -PRON- also have chicken aka philly style burger and gyro on the menu and -PRON- have delivery service
what a great time and be so close to win
-PRON- be in a group of eight and -PRON- need all of -PRON-
-PRON- would recommend -PRON- for anyone -PRON- be awesome
have the lao larb
good as -PRON- should be
nothing crazy good or bad just right
the peanut sauce for the fresh roll be warm and very smooth very good
this place get a low 2 star due to the pathetic service
-PRON- server take -PRON- order deliver -PRON- drink then go outside to smoke
-PRON- bring -PRON- -PRON- fresh roll then leave and drive off
okay
a woman bring -PRON- main meal larb
-PRON- wait and wait and wait for a water refill to no avail
-PRON- be the only person in the place the entire time -PRON- be there
anyway -PRON- be okay food -PRON- think truc next door be much good and much good service and price
go there where -PRON- appreciate -PRON- business
very nice salon
clean pleasant tech great price
not enough staff long wait even with appointment
really 3.5.i feel more of a 3 fiance feel more of a 4 so -PRON- decide to round up
the place seem to be family own and completely empty at 7 pm
-PRON- hope -PRON- be able to make -PRON-
-PRON- be hard open a restaurant in this economy
anyways on to the food
fiance order the pull pork sandwich with no cole slaw
-PRON- order the pulled chicken
-PRON- have a side of mac and cheese
cashier seem friendly and excited -PRON- have actually stop in lol
sadly despite the fact that -PRON- be empty -PRON- do not listen to -PRON- no cole slaw request
no biggie
-PRON- realize that be just -PRON- be picky b*stard
-PRON- be both serve on tasty ciabatta roll
weird for bbq but yummy
-PRON- have cute\/bizarre branding stamp on -PRON-
now the important part the meat
the chicken be good
-PRON- mean hell
-PRON- be just chicken what do -PRON- expect
the pork though be awesome
tasty juicy etc
the mac and cheese be just eh
basically -PRON- be get the 4 star because the pull pork be good otherwise nothing terribly exciting about this place
-PRON- guess meat should be the most important thing about a bbq joint anyways though
be pretty good for -PRON- first time
the manager supervisor on duty be helpful with pick out a fun drink and give advice on a meat to pick
-PRON- want to try crawfish since -PRON- have never have
but -PRON- do not have -PRON- in
-PRON- assume a seasonal thing
but -PRON- do have the blue crab and mussel
delish will have to come back when -PRON- have crawfish for sure
-PRON- have to book a place for several of -PRON- budget friendly college student family member and
-PRON- lead to treasure island
the room be decent and modern with a small flat t.v. screen
the front desk person be helpful in give -PRON- two room adjacent to each other so -PRON- group could stay together since all the suite be take already
-PRON- try -PRON- dinner buffet because of the 2 for 1 special and boy
oh boy bad choice
the selection be so few and maybe 2 out of 6 dish be good
the only up side about the buffet be that the chef can make -PRON- vietnamese pho and personalize -PRON- pasta to -PRON- liking
-PRON- have to find activity outside this hotel
however -PRON- do get a free firework show from -PRON- hotel window because -PRON- would perform -PRON- pirate show around 7 p.m.
overall a decent place to sleep in for a decent price and -PRON- be on the strip close to a lot of activity
as cheesy as this place be the food be excellent
for the price everyone be really please
-PRON- come for a bachelorette party but do not see the show
if -PRON- be look for something sit down and by ti -PRON- should def try -PRON- out
the hawaiian bbq here be pretty good the sushi however be below average in fact -PRON- be borderline horrible
-PRON- would go there just for the bbq because there be not a lot of place around this area to get -PRON- hawaiian fix
beautiful space in look and sound
watch a great performance call stones world by tim ries and band
show be base on ries jazz sax version of stones tune
bernard fowler perform lead vocal
-PRON- be an excellent show
as for the venue the rcm be an amazing place to take in a concert
wonderful look and sound inside the theatre
gorgeous aesthetic all around
the view of the city night light from the reception\/bar area be incredible
-PRON- develop some business card for a client and -PRON- artwork be correct on both side however the end product have ink smear on one side and the artwork be offset on both side
-PRON- spec be be to overnight prints template
-PRON- have since use vistaprint and receive good quality
although -PRON- have never be on an even night new year valentine 's day etc
-PRON- must say that every visit to atria 's on old clairton have be an enjoyable one
food
-PRON- have never try a dish at atria 's that -PRON- do not at least enjoy some
there be a few item on the menu that -PRON- would rather get somewhere else but when -PRON- say a few -PRON- mean 2 or 3 out of 40 50 item on the permanent and seasonal menu
chicken parmesan
this be by far -PRON- favorite item on the menu
-PRON- get 2 large piece of butterflied chicken breast bread perfectly over a bed of delicious linguini and homemade marinara to die for
serve with a large piece of garlic bread -PRON- be so tempt to just get this every time -PRON- go
alas
atria 's be so good that -PRON- must expand -PRON- experience and try something new every time
bread service
-PRON- give -PRON- complementary bread although -PRON- highly suggest not fill up as -PRON- will regret not be able to fit more of -PRON- delicious entree in -PRON- stomach
the bread be serve cool\/cold but soft and with only a slightly chewy crust
the butter be delicious
but -PRON- have to ask -PRON- waitress to bring -PRON- out bread or else -PRON- will take forever
to get out to -PRON-
-PRON- would like -PRON- better if -PRON- be to bring -PRON- out with -PRON- drink or at lease
ask -PRON- during the drink order
sherry crab bisque
this unfortunately be one of the item -PRON- suggest pass up or ask very clearly for a sample to try -PRON- because while the bisque flavor be not bad -PRON- have definitely have good
-PRON- may just be spoil but -PRON- enjoy when there be a few chunk of crab piece in -PRON- bisque
the flavor alone be not enough to please -PRON- taste bud
other soups
the other soup -PRON- have try have not be anything special
all -PRON- remember about -PRON- be -PRON- taste like -PRON- be suppose to taste
not enough to order again for $ 5
-fried
zucchini
-PRON- recommend this
although -PRON- be $ 11 -PRON- be just enough to get out pallet in gear
and -PRON- be very tasty
-PRON-
caesar salad
the salad be a nice size for $ 5
-PRON- like to add a side of anchovy which be something -PRON- have actually never try before atria 's but -PRON- pair so well with the salad
-PRON- be not mushy but a bit firm and easy to chew
this be still the only place -PRON- will eat anchovy
award win cheddar burger
-PRON- husband be the one to order burger but -PRON- have to try everything on the menu
so of course -PRON- steal a bite or 2
the burger here be decent juicy and large
but -PRON- do not go to atria 's for the burger
blue cheese burger
this be the burger to try before all other here
-PRON- may just be -PRON- love of blue cheese talk
but -PRON- may have half -PRON- poor husband burger when -PRON- order this
-frie
the fry be definitely real potato but this mean that when fresh -PRON- be drip grease and a bit on the soggy side
-PRON- personally do not like natural potato fry but if -PRON- do -PRON- will get a huge basket to munch on
steak
-PRON- father in law have nothing but amazing thing to say about -PRON- filet
-PRON- be cook perfectly and full of flavor accord to -PRON-
bourbon braised pot roast
freakishly delicious but can be very salty just the way
-PRON- like -PRON-
dessert all of the desert be crazy good
try -PRON- all
service
the service here be okay but 4 star review would be unfair to -PRON- chef
all of -PRON- waiter and waitress have be nice
but -PRON- feel that add just one more server would allow the table that bit of time that lack
to be fair -PRON- food come out hot dish never pile up and -PRON- drink be never empty
there be just something -PRON- can not put -PRON- finger on that do not show a 5 star wait staff
ambiance
atria 's be loud
-PRON- mean hard to hear the person next to -PRON- loud
the front sun room be the bad
-PRON- always ask specifically not to sit there because -PRON- be just a large glass bowl fill with what sound like yell people
-PRON- definitely need something to downplay the noise this be not a divey sport bar fill with millennial
the bar area be slightly less noisy but still hard to hear -PRON- party then if -PRON- can get the dining room -PRON- recommend that
the only down side be now -PRON- have to deal with the kitchen noise
there really be no where to go in that restaurant to have a nice normal indoor voice conversation with other member of -PRON- table
attire
the crowd be old
but -PRON- still feel comfortable go in jean and a cute blouse
no one be go to care about how -PRON- dress
but -PRON- may feel out of place in a hawaiian shirt and flip flop
amazing
absolutely love the food here
-PRON- go salad a few app a pizza and a pasta dish and everything be exceptional
also the service be wonderful
overall -PRON- be very impressed will definitely go again
thank cibo
wow- -PRON- come here about 3 4 time a week
yes -PRON- love wally world
as usually -PRON- come for one thing and leave with a cart full
the only issue be when -PRON- come to hygiene product the shelf be always out of -PRON- and then -PRON- have to send for a employee to check the back
-PRON- do not get the milk tea
-PRON- come for the curry fish\/beef ball
-PRON- be $ 2.50 for 5 or $ 4 for 10
-PRON- get the $ 4 option
-PRON- ask for all beef ball and just as -PRON- be about to ask for a mix of the two the lady inside ask -PRON- if -PRON- could do a mix instead
-PRON- work out so that be all fine and dandy
the curry here be surprisingly aromatic
-PRON- would not liken this to chinese curry
-PRON- smell more like a malaysian or indian curry
-PRON- be spicy in a leaf -PRON- tongue tingly after eat kinda way
-PRON- like the fish ball more than the beef ball unusual for -PRON-
-PRON- have get a nice texture while be soft
-PRON- give -PRON- parent some as well and -PRON- dad think -PRON- be from that famous fish ball place in the heritage centre
that be kinda cool
for as long as -PRON- can remember -PRON- have absolutely hat go to the dentist
so when -PRON- start get a toothache -PRON- ignore the pain for as long as -PRON- could
-PRON- find pearly whites through yelp and sure enough -PRON- fellow yelper do not let -PRON- down
from the moment -PRON- walk in -PRON- be make to feel as think -PRON- the patient matter
-PRON- see dr ben for 3 appointment total and -PRON- must say -PRON- be absolutely amazing very kind actually listen to -PRON- concern be very gentle and make sure -PRON- explain every step before -PRON- start
and -PRON- be impressed by how patient -PRON- was- take -PRON- time
so -PRON- crown be just right
-PRON- would even give -PRON- little break during -PRON- treatment if -PRON- need one
the dental assistant desiree dessy be also very nice and helpful -PRON- give -PRON- some headphone to use during treatment
so -PRON- could listen to some music and try to mellow out
work in health care
-PRON- have see the bad and the good and -PRON- can assure -PRON- that this office be at the top of the list
yes the dentist office be still a little bit scary for -PRON- but know that there be dentists out there like dr ben have restore -PRON- faith a bit
-PRON- have a primary doctor appointment two week ago and -PRON- be extremely unhappy with the service
to start -PRON- come in a half hour early to make sure -PRON- have all -PRON- paperwork fill out for -PRON- appointment as -PRON- be a new patient
-PRON- be ready to go within 15 minute
-PRON- wait an hour just to be seat in a room then do not leave for another two hour
to note -PRON- have an appointment set a month in advance
-PRON- be prescribe a medication that need a pre- approval for authorization from the doctor for -PRON- insurance to cover the prescription cost
because -PRON- be tell -PRON- would take a few day -PRON- have to pay out of pocket for the medication and be promise a refund when the doctor approve the medication
the medication be not inexpensive
-PRON- have wait two week for the approval
-PRON- have call twice before today and be tell -PRON- would be take care of
today -PRON- have to call because -PRON- pharmacist say -PRON- still have not be approve
-PRON- have to call 3 time because -PRON- be transfer five time each time with each person ask what -PRON- need ask for all of -PRON- personal information from -PRON- and put -PRON- on hold for a total of 2 hour between the call before someone finally help -PRON-
this be absolutely unacceptable
-PRON- should not take -PRON- two hour to get information about -PRON- prescription authorization
-PRON- should not take a doctor office two week to authorize a medication when -PRON- be tell -PRON- would be do the day after -PRON- pick up -PRON- medication from pharmacist and just take a few day to complete
-PRON- have a feeling these people will not date the authorization for the day -PRON- have to pick up -PRON- medication two week ago
and -PRON- will have to take -PRON- loss because -PRON- can not do -PRON- job
-PRON- be find a new doctor
-PRON- do not recommend this facility to anyone with the exception of the quick care that be connect to the primary doctor
ehhhh
-PRON- want to like -PRON-
-PRON- really do
-PRON- know that flavor and texture be go to be different when try to recreate omnivorous dish with vegan ingredient
-PRON- be not expect -PRON- meatball sub sandwich to taste like -PRON- namesake but -PRON- want -PRON- to taste good
-PRON- do not
the grill cheese that taste great like a savory gruyère melt
but the texture smooth at first quickly become paste like and cause a traffic jam at the back of -PRON- throat make -PRON- difficult to swallow
the buffalo cauliflower be awesome
-PRON- suspect that every dish that be not try to be something -PRON- be not be probably excellent but that be not the majority of the menu
-PRON- have to say that -PRON- do not complain at all compliment the food when the server ask because everyone around -PRON- do as well
but later on -PRON- entire party all say something to the effect of yeah -PRON- be ok
but
yeah not go back
-PRON- think -PRON- all want to believe
essentially this place be the culinary equivalent of the emperor 's new clothes
-PRON- do not know if that be -PRON- fault or -PRON- but not go back
service be awesome though
yes -PRON- be in a gas station but who care
-PRON- customer service be awesome
the owner -PRON- wife and the rest of the staff make -PRON- feel at home
the food be amazing
the jefe 's burrito with chicken steak and shrimp have be on -PRON- mind every day since -PRON- have -PRON-
and -PRON- think -PRON- be addicted
good food great people amazing customer service
if -PRON- be in the area stop by this place or make the drive if -PRON- be not in the area trust -PRON- -PRON- be worth -PRON-
just move here from florida

well -PRON- can not say that -PRON- do not deliver what -PRON- promise
-PRON- be marks spencer simply food
-PRON- simply sell food from marks and spencer
simple
actually -PRON- a bit cleverer than that this particular shop be in the middle of waverly train station and -PRON- genuinly offer an alternative to the fast food and burger that litter the station
-PRON- be not cheap and a sandwich be after all just a sandwich but if -PRON- be look to stock up on -PRON- way home -PRON- actually a great place to grab some food
5 star for the extremely awesome wafflewich
hand down good wafflewich -PRON- have have

-PRON- order the braised beef sandwich and be surprised -PRON- be only $ 5.99
-PRON- be on a baguette with some carrot and come with a side of cucumber cilantro kinda slaw but not really a slaw but have a nice fresh crunch to -PRON-
the beef be nicely tender and flavourful
-PRON- be upset

nodding of head and an explosion of laughter settle the matter
very important
1
there be always a line
expect a wait
2
do not go expect perfectly cooked diverse selection of the good seafood
-PRON- be about flavorful dish from the 1970 's and 1980 be make from everyday stuff
that say fresh nondescript oyster on the half shell with cocktail sauce and horseradish
overcook but typical shrimp cocktail with an ok cocktail sauce
dump the horseradish in from the oyster to pump -PRON- up
chewy but tasty overcook little neck
main be straightforward
pan roast shell over cook lump crab shrimp and lobster in an old school brandy infuse tomato cream sauce and gumbos same over cooked seafood with andouille sausage and okra thicken with a red brick roux both serve with everyday steamed rice be good eat for sure
along with the seafood jambalaya plain ole good comfort food
unfortunately the bouillabaisse and sf classic cioppino really miss the mark
-PRON- be hard to enjoy dish that have be perfect and widely available elsewhere
sorry but the use of previously frozen cod over cooked clam mussel headless shrimp and previously steam crab do not cut -PRON-
the sweet flavorful juice from the shrimp head and crab be miss and heck -PRON- be just more fun to pick at and suck seafood out of the shell
straight forward simple beer and wine list
inexpensive 2x retail
efficient service
the food be only three star
a fourth award because this be a vegas institution cheer godzilla x.
gave and mary be the good ever
-PRON- come in need help with a tuxedo and -PRON- could not have be good in make sure -PRON- be look sharp

good service -PRON- have ever have in a man 's store
thanks gabe and mary
ok
after try several round of the dog of the week -PRON- will sell -PRON- soul for another one of -PRON-
the variety that come out of the mind of local beer aficionado like chris from good bottle jason from salud and dude from omb birdsong or daniel from charlottebeer -PRON- be hooked
-PRON- be what -PRON- look forward to the most upon each visit
recently -PRON- check out the dog with peanut butter sriracha and bacon
ummm
yeah
-PRON- almost lose -PRON- mind
-PRON- be so good
anything that even slightly breathe that side of thai\/vietnamese flavor
also summertime call for a nice tall orangeade
the arnold palmer variety be rather refreshing too
not too sweet and ever so perky
winner winner
-PRON- stumble across this place just drive beside concord mills and originally think -PRON- be a mini storage
when -PRON- walk in -PRON- be not exactly sure of where to go
there be a lot of open space and the store be very clean
there be a hand sink in the dining room for -PRON- wash and sanitize -PRON- hand
the menu be relatively small and feature a couple of form of chicken strip and sandwich
what -PRON- be take back by be the fact that -PRON- have a turkey option for every chicken entree
on this particular trip -PRON- order the fried turkey sandwich
-PRON- be crispy juicy and very well worth the relatively high price
although there be some earthy undertone that -PRON- really be not a fan of
-PRON- get fry for -PRON- side and -PRON- load -PRON- box with fry almost past the point of five guy
-PRON- fry be season to perfection and the perfect mix of soft and crunchy
-PRON- also get a side of blueberry slaw which be just ok and really do not need the blueberry
over all this place be worth a try for lunch or quick fly by dinner
-PRON- should difinitely try -PRON- at least once
jane be an absolute treasure
-PRON- choose jane to go to to have -PRON- lip touch up after do quite a bit of research look for the one -PRON- want to work on -PRON- face a pretty big deal right
-PRON- have have -PRON- lip fully tattoo probably at least 15 year ago and -PRON- be time for a refresh
-PRON- be not sure if -PRON- should do the full lip again or just the liner
jane be so experienced and knowledgeable and skilled in -PRON- art do not feel the full lip would be the thing to do due to the way -PRON- initial tattooing be do by another artist all those year ago so -PRON- go for the liner
-PRON- be interested in make -PRON- lip more symmetrical and also the border be begin to dissipate so -PRON- need to define -PRON- as well
this lady be an artist in the full sense of the word
-PRON- be amazing
-PRON- take plenty of time to assess the canvas so to speak choose the perfect shade for -PRON- draw the most perfect pair of lip for me walk -PRON- through and hold -PRON- hand metaphorically when necessary the entire process as -PRON- go
-PRON- do everything -PRON- could to ensure -PRON- comfort both physically and mentally -PRON- warn -PRON- when the procedure may be a bit sensitive be patient and kind and
-PRON- could not have ask for a good experience or result
jane be a one of a kind a gem an artist and an expert in -PRON- craft
-PRON- as -PRON- say earlier be a treasure
one that -PRON- be really really happy and thankful that -PRON- find
-PRON- will be go back and refer all -PRON- friend
if -PRON- be stay at the mgm and -PRON- be on the way to the pool area to do some chillaxin stop by this little smoothie mix liquor bar
-PRON- have fluorescent color pina coladas daiquiris and margaritas
ooh and do not forget about the jello shot
please note refill be cheap if -PRON- buy the souveni glass from the get go a la new oh len 's hurricanes
-PRON- usually do not partake in such girlie man drink but when do the status quo apply in the city of lost wages
go to 32 degrees get an alcoholic slushie and pass out at the pool
but do not forget -PRON- sunscreen
this place be so good
-PRON- have the pozole and the sopaipilla for breakfast
-PRON- be all so flavorful and authentic
-PRON- also have a side of bean and the green chile
-PRON- be one of the good thing -PRON- have have in a while
-PRON- service be also spectacular
-PRON- make -PRON- feel at home and come by to make sure -PRON- love the food
love this place
will definitely be back
-PRON- come here for the first time with a friend for a quick snack pull in by the sign for $ 1 oyster
the hostess be very friendly and seat -PRON- promptly with menu as soon as -PRON- enter
however -PRON- be not approach for at least 10 minute result in -PRON- friend have to flag down a waitress after -PRON- decide what to order
other than that the service be pleasant and efficient though -PRON- do not stay very long
the oyster be pretty small but for $ 1 -PRON- guess -PRON- can not really complain
-PRON- also order the shrimp udon salad which be pretty tasty with -PRON- wasabi dressing
the creamy potato croquette come fresh out of the fryer and arrive super hot
-PRON- be delicious with -PRON- crunchy outer shell and creamy inside with corn niblet
the decor be modern and the location be convenient
-PRON- will be come back to try other thing off the menu
excellent choice for vegan
great menu and nice atmosphere
mother of all creperie
service be good too
very fresh ingredient
lot of choice
this place be crepe heaven
very beautiful atmosphere with fantastic view
go for the weekend brunch which be really tasty
-PRON- have one of the breakfast sandwich that have a nice jam spread and a prickly pear mimosa
-PRON- can not wait to return for sure to try more thing off of -PRON- menu
the original bbq chicken pizza eh
normally not -PRON- thing but since -PRON- be -PRON- specialty -PRON- give -PRON- a go
-PRON- have have -PRON- before but this be the first time dining in
overall the pizza be good
but be -PRON- just -PRON- or have the pizza get a lot small while the price go up
not only that but now -PRON- have to pay an extra $ 3 for bacon which be always an include topping
-PRON- would not spend $ 20 on a pizza that would serve one person of average appetite very often
good pizza but terrible value way overpriced and very small portion
order the $ 10 thursday special and the pizza be amazing
fresh and hot
the person that take -PRON- order be friendly
will definitely come back if -PRON- do not live so far
get the mac and cheese burrito jackfruit taco and the nachos
the burrito be super satisfying fairly greasy drunk food
feel like -PRON- need a sharp taste to offset all the starch but overall quite good
the jackfruit taco have a delicious soft tortilla and the faux meat be good but a little on the plain side
the rice and bean that come with the taco be in desperate need of season
now onto the nachos amazing
be vegan for 18 year and these be by far the good -PRON- have ever have
-PRON- omnivore friend be also impressed
what -PRON- would assume be homemade chip drown in bean guac and vegan sour cream
totally sinful
in summation far from complex culinary excellence but definitely yummy guilty pleasure vegan mexican food that -PRON- would definitely frequent again
-PRON- be starve and between errand so stop in for a quick chicken fry rice
disgusting
there be zero flavor
-PRON- add three pack of soy sauce to make -PRON- taste like something
the chicken have a grayish color and no carrot pea or egg
only bean sprout and onion -PRON- eat about a quarter of -PRON- and pitch -PRON-
never again
how hard be fry rice
this be -PRON- favorite music venue in phoenix
-PRON- be a small venue best for local or indie band but every show -PRON- have be to -PRON- have be far more memorable then any show -PRON- have be to in phoenix
the place -PRON- be not too stunning -PRON- be just a rectangular brick building with a bar area on the right when -PRON- walk in booth on the left side of the wall some high table in the middle a stage and standing area at the back and an eclectic mix of art on the wall
however the place have a really good feel to -PRON- and excellent sound that lead to really wild and memorable concert
the two that i remember the most be the presets\/the rapture and spinto band\/art brut\/we be scientist
i think the preset be pretty lousy until i see -PRON- play there and the rapture play an absolutely amazing set that last almost 2 hour and inspire an epic comfortably out of control dance party
the other show be equally long and boisterous highlight by eddie argo come out into the crowd to sing 3 song
the bad thing about the place be that last time i go there be still no alcohol because -PRON- lose -PRON- liquor license
however i hear that -PRON- have get -PRON- back now but -PRON- be not sure
the show i go to i have to go down the street between set and drink at alice cooperstown which be not cheap
-PRON- also do not have a patio at all where -PRON- can hang out and hear the music or what be go on inside and drink or smoke
the venue remind -PRON- alot of the lounge in the back of plush in tucson except for the lack of a patio which be really important in a state like az where the weather be so good at night most of the year
of course the bad thing be just the lack of band that go there
most band come to either marquee heaven help -PRON- poor phoenician or even bad the clubhouse
if -PRON- happen to be a tour manager reading review on yelp please book -PRON- band at the brickhouse
update 8\/31 have to downgrade to 4 star after -PRON- most recent visit
-PRON- hard to believe that -PRON- be downgrade -PRON- now that -PRON- have liquor available but -PRON- be happen
-PRON- normally have local draft brew at this place for 2 dollar but apparently when -PRON- have a show -PRON- do not sell -PRON- at all
only bottle for 3 or 4 dollar
what be bad be that every bottle -PRON- order be not cold taste like -PRON- just throw -PRON- in the ice bin 30 minute before
and -PRON- keep run out of beer
what be even bad be that the mixed drink run 6 dollar for a really tiny glass
this place need to get -PRON- act together
-PRON- will be drink beforehand and elsewhere in between set from now on
-PRON- do not get why the music venue in phoenix do not understand how much more money -PRON- can make at a show with drink special
-PRON- also apparently have not invest in air conditioning which make summer show not even worth -PRON-
okkervil river still put on a great show to -PRON- surprise which be the only thing along with the other great show -PRON- have see there that keep -PRON- downgrade this place to 3 star or low
-PRON- be also in the middle of remodeling so the place look kindof like crap right now
darling place
while -PRON- be too late in the day for coffee for -PRON- -PRON- love that -PRON- serve organic coffee
-PRON- seem difficult to find that
-PRON- have the carnita taco and -PRON- be delicious and satisfying
look forward to try this place again in the future
-PRON- come here for the first time yesterday for lunch
very friendly staff and great atmosphere
-PRON- sit at the bar and joe joseph take great care of -PRON-
-PRON- have some wonderful recommendations- one be -PRON- house make sangria which -PRON- order and -PRON- be delicious
-PRON- make -PRON- with on tap white wine fresh squeezed lemonade and some other ingredient -PRON- can not recall
but -PRON- be very refreshing and tasty
for food -PRON- order -PRON- chicken salad sandwich which be incredible
highly recommend this place
-PRON- will definitely be back with co worker for lunch another day or after work drink
giant rustic rip off
sorry
-PRON- hate leave negative review but be not impressed
at
all
cute little place with rustic decor but the food be less than impressive
think of the pizza place in the airport where -PRON- order a $ 10 salad that be not even make fresh to order
that s a deal breaker for -PRON-
-PRON- order the italian salad which be decent but not worth $ 10
pizza be ok
more on the dry side with cispy crunchy crust
not bad but again way over price
$ 41 for 2 salad and a cheese pizza if -PRON- be not picky about pre make salad -PRON- may enjoy try one
-PRON- could have just get lucky but -PRON- just seriously get the good damn burger and good fry -PRON- have ever eat at an airport
what a pleasant surprise
-PRON- find most french restaurant too stiff and stick up although -PRON- be not a stranger to french dining
l'atelier be surprising chic and modern without lack the elegance expect from joel robuchon
this be a petite restaurant with a relax atmosphere still the crowd come dress in -PRON- good vegas look
bar side seating be for two since table be reserve for large party
no worry the red decor have no resemblance to a cheap chinese restaurant
only french luxury
-PRON- only disappointed be that the restaurant be locate at the mgm grand
-PRON- be justly simple become a ghetto hotel
the cuisine be exceptional
smoke salmon foie grais sea bass and lobster
yes
the good lobster ever
the service be above and beyond
-PRON- original dish be not what -PRON- expect and -PRON- make -PRON- a new one
what can -PRON- say
-PRON- be very happy with the experience
this place be really delicious and be the perfect place for a quick lunch or a random snack
the salmon sandwich be flavorful and cook perfectly the iced tea be brew to perfection and the chip be crunchy salty and delicious
-PRON- go here after -PRON- get to the hotel and be wait for -PRON- room to be ready -PRON- check in early
-PRON- do not disappoint
-PRON- favorite go to tex mex restaurant
the food and service be always amazing
-PRON- would recommend make a reservation on weekend because -PRON- do get very busy
the taco be delicious and pack with a lot
the tequila flight be great as well
-PRON- go here a while ago with -PRON- cousin for lunch hop to get some fresh seafood and delicious entree
unfortunately the service be beyond terrible and the food be no good
-PRON- waitress continuously pass by and never check up on -PRON- and continue to chit chat with fellow co worker
in addition the chicken dish -PRON- order be dry and expensive for such a small portion
while -PRON- be there another customer also complain to the staff that -PRON- service be terrible and -PRON- food be cold
-PRON- ask for the manager and -PRON- promptly tell -PRON- that -PRON- be not available
after the woman leave the waiter -PRON- be talk to roll -PRON- eye and start talk crap about the lady not two minute after -PRON- walk out
as the staff continue to gossip and talk crap -PRON- cousin
and -PRON- be still be ignore and thus -PRON- walk out
this be also the first time -PRON- have ever be to a joe 's and -PRON- will be -PRON- last
be there ever a time at any point of any year when edinburgh waverley do not have some sort of engineering work or scaffolding or general work go on
no probably not
do this distract from how much -PRON- love this station as national hub of travel
nope
edinburgh waverley be a great train station with a plethora of platform all the amenity -PRON- would expect in a station from burger king to whsmith and wait room galore
-PRON- have be come and go from\/to this train station for the past 3 year as -PRON- partner colin be from dunfermline and this be -PRON- sort of halfway point
well -PRON- be when -PRON- live in fife
the station be huge and sometimes -PRON- can take -PRON- nearly 5 minute to walk from one platform to another one so watch -PRON- departure time but the staff be always lovely and happy to help or direct -PRON- from wherever to wherever else
-PRON- only problem with this station be that as of recently costa be go
costa be go
where else be -PRON- suppose to get delicious smoothie drink before -PRON- train journey waverley
so who be skeptical about place with really high review and who be a pain and bring 3 very different picture of hairstyle and have trouble commit to just one
well if -PRON- be like -PRON- then this place be great for -PRON-
-PRON- really be a 5 place
-PRON- feel very relaxed because sam stylist extraordinaire put -PRON- at ease
-PRON- look at all of the picture and help -PRON- make the good possible decision for -PRON- hair

there be several thing that go wrong here and because of this experience -PRON- will never have a party outside of -PRON- home
this year -PRON- be not plan on throw -PRON- daughter -PRON- party as -PRON- dad want to this year
well unexpectedly -PRON- be no longer able to do so
and -PRON- be give a month notice of this
on march 15th -PRON- book an opening at the play factory and problem 1 happen
-PRON- receive a call either later that day or the follow say -PRON- be not able to have -PRON- party at that time because -PRON- be book already
umm then why be -PRON- able to book -PRON- online
also -PRON- have be look at -PRON- option for a week and this slot have be open throughout that week as well
not to mention the voicemail that be leave be just terrible
so -PRON- call back and let -PRON- know this be very inconvenient for -PRON- since -PRON- have send out the invitation to be make already and have set up an event on facebook with that time
-PRON- be tell after a brief hold that -PRON- would be get -PRON- price cut to half of the total the total be give to -PRON- online after book because -PRON- have already select everything -PRON- want in regard to food and extra
-PRON- think okay terrific
-PRON- be willing to work with -PRON- -PRON- will continue -PRON- service there
a few day go by and -PRON- come across yelp -PRON- read the review and be just horrified -PRON- begin to get worried that -PRON- daughter party be go to be a disaster
so -PRON- call the manager jessie who -PRON- go over a list with of thing -PRON- want to do or take to make sure -PRON- be okay to do so
-PRON- also ask -PRON- if -PRON- s aware of the review on yelp and seem rather annoyed to hear -PRON- say this
-PRON- say yes to all of -PRON- request over the phone but once the day come -PRON- know nothing be write out for -PRON-
before -PRON- get to the actual day of the party -PRON- also want to point out that -PRON- make the drive there a couple week before the actual date to see the place and go over everything with the staff
-PRON- arrive and -PRON- could not find -PRON- reservation
why
well -PRON- be put down for an incorrect time slot
imagine if -PRON- would have never go in to check in
the manager be call and -PRON- say the time could be move to where -PRON- should have be per phone call
okay great also -PRON- ask how long in advance can -PRON- be there to help decorate for the party
-PRON- even explain that -PRON- be big on d.i.y decoration and have several little thing that need attention before the party begin
these two boy tell -PRON- -PRON- would be able to get there as early as an hour because there be no other party reserve and because of the confusion with the reservation time
okay great
-PRON- leave think the trip there should have smooth everything out for the party forget the bad review
the party be go to be great
the day arrive -PRON- call 35 minute before the party time to see if thing be okay and to le -PRON-
know -PRON- be on the way and due to the rain and traffic
-PRON- would be late
hang up and call back once -PRON- get off the freeway and be around the corner
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- be still try to get people out
-PRON- ask for -PRON- help and -PRON- say -PRON- would be out with a cart
-PRON- arrive no cart noone wait after 10 minute of be outside -PRON- go inside and one be surprised about -PRON- request
-PRON- grab the cart and head down for the thing to -PRON- car with one of the girl trail behind -PRON-
once -PRON- grab everything -PRON- go inside and -PRON- be 10 minute untill -PRON- party time or less and there be still people inside for open play table dirty floor a mess thing out of place
finally everyone be out and -PRON- have to move the table -PRON-
then -PRON- friend show up and if -PRON- be not for -PRON- -PRON- would have be so much bad
the staff member have zero pep in there step
one take -PRON- time vacuum another take -PRON- time with computer
-PRON- let -PRON- know right off the bat -PRON- need help with labeling set up the table set up the balloon set up the special decoration -PRON- make
-PRON- friend help -PRON- with most of this
4 guest arrive while -PRON- be still decorate
so throughout the party there be no one available for the rock climbing wall and -PRON- have to be on -PRON- back about what -PRON- order
i.e-
hey -PRON- have this for snack extra balloon etc
-PRON- have the manager call so much because the girl be clueless about -PRON- special request the one i speak with with the manager directly
-PRON- could tell -PRON- be fluster and keep tell -PRON- to relax and enjoy the party but how could -PRON-
everything be behind schedule and -PRON- be not do anything but wait for -PRON- to command something of -PRON-
the manager be aware of this craziness go on and refuse to give -PRON- a good price to extend the party further
let -PRON- shorten this up -PRON- have to end up pay so much more than what -PRON- be tell because -PRON- have no proof of the conversation -PRON- have when -PRON- be give the half off quote because of the inconvenience
the manager be call again and -PRON- be annoy and pass -PRON- over to -PRON- wife
the price only get high and high
the target be alright usually clean and the worker be mostly helpful
the cvs on the other hand not so good
cvs be actually whom -PRON- have be with since day 1 and -PRON- switch to the target cvs because -PRON- be close
bad decision ever
-PRON- be not happy with be there
and -PRON- can see -PRON-
-PRON- feel bad but also -PRON- not professional
hop that cvs corp intervene and help -PRON- out
small cafe with excellent or should -PRON- say egg cellent and creative omelette
also very good coffee include the horchata latte which taste like dessert

a bit of small town charm in big old scottsdale
very quaint little french bistro
-PRON- go for brunch one saturday
alexi be -PRON- waitress friendly definitely a people person
-PRON- order the delicious ham bacon and cheese quiche which come with a garden salad and fry potato
mr. o'zandra have the smoked salmon open faced sandwich
-PRON- be still talk about -PRON-
great experience
-PRON- will return for dinner for sure
great service very professional and prompt process -PRON- highly recommend to -PRON- friend and family
one of the good breakfast place in the valley hand down
-PRON- book a reservation for 8:45 am on mother 's day and get right in yay
employee be extremely friendly personable and accommodate
check up on -PRON- just the right amount
-PRON- be -PRON- family of 4 that din in
-PRON- order hot mama a tad spicy which -PRON- like -PRON- have eggs benedict -PRON- son have blueberry hill pancakes and -PRON- also have -PRON- baby who do not order
the orange juice be delicious and also the hot chocolate -PRON- know -PRON- be summertime in phoenix
the food be unbelievable worth what -PRON- be ask
-PRON- bill be $ 38
-PRON- be also very active on social medium with -PRON- fb fan page and twitter which appeal to -PRON-
-PRON- guarantee -PRON- will not be disappoint
food suck even for bar food wing be horrible along with -PRON- fry food and stay away from fry and mac n cheese -PRON- do have some good special on whiskey only good thing about this place
-PRON- do not go into a mcdonalds expect bobby flay burger
with that say -PRON- have some pretty high expectation for this store
-PRON- know -PRON- be still -PRON- typical starbucks but -PRON- be not ready for what happen
how can -PRON- cal this a reserve store
be not this suppose to be a shin example of -PRON- ability
from the clover machine still break 3 week later to the pour over intend to replace the clover
after -PRON- 10 minute wait
the start -PRON- drink
after -PRON- 20 minute wait -PRON- get -PRON- drink
barista be rude coffee be two sip and in the garbage -PRON- get two different coffee one ethiopian and one honduras
-PRON- could not tell the two apart and -PRON- cup coffee all day long
this store be filthy
absolutely dirty in every corner from the restroom to the table
there be wear mark all over the handle and railing
-PRON- get to witness the staff weigh out coffee use a scoop instead of a scale
seriously
starbucks should pull the r from this store
-PRON- be run more poorly than many of -PRON- typical store
eliminate the rude uncaring and mediocre at good staff and start from the ground up
call -PRON- what -PRON- be fast food quality coffee
skip this
go to bent tree instead
there be only so much rice and chicken that -PRON- can actually eat until -PRON- get sick of -PRON-
-PRON- be super excited about go to halal guys
-PRON- have hear about this chain base off in new york and how people be rave about how good the chicken and rice combo be
when -PRON- get there -PRON- be clean and kinda set up like a fusion between chipotle and five guy
-PRON- get the large chicken and gyro combo and -PRON- definitely give -PRON- pretty reasonable portion here
-PRON- be able to choose some additional condiment to add to -PRON- rice plate as well as if -PRON- want to add a sauce to -PRON-
of course -PRON- recommend to add the white sauce which be a fusion between a plain yogurt and ranch dress
the plate -PRON- get be good
there be not anything to rave about when -PRON- come to -PRON- chicken though
-PRON- can seriously get some more flavorful chicken at place like let -PRON- say panda express of yogi grill
the basmati rice be good however by -PRON- be a little bland
that be what the sauce be for
overall -PRON- be most likely not go to come back here for awhile
service be excellent however the kind of mediterranean\/greek influence style food be alright
-PRON- feel -PRON- can get good taste of gyro and stuff at actual greek restaurant etc
but then again maybe -PRON- just do not crave this kind of food
tips 1 do not get too much of that red hot sauce
-PRON- be super spicy
-PRON- will suffer if -PRON- put too much on -PRON- rice 2 get a normal rice plate should definitely be enough to fill -PRON- up
first off do not listen to the other bad review
-PRON- be -PRON- first time ever go to a sport clip and -PRON- get treat very well by a sweet girl name amberley
-PRON- would 100 refer someone to that sport clip location
-PRON- would also recommend get the work do by amberly
-PRON- be one very satisfied customer and will be back
-PRON- go in this adorable shop to get some monogram stationary and
whoa
this place be incredible
the staff be super friendly and knowledgeable and everything be so beautiful -PRON- want to move in
these guy be the good
polite and professional technician
knowledgable and helpful sale people and support staff
-PRON- have be patronize brewers for 20 + year
mark ibarra and tim riley be the good team -PRON- could hope for to meet -PRON- comfort need
this be -PRON- favorite location out of any -PRON- have be to
-PRON- dine in and take out frequently and justin be the good when -PRON- get take out
-PRON- highly recommend dana park the food consistency great service and cleanliness be above many other location -PRON- have visit
-PRON- will not have to chase anyone down to get the thing -PRON- need like napkin refill or -PRON- bill
keep up the good work
okay -PRON- be super excited about this place when -PRON- finally realize what -PRON- be while -PRON- be in the drive through
-PRON- be not excited however about -PRON- complicated menu
-PRON- do the build -PRON- own combo thing
and -PRON- just want a single patty cheeseburger with bacon on -PRON-
-PRON- get the cheese curd as a side because well how could -PRON- not
fried cheese
after pull past the pay window -PRON- wait for a good 7 10 minute for -PRON- food
that be irritate
-PRON- like the whole make to order thing but jack in the box manage to do -PRON- faster
-PRON- gobble up all -PRON- cheese curd within moment
ya -PRON- be really good
there be a mix of white and yellow cheese in there
the flavor of -PRON- be just delicious
unfortunately -PRON- burger be all sort of wrong
-PRON- open the wrapping to find a ridiculously misshapen double cheeseburger inside
-PRON- want one less patty and some bacon
-PRON- guess that be too much to ask
anyway -PRON- look unappetizing base off of the strangely shape patty and the fact that -PRON- be so greasy
-PRON- could not get -PRON- hand to grip -PRON- without crap fall out the other end
-PRON- probably would not go back unless -PRON- be just get a snack
the cheese curd be great but that be about -PRON-
excellent
muy rico
fresh flavor excellent service
highly recommend if -PRON- live here or be visit phoenix area as -PRON- be
return call promptly arrive on time and within ~24 hour of -PRON- first call
very clear estimate and explanation
price be right
for a home that be almost entirely tile the disruption be minimal
mark be very polite and professional put up with -PRON- incessantly bark dog
work be fast and effective on light very textur tile light grout that have be in place unsealed and never professionally clean since 2000
-PRON- just look up the actual receipt from the floor contractor
highly recommend
sears be know for two things- appliance and the reliable auto center
-PRON- be a customer with -PRON- ford explorer year prior btw at the meadows location
since -PRON- come after dinner time on a monday evening there be just a few customer ahead of -PRON- so -PRON- be assist in a timely manner
-PRON- need a new battery for -PRON- pt cruiser
chrysler have a habit of situate the battery underneath another part like the air filter for example so for the cost of the die hard battery $ 79.99 with a 1.5 year warranty
prorate for 6 year plus the installation fee of $ 12.99 reasonable cost and tax the total be $ 100.67 no core charge
the alternative be a pro start battery with a year warranty $ 49.99
but -PRON- do not sound like the csr believe in -PRON- be a little hesitant in -PRON- offering
-PRON- be just a little weird that there be a display of tire directly behind the line for the cashier there should be a define line- tape on the floor or something which create an awkward line around the tire display
-PRON- guess -PRON- would have to be there in order to understand what -PRON- be say
-PRON- pull into the garage for express service
there be a small waiting room with chair some vend machine a trash can and a tv
since there be a customer ahead of -PRON- and -PRON- would be a few minute -PRON- walk to the mall and browse a few store and get a new watch battery too love when -PRON- get thing do
-PRON- ask -PRON- to call -PRON- when -PRON- be do
there be another customer in front of -PRON- before checkout
so -PRON- be a few minute
but another rep help -PRON- and -PRON- pay for -PRON- go off on -PRON- merry way
during the daytime the place be swamp
usually there be a line of about ten people
so if -PRON- want to avoid the crowd get there in the evening
good lunch spot in west mifflin hand down
great price and great food except the tuna salad
daily special be always good and a nice place to sit down and eat
cool small and -PRON- mean small
unique place
the menu consist of a boatload aka good selection of beer and wine write on the chalk board
this can make -PRON- a little difficult to figure out what -PRON- want at time but the bartender tend to know -PRON- stuff and can help -PRON- out with ordering
-PRON- color code the beer base on broad style as well
anyway when this place be get go -PRON- can be a real ball -PRON- will get to know the people next to -PRON- if -PRON- want can play a bunch of random game such as battleship with -PRON- fellow bar goer and order some light appetizer if -PRON- so please
there be no other bar quite like the whining pig definitely a place to check out at least once to experience for -PRON-
be from pennsylvania-
-PRON- struggle with find pizza out here in az that satisfy -PRON- craving for ny style pizza
this place absolutely do the job
-PRON- will absolutely become a regular
blueberry hill never disappoint
-PRON- have be come here as long as -PRON- can remember
probably because -PRON- mom be a waitress here for 15 year when -PRON- move to vegas in 1990
although some of the server be not as attentive as -PRON- could be -PRON- be all very friendly the food be what keep -PRON- come back
this place be fast and very economical
-PRON- be quote $ 1600 for a catalytic converter by another mechanic and -PRON- do -PRON- with after market part for $ 500 the same day with no appointment on -PRON- 2008 nissan altima
impressive and friendly service
in this particular area there be a tonne of shop sell quirky t shirt with witty slogan adorn -PRON-
liberation be another one to add to the list and -PRON- can not say that -PRON- stand out anymore than the rest -PRON- just seem to blend in with all the other bizarre shop on cockburn st. -PRON- can imagine that this place will do a roaring trade during the fringe with punter come into buy silly souvenir for back home
a few of the slogan -PRON- see be
-PRON- be just jealous because the little voice be talk to -PRON-
sarcasm be just one of the service that -PRON- offer
hil arious
-PRON- have a dental emergency and be able to get an appointment the follow day
dr ream be unavailable but dr. buzzatto hold -PRON- appointment and be extremely professional and fix -PRON- up in no time
everyone in the office be very pleasant and helpful
-PRON- would recommend -PRON-
pat
nice thing to do in vegas
nice view nice ride nice employee
probably will not do -PRON- again
-PRON- be great to have a decent burger joint around markham
five guy have -PRON- characteristic diner decor with the usual food court table and chair which be keep pretty clean for how messy the burger can get because -PRON- stuff a lot of topping in the burger and -PRON- be bind to make a mess while eat
-PRON- have long find -PRON- give -PRON- much big portion than -PRON- would expect
-PRON- always order the small fry because as -PRON- turn out -PRON- just fill the paper bag with fry anyway regardless of what size -PRON- be
the difference between a junior and a regular burger be 1 vs 2 patty and -PRON- be more than full with a junior burger
fountain drink be self serve and refillable which be always great
and of course free peanut
the only downfall homeless ppl in and out of the facility beg for food
-PRON- would not mind help out with food or money but not while -PRON- be eat
the food be soso
-PRON- have have good at cici
-PRON- want to use -PRON- amex and discover card to get the most points\/cash back as possible and this place only accept visa and master card
-PRON- ask the owner and -PRON- say -PRON- be too expensive to accept -PRON-
funny because the cashier say many people come in try to use -PRON- amex card
-PRON- call the location on tropicana and eastern and -PRON- be very nice and say -PRON- accept all card
-PRON- will not be back to this location
the only thing good about this location be wiley
ambiance
3 there be quite a bit of seating but the place seem rather unorganized
-PRON- be very cafeteria esque
service 3 the service be okay but not great
-PRON- be fast to get -PRON- order but slow to bring out the food
food 2
a lot of the food be already prepare so -PRON- do not really seem that fresh
-PRON- get a rice plate with duck and pork and -PRON- be actually a bit cold to the touch
-PRON- be not too amazing and not something that -PRON- would frequent often
however -PRON- do hear that the soup\/noodle be the good thing on the menu and the thing worth eat there
-PRON- do not get to try that
i'm not a big fan of soup
so if -PRON- be plan to eat there -PRON- could see if all the rumor be true
-PRON- have be come here for probably as long as this location have be open
-PRON- be not a fancy place but the food be pretty good
-PRON- be as similar to home cooking by mom or grandma as a restaurant can get
breakfast be -PRON- favorite time to eat here
the sausage gravy be the good ever
there be many breakfast option and -PRON- be all great with large portion and great price
dinner option can be pretty awesome too
the turkey dinner and the meatloaf be great
-PRON- can remember get these as takeout in college for something similar to home cooking
for a simple inexpensive meal this be great option
-PRON- be super picky about get -PRON- nail do since -PRON- be ocd and be that -PRON- have a personal nail varnish inventory that would rival any salon 's -PRON- prefer to do -PRON- own
-PRON- be however great to know that there be place like nailsense that be super clean wonderfully polite and proper efficient
the salon -PRON- look almost clinical with a sterile white tile interior but -PRON- will tell -PRON- something
-PRON- do not see one speck of dust there and absolutely no noxious smell at all which instantly put -PRON- ocd meter in relax mode
-PRON- manicurist kim be super polite and get down to business get -PRON- nail do
the cuticle work be pristine
-PRON- be usually terribly flinchy when -PRON- be get the perimeter cuticle snip and be that -PRON- cuticle pain threshold be very low
-PRON- will usually watch like a hawk during this process but kim 's touch be so fast and painless that -PRON- be completely unaware while -PRON- breeze along in conversation with the hostess of the yelp nailsense event the lovely roma
-PRON- would like to comment about people who complain about the lack of small talk between -PRON- and the esthetician really be that necessary
-PRON- guess -PRON- be not bother by silence during beauty procedure
these people be professional and especially be asians -PRON- have a tendancy to be focus on do good work instead of say talk about which private doggie school be good for train -PRON- teacup poodle
besides be not small talk what -PRON- friend or therapist be for
-PRON- one caveat be that the manicurist do not understand -PRON- request for oval vs squaoval shape nail imo oval shaped nail incur the least amount of chip and look less like stripper nail but -PRON- be so impressed with the cuticle work and massage that -PRON- let -PRON- fly
okay -PRON- have two caveat
but -PRON- be no fault of nailsense and more of a personal quirk
why
why oh why be there always chick flick play at nail joint
-PRON- be wait for the day -PRON- can watch nba playoff or maybe lock stock and two smokin barrel instead of this obnoxious fluff
that day -PRON- watch what happen in vegas
yuck
-PRON- must say -PRON- be shock at how amazing the pricing be at nailsense consider this be lawrence $ $ $ park a regular manicure will cost $ 15
that be like scarborough pricing but without the ghettoness and attitude
nailsense -PRON- have pass -PRON- white gloved ocd test and -PRON- pricing within reach and great service have win -PRON- approval
no this be not nonsense -PRON- be nailsense dammit and -PRON- like -PRON-
for a national chain in an airport -PRON- do a pretty decent job
whether -PRON- be fly in or out there be not a whole lot of time to sit down for a long dining experience
this be why -PRON- see so many grab and go place in any terminal
for someone like -PRON- -PRON- always get where -PRON- need to be way ahead of time
-PRON- have plenty of time to relax even if service be slow
this location of chilis be probably one of the quick service and food preparation -PRON- have experience
there be no need to worry about time
-PRON- food taste just like any other chilis
service be friendly and fast
-PRON- be pleasantly surprised
-PRON- certainly appreciate the efficiency
after get check in on may 18 10:45am
-PRON- head up to room 3082
-PRON- be stay here for 2 night and be check out on may 20
the room -PRON- be clean with some minor issue the outlet between the night stand have an alarm clock and lamp plug in with no other outlet to charge -PRON- phone which result in unplug both thing so -PRON- -PRON- friend could plug -PRON- phone in at night
silverton need to update the lamp so -PRON- have plug on -PRON-
the bathroom could use some updating like add a light in the shower stall as -PRON- be dark while -PRON- take a bath or shower but overall i be glad -PRON- be clean
-PRON- love how -PRON- offer 2 bottle of water in -PRON- room at a $ 4 fee which be helpful as there be not many store other then the 2 gas station across the street
there be some problem with the wifi both night -PRON- ipad phone and mac would disconnect every 5 minute which result -PRON- have to reconnect
silverado should have separate wifi for the hotel like other hotel on the strip
-PRON- do call housekeeping on may 19 8:30 to let -PRON- know -PRON- can clean -PRON- room
but -PRON- take till 3 p.m. to come by and clean after -PRON- be tell on the phone -PRON- will come before 9 a.m.
-PRON- will most likely not come and stay here as -PRON- be very far from the strip
but -PRON- do have to say -PRON- be a nice little hotel with crackle barrel and bass pro shop within the casino floor
pros free parking valet clean rooms shuttle to airport aria town square
cons
no fridge microwave or coffee marker far from strip
house keeping take to long
no outlet near night stand bad wifi service
this be the bad experience -PRON- have have at a restaurant to date
20 minute to get coffee
1st round refill
hahaha
-PRON- must be joke
then -PRON- food come 40 minute later
the biscuit and gravy be cold
the waffle be cold
the bacon be undercooked take -PRON- chance on get that fix but when -PRON- ask the server for fully cook bacon -PRON- take -PRON- back and throw -PRON- in the microwave not what -PRON- have in mind when -PRON- get that chance to ask for new fully cook bacon what -PRON- get be burn to a crisp apparently the staff here have a sense of humor
oh and -PRON- be charge again for the replacement
-PRON- just suck to go in somewhere without much expectation and still be disappointed
-PRON- would not waste -PRON- time if -PRON- be think about this location
crocker park represent the late trend of suburban america the outdoor mall
the outdoor mall 's goal be to mimic a large urban shopping district in the middle of the bub or slightly rural area outside of the actual hustle and bustle of major urban center
while -PRON- like a lot of the store within crocker park -PRON- attempt to recreate an urban shopping district as with the other outdoor mall like -PRON- completely miss the mark
first there be nothing unique about crocker park
-PRON- provide for some great shopping but only if -PRON- want to visit the same store -PRON- can find everywhere else sometimes only 10 mile further down the road
one of the element that make urban shopping district great be the unique store
while h&m and banana republic be good in -PRON- own right there be few small boutique store offer special reason to visit the location versus just go to any other mall
even urban shopping district have the major chain but the little unique spot in between be what make those district special and a treat to visit
crocker park also suffer from overly deliberate design
the flow of traffic the design of the building and the development phase at which the living option stretch outward from apartment to townhous be all far too deliberate and force
-PRON- be do not feel like an urban shopping district -PRON- just feel like a mall with road
-PRON- feel so much like a mall that -PRON- commonly see pedestrian and motorist alike disregard common traffic safety rule -PRON- do not seem to realize this be not a parking lot but actual street where traffic law still apply
there be no quirk that stem from historical matter involve in the development of the area over the life of a city like -PRON- find with urban shopping district
while -PRON- be hard to create the quirk of the historical progression of a city little insignificant planning error here and there a few change in architectural period styling include a few building height difference and other small alteration would be nice in add a unique flavor into an outdoor mall
that could be enough to make -PRON- feel like an urban shopping district
currently all the building flow exactly the same and with the same height
-PRON- be boring
the way the development phase shift from two level with store on the bottom and apartment on top then to condo and town home behind the mall do not feel very urban either
-PRON- feel like a stereotypical suburban housing development that stem off a brand new strip mall
this method of expansion design phase further solidify the fake feeling this place provide
there be plenty of good shopping here and the place be wonderfully clean and safe but -PRON- be just a mall
-PRON- be outdoor just mean -PRON- have to endure the cold when shop at this mall during the winter
this forced urban shopping district design provide a place for suburbanite to play pretend for a moment and think of city live in a relatively homogenize development
-PRON- do not have any disdain for the suburb and the resident of these locality
-PRON- just think croker park fail to truthfully mimic the urban shopping district in any meaningful way
perhaps the generic outdoor mall versus a real urban shopping district be exactly what suburbanite want
-PRON- will go go to croker park on occasion and -PRON- will experience good shopping but not to the degree
-PRON- feel the planner architect and developer want to create
-PRON- grooming dept butcher -PRON- dog
do not bring -PRON- dog here
-PRON- call -PRON- and the -PRON- have never call -PRON- back
-PRON- bring -PRON- dog in for a shave because -PRON- coat get mat goldendoodle
-PRON- happen quick
-PRON- come back with razor burn as -PRON- would -PRON- do not oil -PRON- clipper
and now the tiny cut be scabb over and cause -PRON- a lot of pain
-PRON- tell -PRON- this and -PRON- do not respond
after see a billboard claim to have the good pancake -PRON- decide to give -PRON- a try
-PRON- daughter have the pancake around $ 10 and -PRON- be really good
-PRON- have the omelette around $ 14 which be good
-PRON- come with a choice of muffin
-PRON- go with blueberry but -PRON- be really dry
-PRON- feel that -PRON- be pricey
and -PRON- feel there be good place for breakfast
the reason for 2 star be that the service be horrible
-PRON- be not busy when -PRON- go total of about 10 people in the restaurant
-PRON- wait a long time for -PRON- drink order refill and food
there be plenty of worker just stand around include the manager
katsuya have very good customer service -PRON- accommodate to what -PRON- need and be very happy to help
the portion be large -PRON- can probably share the katsu with a friend
-PRON- recommend this place if -PRON- want to try out new way to eat -PRON- katsu
and -PRON- also offer free soup salad and rice
the customer service be alright but when -PRON- get -PRON- truck back -PRON- notice -PRON- tire pressure be still off
when -PRON- bring -PRON- truck in -PRON- have some off tire pressure and nothing be change when -PRON- leave
-PRON- show -PRON- nobody actually read the tire pressure which lead -PRON- to think of what else be overlook
not a happy customer

location be good
seating be mean to be unpleasant to make -PRON- leave asap

-PRON- have the swordfish and jerk rice combo
no flavor in that meal which be very surprising for jerk food
-PRON- keep eat think -PRON- would get good but no such luck
-PRON- be pretty pricey for the quality of food be serve
-PRON- stop by here and on the exterior -PRON- seem okay
when -PRON- drive in the first thing -PRON- notice be people walk pit bull everywhere
-PRON- be think be this a dog park or apt complex
as -PRON- get the tour -PRON- be hard to believe this place be locate in the lakes and borderline to summerlin
but -PRON- be not worth a dime
the fitness room be a joke as be -PRON- pool area and the apartment be small dark and dreary and the entire place be absolutely outdated
clearly -PRON- be a place for those who own pit bull
but definitely not the place for -PRON-
the team at scottsdale cpa 's be truly amazing

the angus mini burger be good but again not anything totally special -PRON- love blue cheese so -PRON- think -PRON- like -PRON- a little good than most people because -PRON- have a strong blue cheese flavor
the service be fine
-PRON- seem like the main server be spread a little thin but -PRON- do a good job
-PRON- be kind of weird that a young woman come to -PRON- table and introduce -PRON- as the co server and then -PRON- see -PRON- just kind of hang out by the bar talk with coworker the whole night while -PRON- partner take every order and deal with all of the client
maybe -PRON- be not really a co server and just say -PRON- be to greet\/buy the main server some time

resto françai intéressant notamment pour les vin au prix de la saq
bon pas exactement au prix de la saq un peu plus élevé de quelqu $ $ seulement
rien de gastronomique dan la présentation définitivement plus bistro
la cuisse de canard était succulante quoique j'ai été surpris de la trouver servi sur un bout de fromage cheddar fondu
c' peut être pour garder la cuisse bien en place dan l'assiette
:-p
le cerf qui provient de la région était aussi très bon
a part la pièce de viande on nous a servi exactement les même légume
et l'assiette était présentée de facon similaire donc on repassera pour l'originalité
le pot de chocolat à la fleur de sel était bon en dessert difficile de ne pas aimer quand on aime les dessert
donc si vous passez par là n'ête
pas trop pressé
si vous y allez avant d'aller au cinéma qui est à 1 minute de là ca vaut le coup
da vinci be alive
except this time -PRON- be reincarnate as a chef and create the masterpiece call sushitto
sushi + burrito = one of those case where the whole be great than the sum of -PRON- part
this fusion be so legendary that -PRON- deserve -PRON- be own dragon ball z series

-PRON- want -PRON- to arrive 30 min before -PRON- appointment just to wait 2 hrs to see the doctor

-PRON- experience with the doctor have be great

now -PRON- be here in the office wait to be see by the doctor and want be to reschedule again due to the doctor leave the office
-PRON- stay and -PRON- take -PRON- back 2 hr later
-PRON- never receive the test result to the test -PRON- be refer out for by this office

-PRON- will go back the next time -PRON- be in markham which -PRON- hope be soon
bad experience ever
-PRON- make a reservation ahead of time for a special evening then call that afternoon to confirm -PRON- reservation and time

also -PRON- always see a coupon for 25 off one item in the 89012 coupon book
the store be very spacious but lay out very well
there be something to see everywhere
-PRON- must have spend a good half hour just do a loop make a mental note of all the item -PRON- want to come back to
-PRON- think any design style can find even a small knick knack or something for any crevice or cranny of -PRON- home that -PRON- do not want to leave without
-PRON- will probably go in every now and then to see what new item -PRON- have
-PRON- should grab -PRON- coupon and check -PRON- out
this place have really bad customer service food suck and expensive
food be not warm at all
avoid this place at all cost
there be ton of other good place around in commerce gate for cheap and good food
-PRON- would never return to a hotel that use scented febreeze in -PRON- room
-PRON- be thoughtless and stupid
-PRON- be offensive and unacceptable
-PRON- request one without before arrive
but -PRON- do not show up in -PRON- system
in any case there be no proof that even if -PRON- be not offensive that -PRON- be safe for -PRON- to breathe
why would anyone want to taste this in -PRON- mouth
-PRON- have nearly 1000 stay with hilton
this rarely happen but have happen more lately than ever

anyone who have taste real buttercream know that -PRON- be not as shelf stable or white as shorten frosting and taste like real butter
the chocolate cake have some kind of flavor in -PRON-
fake rum maybe
-PRON- really think people buy these cake because -PRON- do not know any better
perhaps the term buttercream be use loosely outside of europe but true buttercream be not a concoction of sweetex sweeten shortening commercial grade and some other fake ingredient
carl also be very stuck in -PRON- way when -PRON- come to design
-PRON- be not on the cutting edge -PRON- will only do certain design that -PRON- be be do since the 80
there will be no roll fondont ribbon or pulled sugar flower or bright color
if -PRON- want a simple cake and do not mind that -PRON- be frost with fake buttercream because that be what be more shelf stable and easy to work with then go to carl 's
-PRON- see that since -PRON- post -PRON- review deb r. from carl 's cakes comment
thank for -PRON- comment and those picture
-PRON- can definitely tell which one carl decorate as oppose to other cake decorator work there
the cake with a very simple pip design and love bird have carl write all over -PRON-
the cake that be more creative and interesting be do by other people
oh and -PRON- guy must go through a ton of shorten for all that buttercream
what a disappointment -PRON- be really look forward to try this place
all the great review for mediocre type of italian food
-PRON- be like eat at an expensive version of an olive garden with the same crappie food
do not know if maybe -PRON- be the wrong time or what
but -PRON- definitely expect a lot more out of -PRON-
come around 2:30pm
the price be never an issue for -PRON- as long as -PRON- give great quality food and authentic none of that here
-PRON- be super impressed with the quality
-PRON- recommend sin city mobile detail to everyone
-PRON- show up to -PRON- house within the timeframe give
no upcharge or hassle
great price and friendly people
-PRON- will use -PRON- again
keep up the great work
can -PRON- say super clean denali limo and professionalism second to none
that be exactly what -PRON- get when -PRON- use -PRON- awesome service
-PRON- pick -PRON- up on time cater to -PRON- need and -PRON- make a repeat customer out of -PRON- whenever -PRON- be in the area and in need of a limousine or sedan
find out -PRON- do party bus too
-PRON- may need a few more friend for that though
little to no line to get in
paid ~$30 during the holiday
-PRON- always have great service
but -PRON- do not like -PRON- when -PRON- want to take a picture of -PRON- when -PRON- come in who buy those picture
-PRON- may not be as good as bacchanal but -PRON- be totally worth a try
lot of selection
one of the good taco 's -PRON- have have in a long time
an addictive menu with delicious side -PRON- just eat here yesterday and -PRON- already want to eat here again
-PRON- would definitely recommend to anyone to eat here
sooooo good
great service
absolutely love this place -PRON- always have to get the crab cake and -PRON- boyfriend love the wagyu
-PRON- can not go wrong here
ever-
year ago this mcdonald 's location have a grease fire
to this day that horrible burn grease smell be still extremely prevalent when -PRON- walk in the door
the only way to rid this stench be to bulldoze and build another from scratch
-PRON- also have this player piano in this location which be often too loud and these be the reason -PRON- get -PRON- order to go
as far as food quality go well -PRON- be mcdonalds
which be not necessarily a bad thing
-PRON- do crave -PRON- burger now and
then and yes -PRON- be convenient
but -PRON- be hit and miss as far as freshness go
but -PRON- be really that awful smell inside that nauseate -PRON- to no end
amazing food
amazing atmosphere
great service
-PRON- server mia be fantastic
recommend a dish for -PRON- son and -PRON- be dead on
the crawfish combo dinner be delicious and spicy
the greek salad be make fresh at -PRON- tableside
the praline cheesecake be really good
-PRON- would definitely come back to this restaurant and would recommend this if -PRON- have never have cajun food

-PRON- review be go to be pretty biased because -PRON- come here when -PRON- shut down the whole park for just the company employee and -PRON- family
-PRON- may not be as big and have as many slide as other water park in the valley
but -PRON- always have a good time when come here
the slide that -PRON- do have be entertaining but to -PRON- the good part be -PRON- wave pool nothing beat a big wave rush towards -PRON-
so once again -PRON- personal car be charge rather than -PRON- business card
-PRON- request this stay that -PRON- be waive the requirement of put a personal card on file because of this issue that continue to happen
-PRON- have no sympathy
the night manager could have care less what happen to -PRON- bank account as long as -PRON- follow policy
the only reason why -PRON- put a second star on this be because -PRON- have the general manager come in the following morning -PRON- finally make -PRON- so that -PRON- and -PRON- fellow worker do not have to provide a second card on any of -PRON- future stay
something every other hotel -PRON- have stay at have do for -PRON- from day one
lucky for -PRON- -PRON- be move on and leave this hotel in the past for good hopefully
-PRON- be on the fence here
three star or four
-PRON- think -PRON- will give -PRON- four star and retract -PRON- if -PRON- go again and have a similar experience
-PRON- wife get a chalupa
-PRON- get two taco one chicken one chorizo
-PRON- also get a small order of load nacho
-PRON- taco be great
-PRON- taste pretty authentic and fresh
the tortilla shell be great this be where -PRON- want to rate -PRON- four star .then there be the nachos which be too loaded
-PRON- could have split the nachos and -PRON- would have be plenty of dinner
but -PRON- be pretty run of the mill nachos this be where -PRON- want to rate -PRON- three star
-PRON- will be try -PRON- again
-PRON- be lot of food for a really low cost
this little restaurant be hide away on bay surround by condo
-PRON- would never imagine there would be a good restaurant tuck away here
this place have open -PRON- eye to other area of toronto that can offer great food
this place perfect for a date night -PRON- high glass wall and intimate setting be the perfect place to take someone out on a date for drink
-PRON- have a wide selection of cocktail and of course an extensive wine list
-PRON- would recommend the italiano gardino a gin base cocktail with cucumber and crush black pepper
the staff be very kind and helpful if -PRON- ever need anything and be quick to rectify any issue that -PRON- have
a friend of mine have order a pasta dish and have find a hair in -PRON- food
-PRON- tell -PRON- waiter would quickly apologize and quickly get a new meal out for -PRON-
as an apology -PRON- offer -PRON- a dessert on the house
now with that be say -PRON- time to turn to the big negative the food and price
after eat here -PRON- would have to say the price for the food do not match up with the quality of the food
the value for money be the pizza
-PRON- have a good array of different pizza for standard price but -PRON- would not say the food be spectacular
-PRON- be satisfy but -PRON- have have good pizza in toronto
that pasta be the bad value for money
-PRON- friend have order the gnoochi to share with -PRON- date but when the meal come -PRON- be only four literally four because -PRON- count gnoochi for the whole dish
-PRON- mean for $ 17 that be terrible
there be no way the restaurant could justify the price even if -PRON- be just make and the potato be import for ireland
overall this be a great place to get a drink and go on a date 5\/5
for food on the other hand severely overprice and for the quality of food not worth the money
omg wow
so good
i just have 5 coffee here because -PRON- so good
-PRON- do not live near henderson so when -PRON- do and -PRON- be hungry -PRON- have to pick a worthy place
this time -PRON- hit the nail on the head with prosecco
this restaurant in a big strip mall be kind of unassum but be really good
-PRON- eat at an odd time 2:30pm
so -PRON- be the only people on -PRON- patio
service be very attentive although the server be not under any pressure
everything be attend to very quickly and course be serve back to back with no overlapping
the dish -PRON- eat caesar salad very good salad cold bowl and cold lettuce add to the wonderful crunch
the chunk of parmesan in the salad be great and plentiful
prosecco salad mango heirloom tomato avocado persian cucumber and a nice creamy balsamic
capellini pomodoro- really good angel hair with a light red sauce and basil
really good classic dish
the pasta be very fresh
cheese ravioli -the good dish of the day
gray raviolis in a light creamy cheese beschamel
every bite a gluttonous delight
truly a great pasta dish
overall -PRON- will be back again
even if -PRON- do not have to be on that side of town
first off let -PRON- say that -PRON- be here with a group of friend and -PRON- be have 5 star fun that night
so even if -PRON- be in a 7 11 -PRON- would rate -PRON- 4 star
that say temple bar be a nice open sport bar that seem to attract the beautiful people -PRON- normally do not see in establishment of this type in -PRON- neck of the wood
for as crowd as -PRON- be that night -PRON- think the server do a good job
the drink be cold and -PRON- get -PRON- relatively quickly
the icing on the cake for -PRON- be that -PRON- bring a band to party with -PRON- thank to ted for arrange this
-PRON- be a cool local band call safety orange check -PRON- out sometime if -PRON- get a chance
great fun
very delicious
-PRON- love -PRON-
service can be a bit faster but -PRON- be well worth -PRON-
-PRON- be very stingy with -PRON- mince pork rice lol
but again -PRON- be still good
overrated and likely live on -PRON- 's reputation
-PRON- wife and -PRON- be excited to dine at the legendary double eagle -PRON- would hear so much about the place
sadly that do not happen and likely will not
-PRON- arrive a little early for -PRON- reservation only to turn around within a few minute of look over the interior and leave for a compete steakhouse in a nearby casino
-PRON- be so underwhelmed the interior seem dingy somewhat noisy and not anywhere near as welcome and comfortable as -PRON- would expect a highly rat steakhouse to be
the bad part about this experience be that -PRON- begin before -PRON- open the door the valet do not say a word to -PRON- and as -PRON- approach the main door a strong sewage smell assault the sens
not what one want to smell when head in for a bite to eat
because -PRON- leave clearly -PRON- do not dine
so -PRON- can not say much about the food other than -PRON- have have the opportunity to dine a couple of time at a del frisco 's near -PRON- in southern california and food
there have be consistently excellent and the service quite good
hopefully the double eagle be just have a bad day but sadly -PRON- leave a last poor impression with -PRON- and -PRON- be likely -PRON- will not return
jimmy 's be the new coffee joint in kensington market and a definite sign of -PRON- gentrification
there be air conditioning for instance a first for a kensington coffee shop
because of -PRON- newness there be a lot of gloss
-PRON- wonder though about the institutional ability
the barista have a bad attitude and -PRON- can not identify the owner jimmy not a good sign for a new place
if the owner be bored the place go to hell
every time
another incongruous thing about the place be that -PRON- be position -PRON- as a high end cafe but when there be no hint of coffee nerd culture here
the barista do not want to discuss why -PRON- be upset
-PRON- ask for a ristretto
-PRON- seem -PRON- pull allongé here montreal style without really ask
again this be not a good sign
yes the muffin etc be great
but nothing be make in house
altogether there be a kind of starbucks feel about the place
high price disgruntled worker purchase baked good bottled juice
on the other hand -PRON- would much rather be here than at starbucks
the coffee be still good and the decor and music be good
perhaps the good thing about the place be the huge skylight create wonderful light inside for reading or working
so 3.5 star for now
let -PRON- hope there be not a genteel decline in the next year
be -PRON- be too harsh
jimmy where be -PRON-
-PRON- family and -PRON- go here for lunch today
-PRON- all choose the ayce option
-PRON- be $ 21 for lunch and include almost everything on the menu no sashimi
-PRON- husband eat 8 roll
the food be fresh and come out at a nice pace which give -PRON- more time to relax and talk with each other
-PRON- be not rush and there be no time limit like there be at ayce place
-PRON- do not eat fish or seaweed and be surprised that there be so many choice for -PRON- to do the ayce as well terriyaki chicken gyoza egg roll miso soup salad vegetarian roll with soy wrap and beef plate
-PRON- highly recommend the grilled beef asparagus thinly sliced beef wrap around an asparagus spear and grill with a light sweet sauce on top
each ayce lunch come with 1 dessert -PRON- have the chocolate creme brulee absolutely fantastic
service be good
vangie -PRON- waitress work at -PRON- pace
-PRON- give -PRON- time to look over the menu in full make some very tasty suggestion and be able to answer all -PRON- question about ingredient and what be include
any time -PRON- accidentally veer off the include choice vangie let -PRON- know and suggest a similar item from the include choice
-PRON- be very patient with -PRON- and really keep the food come out while give -PRON- -PRON- space
if -PRON- go ask for -PRON-
-PRON- read some review where the server just do not come back after awhile not vangie
as -PRON- see -PRON- plate empty -PRON- return to ask if -PRON- want more clear off used dish and refill beverage
oyshi be definately go onto -PRON- list of place to return often and soon
bad company ever
ahs use -PRON- as a contractor for hvac work
needless to say here
-PRON- be 48 hour later and the issue have not be resolve
-PRON- send out a tech today and -PRON- claim that -PRON- be nv energys fault and that the reason -PRON- furnace do not work be because of there faulty thermostat
-PRON- would not even change the thermostat to confirm -PRON- be a faulty thermostat
so -PRON- leave and -PRON- call nv energy -PRON- send a employee out hour later tonight and the nv energy employee replace the thermostat with the new one and go -PRON- be not the thermostat
-PRON- be -PRON- furnace
this be not the first time -PRON- have see home warranty contractor send out a company to fix something and -PRON- blame -PRON- on -PRON-
not to mention the technician -PRON- send out be extremely rude and rush through the whole job
-PRON- do not know how people like this be in business with the piss poor customer service -PRON- offer
thank for let -PRON- freeze to death -PRON- bunch of hack
just so everyone day 3 of no heat in -PRON- home due to there incompetent technician reuben come out and claim -PRON- fix the problem to -PRON- at 3 p.m. on 12\/3\/16 and now -PRON- be not work at midnight again
-PRON- have the guy cellohne and -PRON- call -PRON- and now -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- be the computer board in the furnace
do not -PRON- think a qualified technician in hvac would have figure this out the first time -PRON- come
please do not let this hack job scam company come into -PRON- home or -PRON- will suffer the same consequence
ama bad company in america may -PRON- building catch fire and burn in the flame of hell that -PRON- belong
this place be good for aa5 event in the summer and most monday because of good drink special but other than that -PRON- can not go high than a 3 because -PRON- seem like too much cramp in one small area and the crowd that frequent seem stick up and unfriendly
if -PRON- be a fan of hummus here be where -PRON- need to go
-PRON- be great
-PRON- go with -PRON- husband and kid and -PRON- be all pleased which be hard to do
-PRON- have the chicken lunch plate with rice and a salad

however -PRON- be a bit overpriced $ 6 for -PRON- cheesecake delight
parking could also be an issue in downtown champaign but -PRON- walk so -PRON- do not have to worry about that
-PRON- get a referral to this place
and -PRON- have to say a v radiator save -PRON- enough cash to go enjoy some local food
in -PRON- case a new radiator be $ 270 plus tax
a v replace the plastic tank and clean the inside of the radiator and then pressure test -PRON-
-PRON- bring -PRON- in and -PRON- be do quick
cash only but $ 70 later and the radiator look good as new
-PRON- can not complain great price and one of -PRON- coworker have use -PRON- twice for -PRON- car and -PRON- daughter
both car still have no problem via the radiator after 2 year
give -PRON- a call -PRON- can bring -PRON- radiator in or -PRON- can quote -PRON- repair and labor
plus lo los chicken and waffles be across the street or run over to city scape and grab a bite
by the time -PRON- do munching -PRON- should be do with -PRON- car

delicious
the guy behind the register be a nice guy too
be in search of another local business to give -PRON- monie to and see good review for jobot coffee in downtown phoenix and -PRON- experience poor customer service
from the time -PRON- post video of the coffee shop 's aesthetic to -PRON- hangry mood kick in -PRON- spend a whopping 45 minute wait on a breakfast sandwich
when -PRON- ask the cashier for a refund -PRON- do just that
no apology no ownership no customer service
take -PRON- dollar else where -PRON- friend
look like -PRON- will be back at -PRON- favorite coffee shop
-PRON- be pissed and hungry af
-PRON- second visit and -PRON- last
the first trip -PRON- go to select a tub shower surround and fixture for these 2 item for the vacation home -PRON- be build in wisconsin
the girl be helpful but could not find -PRON- contractor 's information although -PRON- use first supply exclusively
-PRON- ask -PRON- to write up a quote but -PRON- end up do -PRON- as an order so -PRON- contractor say -PRON- be charge full retail instead of -PRON- rate
-PRON- second visit be to pick out 3 faucet
after some time someone come to see if -PRON- have question
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- be pick out 3 faucet
and -PRON- say that -PRON- should have make an appointment for a whole house purchase 3 faucet and that no one have that kind of time today
so -PRON- look at faucet in the showroom pick out what -PRON- want -PRON- and will purchase -PRON- elsewhere like studio 41 where people be actually helpful
-PRON- must say -PRON- service associate steve bundy be first rate
the actual 2007 mercedes e550 would have have $ 17,000 in repair at a minimum in 5 year and 25,000 drive mile
-PRON- be show the car legitimately need another $ 5,787 in repair
so -PRON- dump the car at 62,000 mile for $ 5,000
when -PRON- call the regional mercedes benz -PRON- be tell -PRON- have work with the dealer to give -PRON- a 17 discount on the repair
-PRON- have no problem with the dealership rather the manufacturer
how about a new transmission at 39,000 mile
this be -PRON- second mercedes and never again
dang be a really fun tapas lounge bar and have amazing food
like with all tapa -PRON- can get costly real fast
the fry chicken wing the one shape as a ball and the sizzle beef be -PRON- absolute fav
the scallop and goi salad be also really yummy
-PRON- recommend -PRON- all
-PRON- go on a sat evening and -PRON- be totally empty
be be the only people in the whole resto
-PRON- wish there be more people there
not sure if -PRON- the area -PRON- be locate in or just be new
overall -PRON- love -PRON- experience there because the wait staff be very friendly
the food be delicious
the atmosphere be light and for all those reason 4 star


come here for a full set for a wedding and then a touch up about a week and a half prior to go on vacation
-PRON- be -PRON- first time for a full set
and -PRON- absolutely love -PRON-
gaby be awesome
currently a member and would not change -PRON-
already recommend a few of -PRON- friend
this place be a las vegas staple
-PRON- always come here for brunch when -PRON- be in town
the food and portion be out of this world
one meal here will fill -PRON- for an entire day and the price make -PRON- all worth -PRON-
much good deal and food than any buffet in town can offer
do not waste -PRON- time here
these be unprofessional people who do nothing other than misrepresent and lie to customer
have in attempt twice to make major purchase within the past year have do nothing more than waste -PRON- time
-PRON- run separate from sears and should be shut down along with the 500 mainline store that sears will be close
no one give a hoot about the customer
not the place to take the boy\/girl -PRON- wanna have some fun with at the end of the evening but great for see a movie alone or with friend
the staff be not the most attentive but the price be unbeatable
-PRON- can get out there spend 10 buck soda and popcorn include if -PRON- time -PRON- right and pick the perfect day during the week
if -PRON- have a free movie watchers card -PRON- get free popcorn on wednesday plus -PRON- get free stuff at other point as well
-PRON- also like -PRON- simply for the fact that -PRON- be not cinemark valley view
the people be not as annoying or maybe -PRON- be just because there be less of -PRON-
but at ridge park square -PRON- feel like -PRON- can enjoy -PRON- movie alittle better
-PRON- order the sashimi and -PRON- be the bad sushi -PRON- have ever have
the fish do not taste fresh and be serve in a bowl which -PRON- find rather strange
over all terrible
-PRON- will not be get sushi here again
hek yeah 's brisket be where -PRON- at
-PRON- be moist smokey super tender and have sensational flavor
especially when -PRON- get an end piece
all the seasoning and the smokiness collect at the end and -PRON- mouth be light up with a flavor explosion
-PRON- husband and -PRON- can not get enough of -PRON-
hek yeah barbecue be -PRON- go to place for outstanding brisket
thought -PRON- would give this place another try since -PRON- be be nearly a year since -PRON- last unfavorable pizza here
maybe -PRON- just -PRON- have bad luck since this place get so many rave review but once again the large sausage pizza that -PRON- be star at seem to be a bare crust totally devoid of any topping
-PRON- understand that this place pride -PRON- on -PRON- crust but c'mon add a few topping will not kill -PRON-
virtually no cheese tiny spot of sauce here and there and very sparse little crumble of sausage that must have be begrudgingly add
-PRON- be at least smart enough to take home about half of -PRON- since -PRON- remember -PRON- have some left over spinato 's at home
-PRON- take a slice of spinato 's and put -PRON- on top of the grimaldi 's crust pizza and when -PRON- re heated -PRON- -PRON- finally have pizza the way -PRON- suppose to be
spinato 's ample delicious topping on top of grimaldi 's coal fire platform be very tasty indeed
-PRON- have be go to this salon since -PRON- open
well the real reason be because -PRON- stylist from another salon move to this one
-PRON- be a cute trendy salon
all of the hair product -PRON- use and sell be bumble bumble which be a very popular brand
pretty good stuff too
and when -PRON- buy from there -PRON- earn point to get -PRON- discount
-PRON- have worker that shampoo -PRON- hair for the stylist which be pretty cool
-PRON- stylist 's name be marisol
-PRON- love her
-PRON- know exactly what cut style and color work best for -PRON- and -PRON- face shape
-PRON- have be go to -PRON- for many year
so -PRON- really trust that -PRON- will give -PRON- something that -PRON- will really like
-PRON- have never have a bad cut or color with -PRON-
-PRON- be highly recommend
-PRON- would have give this place 5 star
but -PRON- have to knock a star down for the price
-PRON- be still reasonable do not get -PRON- wrong
but -PRON- stylist do raise -PRON- price a bit compare to the other salon -PRON- be at
-PRON- be sure the rent at this place be the reason why
what a cool place
rich in history and -PRON- have try to preserve -PRON-
feel like -PRON- be step back in time
wall be cover with picture of famous people who have eat there
the food be serve on paper plate and with platicware which be not so great but -PRON- fit

the grit be sooooo gooood
-PRON- have never care for grit until now
-PRON- be so easy to park even though -PRON- be off street
someone even come out and hold a nearby parking space for -PRON- so nice
the inside be very spacious and -PRON- do feel like -PRON- be in an environment that -PRON- would find in new orleans
and the lighting be gorgeous
-PRON- server be so nice too
-PRON- come in around 3:30 and -PRON- tell -PRON- of the special start at 4
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- be interested in the special so -PRON- come back to or table at exactly 4 so -PRON- could get the deal

l'usine c porte bien son nom puisque cette salle principalement dédiée
au théâtre est située dan une ancienne usine
j'ai surtout fréquenté ce lieu de diffusion culturelle
à l'occasion du festival de théâtre
des amériques qui a lieu sur une base annuelle
aussi le café de l'usine
qui se présente comme un bistro ouvert le midi est également ouvert avant les représentation
personnellement j'y ai seulement bu une tasse de café qui était relativement bonne
aussi c' la configuration de la salle
qui est
ici intéressante
puisqu'elle permet aux troupe de loger des équipement expérimentaux que ce soit des cage oui
j'en ai déjà été témoin ou une multitude d'écran
bref l'usine c est une page blanche sur laquelle
le nouveau théâtre peut s'écrire comme il l'entend
contemporary yet cozy feel and menu serve as tapa to share
portion be healthy but the flavor and texture combination really be the standout feature if this place
-PRON- have the gnudi beet octopus broccoli spätzle and cheesecake

everything about dc ranch be clean cute and comfortable
from the house to the market street everything be top notch
over the year dc ranch have take a little turn
what start as the all in one community equip with nightlife day life and living essential have transform into more of a community without so much of the nightlife and -PRON- think that be a good thing
-PRON- will begin with market street
this be the area that have transform over the year and with -PRON- the nightlife style bar have vanish
-PRON- think this have allow dc ranch to turn into more of a homey community rather than the next old town
several restaurant still line the street and very popular one at that
on of -PRON- favorite wine bar be still there and there be several boutique retail store
-PRON- be a nice shopping area to walk around on a weekend
now move on to dc ranch the community
the house in dc ranch be like little castle
the architecture be pretty and the house be private and in a community at the same time
within the community resident have a club equip with a pool playground tennis court and community area
this be perfect for family and make -PRON- a community with real neighbor
each section be behind gate as well
-PRON- think that dc ranch be a great option for a family with small child who want to live in a safe and enclose area
if -PRON- wana deal with attitude an pushy sale man go right on ahead
-PRON- will tell -PRON- one thing when -PRON- do paper work
but 1 month into -PRON- will change the payment an say there be a issue with out a head up these people be very shady there more worried about the down payment then actually look at the credit an seeing if -PRON- qualify with out a down payment
-PRON- be pushy a about the down payment

yum
-PRON- also have apfelstrudel for dessert
there be live entertainment and -PRON- be lucky enough to be there at the same time as a bachelor party which make the atmosphere at 2:00 in the afternoon very boisterous
-PRON- totally enjoy -PRON- and love find a place off the strip that be so fun and have good food too
a great little sushi place good sized portion and fair price
have be several time and the good be always fresh and service pleasant and fast
-PRON- get busy at lunch so get there early to get a seat
also one nice thing be that -PRON- do not have any tv blare away in the background and -PRON- be generally a quiet place to talk or catch up on the news
within walk distance of -PRON- hotel and recommend by the staff
there be great lunch deal there plus air conditioning to get out of the tempe heat
$ 7 for soup pad thai salad and thai iced tea
-PRON- be less than $ 10 for tax plus tip
not bad
-PRON- have to agree with the other yelpers about the crappy service
-PRON- have such yummy food that -PRON- want to rate higher but -PRON- can not do -PRON-
-PRON- just love come here
-PRON- be so happy to have this place in -PRON- neighborhood
-PRON- love the relaxed atmosphere the incredible food and most of the server -PRON- have have have be great -PRON- especially love victoria
the only thing -PRON- have an issue with be the spice level be not always the same
most of the time -PRON- like a 2
once -PRON- be so flip hot so next time
-PRON- get a 1
that one be so bland
so -PRON- get a side of 2 and that be not hot enough and -PRON- kind of ruin -PRON- shrimp
last time -PRON- get the two and -PRON- be perfect
-PRON- charge for the little side not much
but -PRON- would prefer -PRON- to just be more consistent
-PRON- sure have not stop -PRON- from come back
-PRON- eat here way more than -PRON- probably should
be here about three time
the decor be nice and simple
the first time -PRON- really like -PRON- but the second and third time be a completely different scene whole bunch of hipster and a lot of -PRON- guy friend complain about the girl selection lmao drinks be a little pricy than normal but nothing compare to a club
the rooftop be nice if -PRON- do not take 30 minute stand in line to get up there but -PRON- selection of music become very random and -PRON- have basically stop go here
easily the good gluten free bakery in town
jackie be insanely sweet and the cake be amazing
-PRON- highly recommend ur sweet madness and -PRON- will be back often for every occasion
buffalo wild wings typically have horrible service so -PRON- be not expect much
-PRON- waiter\/server be very friendly
-PRON- drink be never empty
food come out fast
-PRON- have never be grace with that luxury at other buffalo wild wings location
-PRON- order be mess up once but -PRON- be fix immediately
there be also double the amount of tv 's on the wall than any location -PRON- have be to so -PRON- do not have to ask to be seat in a certain spot or constantly turn around to see the different game
also have more seating than the other location
if -PRON- be head to buffalo wild wings to catch a game pick this one
personally -PRON- think this be one of the close authentic greek restaurant on the danforth
-PRON- have -PRON- typical greek dish from the grill and then there be the premade hot plate dish
-PRON- will find oven baked lima bean lamb fricase artichoke augolemono egg lemon and thing like tripe soup and mom 's greek meatball soup
-PRON- have try each
and -PRON- be not disappoint at all
-PRON- be as if -PRON- mom make -PRON-
the place be a little divey inside but really -PRON- only come here for the food and not so much the experience
-PRON- would recommend definitely so
a close comparison equally good be filo at pape and o'connor
what a great place to have up in the neighborhood
and if -PRON- can get there in time for happy hour -PRON- be set
fantastic price for happy hour and even not on happy hour price be very reasonable
the menu be very big so get hard to decide what -PRON- want to eat but everything -PRON- have try have be good
very large inside and be always busy on friday night so must be do something right
spiga cucina be a great option for italian food locate in north scottsdale
-PRON- can get busy so reservation be a must
-PRON- get a table near the kitchen so -PRON- be kinda loud but -PRON- make the most of -PRON-
-PRON- be greet by -PRON- server with water as soon as -PRON- sit down
after review the wine list which offer a great selection of italian wine -PRON- have narrow -PRON- selection down to a few so -PRON- ask the man stand nearby who clearly not a server -PRON- thought
-PRON- turn out fernando be the owner
-PRON- steer -PRON- to one of the wine a vietti nebbiolo which be outstanding
-PRON- server tell -PRON- about the special include a grouper and also an osso buco which both sound great but -PRON- need to be hungry to tackle a buco by -PRON-
-PRON- end up go with the tortiglioni portobello dish and the veal saltimbocca
-PRON- veal be great and -PRON- would order that again
the veal be wrap with prosciutto with a sage seasoning
the fresh veggie add to the dish
there be no room for desert but -PRON- leave very satisfied
ask for steve
-PRON- know what be up
super nice guy and really easy to talk to
-PRON- always take the time to give -PRON- any information -PRON- be look for and then some
this deli be so small
-PRON- family and -PRON- sit on a table of six and -PRON- still have three more space
the waiter merge -PRON- with these two guy and -PRON- parent be very icky about -PRON- personal bubble
but -PRON- be very social and nice with -PRON- and -PRON- feel like -PRON- be all typical friend just eat at a resto
after that -PRON- be very noticeable that -PRON- parent have a very good time and -PRON- never get bother by tight space with stranger anymore
memorable experience
-PRON- have be stop here every year for the last 3 4 year on -PRON- way to spooner wi
this place have something for everything but know -PRON- price
some piece be very reasonable and other price be high
otherwise -PRON- have some cool piece
sometimes a special occasion just call for a giant hunk of meat
in fact -PRON- will call for a giant hunk of meat right now
meat
meat
mmmmmmmmmmmeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaatttttttt
that be what dining at morton 's be like
an unabashed opportunity to set loose -PRON- inner carnivore in hope of decimate some hapless steer that wander too close to the stun gun
portion be huge
rational people would share the rib or fillet one per table
-PRON- see the place as a challenge to -PRON- very manhood a bloody gauntlet throw to the floor then pick up and use to wipe away the meat sweat to follow
beware
the wait staff be bad enabler than family member who crash the pasadena recovery centre on celebrity rehab
-PRON- ply -PRON- with expensive liquor and set before -PRON- a whole onion bread and slab of butter
-PRON- attack the bread with a viciously serrate wood handle knife and slather -PRON- with animal fat i.e. butter
-PRON- wolf -PRON- down before the waiter now smirk come back to take -PRON- order
-PRON- barely look up from the oniony poppy seeds crumb wipe the butter from -PRON- jowl and command the onion soup the platter of hot seafood or if -PRON- want to be laugh at a salad
the onion soup be a flame cauldron of cheese set atop a thick crouton
-PRON- be pleasant but oddly light one suspect -PRON- be make with chicken stock which be odd consider the sheer number of beef carcass that must roll through the place
the onion be also slightly underdone
the cheese be well blister but the whole thing feel half baked
the hot seafood platter be better execute but share between two people -PRON- only serve to whet the appetite
oyster rockefeller be the highlight mainly because of the cream spinach involve
-PRON- love -PRON- some cream spinach
enough of this silliness -PRON- want to say
bring me meat
and -PRON- do massive cut of cornf us prime which blow -PRON- pale alberta cousin out of the pasture
this be manly beef
the kind of beef that be -PRON- to encounter -PRON- on a beach clothe in -PRON- fashionable speedo with a large uddered cow on -PRON- be arm would kick sand in -PRON- face with -PRON- dainty hoof
-PRON- be a beefgasm
side would be a waste of belly space if -PRON- be not so good
giant tempura onion ring be a meal in -PRON-
cottage fry potato lie somewhere between mythic hashbrown and rosti 's butch cousin from the wrong side of the track
fat and juicy asparagus benefit from an application of hollandaise because god know -PRON- need more fat in this meal
cream spinach deserve -PRON- be own restaurant -PRON- be that damn good
vibrant green freshly chop and laden with garlic
-PRON- praise -PRON-
if -PRON- have room for dessert or coffee no if -PRON- can finish -PRON- plate -PRON- must have a tapeworm

no doubt a great hotel
lively pristine high end on most thing
and then something for everyone
cool theme and everyone be there to have fun
sometimes -PRON- do not see how -PRON- nightly rate can be 30 or 40%higher than other but -PRON- must be occupancy rate
this be the only thing keep -PRON- from 5 star
restaurant be amazing and -PRON- have a plethora of place to choose from
gym and spa be awesome too
distribution as with any of the big resort -PRON- have to learn and get use to what be where or take off with plenty of time to wander around

-PRON- have an amazing stay and fun time here
and when the rate be good -PRON- will stay many times
-PRON- be not often -PRON- can give a fast food establishment 5 star and -PRON- be not give this location 5 star base on one experience

this be the good italian restaurant -PRON- have ever eat at

this be not a sushi bar -PRON- be a loud dark bar that have sushi

no physical sushi bar
-PRON- get a feeling
-PRON- be a bunch of north carolina pathetic poser try to pretend -PRON- be in a hip new york bar
sooo lame
end up go to sushi 101 great sushi there
-PRON- be no yogi but -PRON- know a good instructor when -PRON- meet one
ok maybe not
but -PRON- know what -PRON- like

even puma -PRON- know -PRON- name and chat with -PRON- when -PRON- come to a class
-PRON- be a huge fan of puma 's beginner class and think that the beginner 's workshop would probably be amazing for those just start out
-PRON- love love love susan 's class too
-PRON- be a riot and always manage to challenge -PRON-
while most of the instructor here focus on vinyasa style there be vary degree among -PRON-
a great non pretentious studio for yogis of all level
must try the around the world sampler
-PRON- be a fun way to escape the heat and goof off
one drink be particularly disgusting and -PRON- will have a lot of fun watch facial expression as people sip -PRON-
find a table can be pretty hard when -PRON- be pack so definitely have someone from -PRON- party hunt for one while -PRON- order
-PRON- food be super delicious
-PRON- live around in the neighborhood can not get over this hidden gem
-PRON- have a very broad menu with lot of selection all the food have be delicious
-PRON- crack corn be so good
very enjoyable
get to say probably the most creative dish that -PRON- will find in charlotte and a presentation to match
-PRON- be a bit hesitant at first to even try this place as -PRON- just imagine in -PRON- head nothing but ultra small gourmet plate
-PRON- be way off base -PRON- order a lamb tenderloin dish and be very pleased with portion size and the taste be phenomenal
-PRON- be here with -PRON- love and -PRON- be indeed a romantic setting
service be top notch too and -PRON- will do whatev to make sure -PRON- be take care of from the moment -PRON- walk in till -PRON- be ready to leave
the only drawback -PRON- have be the decor
low ceiling cheap table and chair and the location of the seating be too close to other diner
that be a real bummer for -PRON- but overall -PRON- would certainly go back
-PRON- have avoid safeway for over a year now because -PRON- abolish the self checkout station
tonight
-PRON- go in to buy just one item and have to wait in line behind many people with full cart
if -PRON- still have the self checkout
line -PRON- would have be do fast
now -PRON- always go to frys or walmart

but -PRON- don;t care how old be
-PRON- be something can happen to any one at any age
-PRON- call blossom and no way to announce the person to go to -PRON- car or no way to get a hold of -PRON-
-PRON- think this pl;ace should have good way of do important thing
-PRON- have never be there and never will
simply the good ice cream -PRON- have ever taste
the fruit flavor be unbelievable
-PRON- may find a place to own next door just so -PRON- can walk over any time perhaps -PRON- should say all the time on 2nd think maybe -PRON- should move to the other side of the world
this addiction could get bad than crack
great service amazing view and excellent food
if -PRON- be ever in lake las vegas -PRON- would recommend come here
-PRON- have be come here for year and -PRON- never disappoint

would never stay here again have the bad customer service at any hotel -PRON- have ever stay at

the venetian concierge front desk and elite service be unable to cancel reservation or refund money even though -PRON- be book at -PRON- hotel
-PRON- say -PRON- be not -PRON- responsibility because -PRON- be through a second party vendor that -PRON- endorse
the company the wild west horseback would also not refund money even though -PRON- ticket agency say -PRON- would
the venetian offer the bad customer service at any hotel -PRON- have ever stay in
-PRON- would never stay again and would advise anyone else to look at other hotel that care more about -PRON- guest than make a few dollar on a second party reservation
great ambiance and service but -PRON- could not appreciate the drink that much
-PRON- guess -PRON- have really high expectation
every time -PRON- have go -PRON- have have live music which be usually really good
-PRON- food be great for bar food
while -PRON- be a small bar -PRON- be connect to a wine bar next door
so -PRON- can get great wine from there
great coffee and have to try those timbit
very clean and comfortable

-PRON- husband be love the rib
quality ingredient perfectly prepared
the place have a really good feel to -PRON- and the owner and staff be great
food staff and vibe be 5 star
the only downfall
-PRON- be small so there be a bit of a wait sometimes
and -PRON- do not take reservation
small restaurant along college street just across from kensington market
try the single vegetarian platter $ 15 which be well proportion but -PRON- do not like how the brown lentil be whole
-PRON- prefer mushy ethiopian food
otherwise still pretty solid with good injera
like most typical ethiopian restaurant service be slow and mellow
be patient
beware there be no ac here
order on postmates get a text about ten minute later say -PRON- order be cancel because the merchant be too busy to take order
lol awesome way of say do not come back again basically
post mate also have a process debit on -PRON- card for six day until -PRON- fall off as well
in the future -PRON- will consider another place to eat
ease of ordering and the delivery be great
the food have one flavor and that be sweet kung pao be sweet general tso be sweet garlic chicken be sweet
no spice at all
not a lot of flavor
vegetable be super crunchy and fresh though
of all the deliciousness here -PRON- find the service to be the most outstanding
-PRON- server ceala or chella
-PRON- be not certain be wonderful
and -PRON- have a confrontational customer -PRON- handle perfectly
-PRON- wish -PRON- live in the portland area because -PRON- would steal -PRON- to work at -PRON- business
-PRON- understand what good customer service be even when confront with a surgeon with a clear god complex
the lappert 's ice cream be outstanding as well
poor customer service can ruin even the good ice cream so -PRON- get 5 star all day from -PRON-
the wife and -PRON- stay here for 4 night because of a conference -PRON- attend at the hotel
the staff be very professional and courteous
when -PRON- arrive really early in the morning -PRON- ask if there be a lactation room or area where -PRON- wife could pump
to -PRON- amazement -PRON- let -PRON- check into -PRON- room at 10:00 am
one extra star for that alone
as -PRON- settle in and explore -PRON- realize that there be really nothing notable about the property
after visit other hotel -PRON- could not help but feel like -PRON- should have stay somewhere else because of the sheer magnitude of the architecture and decor of the other place
the elevator although a little dilapidated be super fast which be a delight after a tiring day of sightseeing where -PRON- just want to plop down on the bed
the bed
-PRON- be amazingly comfortable
-PRON- have a great sleep every night
the location be perfect
right smack in the middle of the strip close to everything
moishe 's oh moishe'
i'm so conflict about this steakhouse

be the service good
-PRON- be also ok but some of the staff have a big attitude problem on -PRON-
be the price ok

for the food and service -PRON- get -PRON- should not have to spend what -PRON- do on this place
-PRON- do not know guy
there be lot of other excellent steakhouse in the city at this price point
not sure what be so special here be 3 time by the way so this review be not base on a one time visit
all in all moishe 's be a ok
nothing great and nothing bad just average
ok so -PRON- do not realize there the green door be list as both the green door and green door
so -PRON- think -PRON- would repeat -PRON- under this listing
-PRON- be willing to forgive this place be in a rundown strip mall because -PRON- girlfriend and -PRON- have be excite about check out -PRON- first last
swinger club
at 3:00 am in las vegas on a sat night this place should be off the proverbial hook
-PRON- have vision of debauchery of the high magnitude as -PRON- be plan this evening
-PRON- hop to be able to boil holy water with -PRON- finger as -PRON- friend tom put -PRON- no such luck
there be maybe 20 people in there include the impressively creepy fast walking loud cartoonishly evil laughing be pony tail employee that be gather use towel -PRON- should get a raise btw while look much like a 12 year old boy who just run into the girl locker room after school
whoa
now -PRON- have a high tolerance for most thing of the naughty persuasion
-PRON- walk into this place with no qualm but 7 min into -PRON- visit a and
-PRON- turn to one another and mutter a mutual hell no
there be one very unattractive couple abuse a vibrator that -PRON- swear be scream help -PRON-
help -PRON- in a little nook in a little hall while a less attractive couple gawk watch be fine gawk be awkward and in a another room a pair be go through the fully clothe motion with all the enthusiasm one may muster while buy new tube sock
other than that be be almost all creepy even for a seedy place
guy wait for a good looking woman to wander in
much to -PRON- dismay that girl be -PRON- wonderful girlfriend a
much to -PRON- dismay neither of -PRON- be have any of -PRON-
the green door have all the charm of a rundown roller rink from the 70 's and all the sexual energy of the history channel 's civil war week
this piece of advice be come from a guy who have just be lucky enough to watch a gorgeous stripper maul -PRON- alarmingly beautiful girlfriend and vice verse for an hour before -PRON- go -PRON- be both ready for a wild evening
so here be the tip
do not go to the green door
-PRON- be a lot more likely to have a wild night by wave a $ 20 in the air at -PRON- local denny 's
one plus the guy work the door seem really nice even when -PRON- leave 8 min
after arrival
even when in a slip that would have make freud proud -PRON- answer -PRON- leave already
query with
yes
this place be lame
-PRON- would have be within -PRON- right to call -PRON- a jerk but be far too professional too do so
this place and the place next door from all appearance where a huge disappointment
whatev -PRON- be -PRON- be look for -PRON- will be happy if -PRON- look elsewhere
discover this place while at school
great food here and great price

-PRON- cancel -PRON- appointment
-PRON- would not recommend this spa
neon garage be cool
shuttle around the track be unorganized and slow
food and beer be on par with any big time sport venue
there be a lot of place to get food and beverage
plenty of bathroom
racing- be kind of boring not a lot of pass
typical of the current 1.5 mile nascar track 's
will not go back
amazing
-PRON- be worth the 2 hour long wait
-PRON- only have a limit amount of seat but -PRON- also add to the experience that -PRON- can sit so close to the magic
the pan roast be definitely the way to go
-PRON- have hear people from out of the state talk about this specific location and how -PRON- be amazing and so delicious
even if -PRON- google panroast las vegas -PRON- will get so many hit on people try to copy the recipe
how do -PRON- know this
-PRON- try
not the same
-PRON- can get pretty pricy but -PRON- give -PRON- a hefty amount of food and -PRON- do not skimp out on the seafood
come here with -PRON- entire family for -PRON- 50th

this great park for cub fan in particular and baseball fan in general
the amenity be fresh and well appoint
-PRON- do not have much charm
but -PRON- do pay tribute to wrigley and chicago
be -PRON- be able
the crowd be in full force who want to be in chicago when -PRON- can enjoy -PRON- team soak in some son and toss back a few beer
the seat be fairly affordable and the stadium be though out and the site line be excellent
restroom and concession be plentiful
be from california
-PRON- be surprised at the lack of thought or creativity in the beer and food be serve
-PRON- take two lap around the park before -PRON- find a decent beer
the food be mostly standard ballpark
there be a food truck zone in centerfield but alas nothing worth the line
the concession store be fairly well stock and command too dollar
-PRON- do much good shopping outside of the park
then again the selection be good at the park
parking be charge and chaotic
-PRON- be not uber friendly unless -PRON- walk a few block from the stadium
that be the route -PRON- go and -PRON- work out just fine
-PRON- walk over to the local target to grab some snack and drink
the bummer be the store do not sell alcohol because of some native american property law
in any case -PRON- be a very easy uber in but a bit of a pain on the way out
staff across the board be helpful and smile be abundant
so now the cubby be in the series
could this be the year
if -PRON- make -PRON- out to spring training this be a stadium worthy of a visit
make all the good as -PRON- giants be play
-PRON- be with a heavy heart that -PRON- say -PRON- last couple visit here via take out have not go well in term of food quality
-PRON- order general tso 's chicken with hot and sour soup and pick -PRON- up and drive home as -PRON- normally do
when -PRON- start to eat the soup -PRON- be warm but not hot
the soup be really bad
-PRON- have a thick consistency to -PRON- almost like -PRON- have be sit for a little too long and -PRON- taste so bad that -PRON- throw -PRON- out after one or two sip
the general tso 's chicken be acceptable but there seem to be some issue in consistency with this food item -PRON- make -PRON- slightly different every single time and the sauce be very watery this time around which be not that great
the fry rice taste a little stale as well
-PRON- be not a very enjoyable experience this last time around
-PRON- have notice the following since -PRON- first visit- the ground be sticky do not seem like that much cleaning go on here\/not really in depth cleaning strange smell inside of restuarant the front door could probably use a door professional to make -PRON- so -PRON- be even and open easy this be a minimal complaint\/professionalism complaint quality of food have steadily go down
-PRON- love big lot
-PRON- have some great deal on food
-PRON- have a toddler and -PRON- get fruit pouch for a fraction of the cost here
most of the product be not the good quality so -PRON- have to be a bit picky
there be some great deal if -PRON- can find -PRON- though
-PRON- have be go to pro nails since -PRON- move to glendale over 2 year ago
the owner and the staff be always professional and friendly
-PRON- entire family have -PRON- nail and pedicure do there
-PRON- also have -PRON- do -PRON- eyebrow waxing which be affordable
-PRON- be efficient and be very creative on -PRON- design
-PRON- also have a loyalty stamp card that givse -PRON- a $ 20 gift card after so many visit
decent food
awful service
-PRON- have approximately six employee work only four order inside and a couple in the drive through
-PRON- take -PRON- 20 minute to get -PRON- food and -PRON- get -PRON- order wrong multiple time even though -PRON- be enter correctly by the cashier
once -PRON- finally receive -PRON- correct order the food be generally good except for the wake up wrap which consist of an open face tortilla with cheese and bacon -PRON- could not even wrap the wrap
-PRON- be not an adventurous coffee or tea drinker
-PRON- like -PRON- strong and black
do not alter or dilute the flavor of a good coffee or tea with additive
starbucks do not have the good coffee
-PRON- tend to always have that over roast almost burn flavor to -PRON- blend
what -PRON- do like about this location be the seating
time to recuperate be a necessity after a rough brunch
a chill in the air during mini golf help the process but a hot drink with a punch be need to sober -PRON- all up
-PRON- spend almost three hour camp out at a table discuss various matter and never feel like -PRON- need to get up
when a coffee shop can accommodate camper -PRON- be a plus
dr. d and -PRON- staff have save -PRON- life
-PRON- could barely walk when -PRON- first start and now -PRON- be walk 3 mile a day do yoga and generally feel awesome
-PRON- be utilize the medical staff for all -PRON- wellness need and have have some great result

-PRON- be cool
very humble and genuinely appreciate -PRON- come in and tell -PRON- how much -PRON- love -PRON- food
this be what local business be all about
the staff and owner be all very friendly
and -PRON- know what -PRON- be do
the tour be a bit on the short side but -PRON- be right in the heart of where -PRON- be happen
then -PRON- get on to the sampling
-PRON- product be world class
no kidding
-PRON- be rack up some impressive award and like some of the other review say -PRON- think -PRON- may have convince -PRON- that -PRON- have just never have good gin until now
-PRON- husband be a bourbon connoisseur and absolutely love -PRON- copper city bourbon
-PRON- whiskey not highlight -PRON- creativity but also -PRON- willingness to partner with other business to bring out the good in the product
and -PRON- sound like -PRON- have plan to continue expand -PRON- product line
anyone look for a good bourbon or gin give -PRON- a try and support a local business
-PRON- bring -PRON- two son here because -PRON- want to use -PRON- scooter on the indoor skate park
-PRON- be free skate but -PRON- also offer skating and scooter lesson as well
-PRON- be impressed by the other activity -PRON- offer
-PRON- have a large climbing wall and many trampoline
-PRON- can pay for $ 22 for unlimited hour
-PRON- also offer more adult activity such as fitness class
-PRON- have free wifi
-PRON- have a small cafe that have pizza sandwich -PRON- have the premise turkey sandwich and the bread be dry
-PRON- guess -PRON- can not expect gourmet at a place like this
-PRON- have protein shake large pretzel fry and other finger food
no outside food or drink allow so a day here can set -PRON- back some money
the decor be pleasing consider -PRON- be a huge warehouse type place
-PRON- be set -PRON- up to look like an outdoor skate park
-PRON- have several large artificial tree wrap at the bottom with small white light
-PRON- brighten up the place and make -PRON- more appealing to adult in -PRON- opinion
-PRON- have several place that offer seat so -PRON- can watch the kid skate and jump
-PRON- definitely will come back here again
-PRON- be the sort of thing that -PRON- plan on spend at least a couple hour here consider what to pay
-PRON- do offer monthly memberships as well


on a side note the day -PRON- be here -PRON- tell -PRON- son that -PRON- need to get off the skate park because after 7 -PRON- only allow skateboard
-PRON- be
not sure if this be an everyday thing but if -PRON- plan on go -PRON- may want to call ahead to see what be allow or not at certain time or date
this place be amazing
for 10 buck -PRON- get a plateful of egg bacon toast and coffee to boot
the owner be super friendly and considerate
this be the most substantial brunch -PRON- have have in toronto and for a reasonable price
upscale and classy establishment
food here be too good to be true common for chef mark mcewan 's creation but just a tab bit expensive
-PRON- come here for summerlicious and also once for -PRON- birthday so -PRON- have try both menu
-PRON- be rare to find that the -iicious menu be just as good as the regular one
there seem to be a huge number of hip and hipster mexican restaurant pop up all over the city
and -PRON- be willing to try -PRON- all
unfortunately barrio coreano do not make the cut on -PRON- list of recommendation
-PRON- be not mexican nor do -PRON- claim to be an expert on mexican food
but in an effort to forge -PRON- credibility -PRON- live in new york where -PRON- have some of the good twist and take on mexican food plus -PRON- love good food
from have read a few other review on barrio -PRON- would seem that -PRON- have some very similar experience
-PRON- try to make reservation at playa cabana but -PRON- be all book
accord to some review barrio coreano seem to be the fall out choice venue
if all else fail go to barrio coreano
-PRON- start with the grill calamari
-PRON- be great
-PRON- could taste the mexican korean fusion happen in this dish
before -PRON- even make -PRON- through -PRON- first bite -PRON- next dish come
baja fish taco
the flavor be ok and spice mix well
the batter be a little heavy than other place -PRON- have try of the same dish
suddenly -PRON- carnita taco arrive and -PRON- barely get through -PRON- first two dish
carnita taco be basically pull pork
-PRON- do not love this one
-PRON- be too dry and quite bland
within 30 second -PRON- next order of taco arrive
the chicken tinga
wait
be this the pull pork or the chicken
-PRON- could not quite tell -PRON- apart
-PRON- be recommend that -PRON- have this dish serve in a hard shell
little do -PRON- know -PRON- be deep fry and that by the time -PRON- get around to eat -PRON- that hard shell taco fall apart
-PRON- be soggy and the flavor be as bland as the pull pork
radish garnish every single taco
-PRON- get that radish especially pickle be a staple ingredient in korean dish but -PRON- do not get the reasoning behind place -PRON- on every variety of taco
be -PRON- to hide the lack of flavor in each of these taco
-PRON- friend and -PRON- be also sucker for churro
so -PRON- had to try -PRON- despite how incredibly stuff -PRON- be
there be always room for churro or so -PRON- think
unfortunately -PRON- do not come close to what churro should taste like
-PRON- be a little too soft very heavy and extremely greasy
the caramel sauce be runny and well so water down that -PRON- could barely taste the salty sweet flavor of the caramel
-PRON- be not the bang or the piece de resistance that -PRON- be hop to leave with
maybe -PRON- order the wrong taco
or maybe -PRON- just go to the wrong playa chain
but -PRON- leave feeling overwhelmed by the price and underwhelm by the food
have say all of this -PRON- will always leave on a positive note and say that -PRON- like the spaghetti western decor and the vibe
the staff be also very friendly and attentive
-PRON- server be very knowledgeable and go out of -PRON- way to make -PRON- feel comfortable in -PRON- feeling of dismay
-PRON- service be very quick especially for -PRON- be lunch time
the first employee that start -PRON- sandwich be not the happy or most polite individual
-PRON- seem very much in a hurry even though there be nobody else in like behind -PRON-
the gentleman that -PRON- be have lunch with do not know what -PRON- want yet so -PRON- ask for a second to look and -PRON- response be well do -PRON- at least know what bread -PRON- would like maybe that would help -PRON- be more decisive
that be pretty rude for -PRON- taste
then lady that finish -PRON- sandwich be very polite joke with -PRON- and even compliment -PRON- tattoo
overall -PRON- be an average experience that -PRON- would expect from subway but could definitely be good
if the initial employee would have have a good attitude or seem interested in assist -PRON- -PRON- would have be a good experience
often time people that work in customer service and hospitality forget the customer service part
-PRON- be rather unfortunate
delicious ice cream
-PRON- have be here plenty of time esp when -PRON- be locate in that formerly defunct gas station
the ice cream be delicious and unique animal cookie flavor be -PRON- favorite as of late
the 2 scoop cone be a very generous serving
this come from a person who love sweet and sugar
perhaps because -PRON- usually stop here after a meal
find that -PRON- be more effective for -PRON- and -PRON- boo to share a 2 scoop and put a cup on -PRON- rather than -PRON- get 2 cone
this only work if one person so graciously do not mind no cone
-PRON- can also buy package ice cream and take -PRON- home
from midwest where the line for this chain be hour since there be only 4 or 5 2 in -PRON- area
well -PRON- enjoy no wait and the food be great

go last night to the new gay bar in town that be not by any other gay bar
and -PRON- be pretty spectacular
-PRON- be in an odd location right by blueberry hill restaurant but that may be work for -PRON- because -PRON- do not have a reputation base on -PRON- be neighbor like fruit loop commercial center and the mid part of town that include flex escape lounge and the sort
-PRON- be hard to describe the clientele which be a good thing but -PRON- be not a daddy bar drag bar although a queen do pop in for a bit twink bar or even a sleazy look hook up bar and there be no go gos
if -PRON- be in the scene -PRON- have see all these type
the guy and girl mid 20's-40 's be more of the professional set
the bar be clean with a lot of flat screen tv pool table dart board and big red booth face the bar
-PRON- be almost as if a straight bar go gay overnight
-PRON- seem that everyone smoke at this bar -PRON- mean more so than usual
-PRON- minus a star b\/c -PRON- do not accept credit card and there be no sign say -PRON- but there be an atm by the door
the drink be cheap and there be plenty of parking

as for -PRON- sale department justin a great dude spend the good part of an hour educate -PRON- after -PRON- have close
-PRON- can not recommend -PRON- enough

-PRON- go here on a tuesday night after work for a quick dinner with -PRON- husband
-PRON- get a medium bbq chicken pizza amazing
the gal take -PRON- order be pleasant
the two star be give because of the poor state of the salad bar
-PRON- be not sure if this place just do not get a rush hour -PRON- be completely empty the entire time -PRON- be there
but the salad bar be so poorly stock quite disheveled the ice berg lettuce look three day old be wilt and be not chop to a reasonable size more like pull apart carelessly
the tomato be old and mushy some start to rot several container or condiment be basically empty
-PRON- know this be not a salad place -PRON- be a pizza joint
but every other barros -PRON- have be too have always take care of -PRON- salad bar
when this salad bar be right by the register there really be not an excuse to not tend to -PRON- or keep clean and stock
since -PRON- be a huge fan and -PRON- work in the area -PRON- will try to come back during lunch to see if there be any improvement to the salad bar

update

truly
-PRON- love -PRON- pad thai but -PRON- usually go with the avocado chicken

the caliber of skater be much good than last year and the acrobat be just superb
-PRON- think the show be about 30min and every seat be pretty much a good seat
this year joannie rochette be the headliner

in prior year the headliner would come out several time
-PRON- also fall
kenya acrobats

-PRON- have some funny other item too like deep fry peanut butter and jam
regardless -PRON- still like the cne
-PRON- have some window tint add to the front 2 window on -PRON- vehicle and the inside detailed
the tint be do perfectly an awesome job
the detail make -PRON- car like new again
well worth the $ 99
-PRON- detail a lot of the new car for the car dealer near by
so -PRON- know -PRON- do a decent job before -PRON- even come in
horrible customer service and very rude front desk lady
-PRON- will never go again
poor ambience and operation
fresh which seem to be copy aux vivre 's schtick or be -PRON- the other way around be a vegetarian\/vegan restaurant
everyone there have asymmetrical hair cut
the service be good but -PRON- waitress look like someone run over -PRON- dog
-PRON- have a ginger\/lemon\/orange smoothie which -PRON- hop would cure -PRON- budding sore throat
and -PRON- sort of do
-PRON- also have a burrito which be tasteless and boring
-PRON- do enjoy -PRON- vegan coleslaw very impressive
overall the restaurant which be a chain offer sub par but healthy option to people look for a quick meal
the atmosphere and decor be simplistic and quiet but -PRON- be not the kind -PRON- place -PRON- stick around and order another round of drink for
strictly eat and glare at other hipster type o place
-PRON- have be here three time now and have have mixed feeling about -PRON- place
the first time -PRON- go be a wonderful time
great food great service and price be just right
second time be very lack luster
after the great time -PRON- have last time -PRON- think to bring -PRON- family because of -PRON- high expectation
this time -PRON- be greet by the hostess who take -PRON- name down say 15 20 min wait
-PRON- be wait for some time and after 20 -PRON- think ok -PRON- be busy so whatev that can not be help
as -PRON- notice further there be people who just walk in and get a seat
-PRON- would like to say that these people be not one who have a reservation because -PRON- come in take there name down like -PRON- then
2min later be seat
-PRON- be forget plain and simple
-PRON- wait a little long to see if -PRON- would be notice
-PRON- happen again
then the last straw be that a group of 15 people walk in and be seat before -PRON-
the first girl the hostess seem alarmed that -PRON- be not seat and say oh my god
-PRON- forget -PRON-
-PRON- be not until another waitress come by and say that -PRON- have a reservation
-PRON- way -PRON- say that to -PRON- seem like -PRON- just do not care
the hostess see -PRON- to -PRON- seat right away
the waitress then have be much more enjoyable than the other one
-PRON- wish -PRON- get -PRON- name because -PRON- be very helpful and apologetic towards -PRON-
the food be wonderful and the price be great
other than the first encounter -PRON- be an enjoyable dinner
the third time be a nice evening
-PRON- be -PRON- and -PRON- boyfriend
seat in about 15 min on a busy wednesday night
the waitress be very attentive and get out order in and out in no time
kudo to the cook that night -PRON- steak be grill perfectly
overall -PRON- be not sure what to make of this place
the service seem to be a 50\/50 when -PRON- go in
the food be great and the price at that place just can not be beat
this store be so much more fun than -PRON- could have ever imagine
-PRON- be greet by a super friendly staff who help -PRON- put together a delicious pasta gift basket for -PRON- grandparent for christmas
-PRON- grandparent spend a lot of -PRON- retirement in ixtapa mexico and oil vinegar have sombrero shaped pasta
how cute be that
-PRON- will definitely be back
go here to redeem american casino guide coupon
from the outside the place look a bit seedy
parking be limit
but once inside -PRON- look much good
a cozy hub not ginormous and impersonal
the staff be friendly and helpful
-PRON- have all of the gaming machine -PRON- usually play
this be the first place -PRON- have know that use an atm to generate player club card
one of -PRON- favorite casino to visit
-PRON- can see why this place have good rating
and -PRON- so so so want to like -PRON-
-PRON- family and -PRON- have an awful experience here tonight
-PRON- sit at a table for about 15 minute with no waiter to even take a drink order
-PRON- decide to order to go think -PRON- would be fast since the table service be so slow
-PRON- wait hour after order -PRON- food
-PRON- finally ask how much longer only to find that -PRON- have not start the order
-PRON- be there an hour and a half total between all the waiting in line and wait for food
if that be not bad enough when -PRON- get home -PRON- husband and -PRON- both find several hairs in -PRON- food
gross
think back some of the cook have no hair cover
honestly the food look pretty good so if -PRON- do not mind wait over an hour for -PRON- food and get some bonus hair from the kitchen then -PRON- may like this place
-PRON- will not be return and would recommend to stay away
there be plenty of other good restaurant in the area
first time
-PRON- live across the street and finally get in to check -PRON- out
extremely friendly two young man behind the juice bar
great customer service skill and a overall awesome organic huge juice beverage

thank gentleman -PRON- will be back
this target have the bad customer service
-PRON- suck -PRON- have to go to this target almost everyday because -PRON- live right next to -PRON-
all the work be in a bad mood everyday
even the manager
the only nice one be the starbucks employee
the rest need to learn customer service
-PRON- need to learn to smile and not gossip so much with other worker while work
-PRON- hate come here
but -PRON- do not want to drive farther to go to walmart or another target
unfortunately inconsistent
-PRON- be a regular and -PRON- do love this place but lately there be be a sharp decline
the pork and chicken be inedible
the last three time -PRON- be just be piece of mush with scattered piece of burn tough pork or chicken
the chicken souvlaki be the only safe bet
the same with the salad
depend on who be make -PRON- depend on whether -PRON- be do right or not
the cretan be inconsistent
some time the rusk be crunchy and there be balsamic
sometimes there be no balsamic and soggy bread
-PRON- be a young male who just want a pretty simple haircut w\/ no styling so take this review with a grain of salt
however there be no wait the stylist understand exactly what -PRON- want and the whole deal only cost $ 13 plus tip
from what -PRON- understand this rate be reduce further to $ 10 on tuesdays
worth a look
bad parking ever
however aside from that the sushi! so amazing
the salmon be probably the most delicious -PRON- have have in awhile
very happy about that
the other roll be also pretty great
-PRON- recommend the -PRON- name roll if -PRON- like a bit of spicy bit not too overwhelming
overall i definitely enjoy the food here the ice cream sandwich be also great!. not the big fan of red bean but -PRON- definitely do not overpower the ice cream which be another plus
will be back to try the ayce kbbq next time :d
-PRON- recently have flower dilver to -PRON- wife for or anniversary
-PRON- have an arrangement send to the house on friday
and -PRON- ask for around a noon delivery -PRON- also have an arrangement send to the restaurant on saturday where -PRON- be take -PRON- wife to dinner for -PRON- anniversary
both arrangement where dilver on time and -PRON- be beautiful
-PRON- wife be surprised on friday with the flower but -PRON- also love -PRON- the next night when -PRON- show up to -PRON- favorite restaurant and be seat on time the second set of flower where wait on the table and be even more beautiful
needless to say -PRON- wife be very surprised
-PRON- will recommend springtime floral to all -PRON- friend and family
great product and top notch service
thank -PRON- springtime floral
-PRON- be normally an ayce sushi restaurant goer but -PRON- be nice to go to a normal japanese restaurant to try out high quality food
-PRON- be recommend to japango by many friend as a good decently price restaurant so -PRON- decide to give -PRON- a go
environment
the restaurant be locate around bay\/dunda but -PRON- be actually to the side of a small street so even though -PRON- have be around this area many many time -PRON- have never notice japango
on the inside the restaurant be super tiny
-PRON- can probably only accommodate 5 6 table at one time and for the people who have to wait the door do not have a lot of space to stand and wait so -PRON- be good to check ahead of time
the renovation be decent though and -PRON- could see the chef prepare the food just step in front of -PRON-
food
-PRON- get the chirashi don and the sea urchin sashimi
the chirashi don have a good variety of sashimi in the bowl and the japanese rice be really soft and chewy
the sashimi be definitely fresh than the one -PRON- normally eat at ayce restaurant so -PRON- be ok with pay a high price for -PRON- meal for $ 17
the sea urchin be interesting
-PRON- have never have sea urchin before
so -PRON- decide to try some here
-PRON- taste really slimy but do not really have much of a flavour on -PRON- so -PRON- do not think -PRON- would consider sea urchin to be a tasty dish
the price be quite steep at $ 14 for a little bit amount so -PRON- probably will not get -PRON- in the future after -PRON- know how -PRON- taste like
service
service be alright kinda like standard asian restaurant service but consider -PRON- be locate downtown with many non asian customer -PRON- be expect good service
however the service -PRON- receive when -PRON- actually need a server be good
in conclusion -PRON- be a nice experience go outside of -PRON- comfort zone and try a non ayce japanese restaurant once in a while
-PRON- would probably come back to try other item the next time -PRON- happen to be around the downtown area
fantastic aesthetic
lovely ambiance
service be friendly and considerate
the bathroom be private
the patio be small and sweet
the food
omg
the food be rich decadent and fresh
-PRON- have a shrimp appetizer some sort of rub on -PRON-
make -PRON- want to become a mermaid to go find all the shrimp in the sea and take -PRON- to the chef here to make all the yummy for -PRON- forever
the pull pork sandwich be huuugggeee like -PRON- butt be now from eat -PRON-
worth -PRON-
the fresh make donut
the order be huge
order one order for three ppl
-PRON- order two think -PRON- would share with -PRON- flock
nope
have enough for a small army
price be accessible
will be back everyday till -PRON- kick -PRON- out for wear mermaid costume in a cuban restaurant
if -PRON- be invite to attend a diamond resort invite turn it
down
first -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- want two hour of -PRON- time and that be a lie
-PRON- will try to pressure -PRON- into buy -PRON- time share until -PRON- see there be no hope or
-PRON- flat out tell -PRON- no
second once -PRON- see -PRON- be not interested -PRON- become very rude mean no handshake no farewell just rude to the point that -PRON- really want to go bonker and slap each and every rep for be associate with this company
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- be not a timeshare well folk that be all -PRON- be a timeshare
do not take -PRON- word give -PRON- a try and then decline
and that be when then horn come out and the pitchfork be brandish
another thing -PRON- need to know -PRON- require -PRON- to show -PRON- id and credit card
-PRON- do not take down -PRON- information but want to know if -PRON- have credit and how much -PRON- make
the more -PRON- make the more pressure -PRON- apply and the more sale rep come at -PRON-
there be piece of
-PRON- order -PRON- food at 2 a.m.
-PRON- arrive at 4:30am
est time of deliver be 45 minute
pretty upset because -PRON- pre tip otherwise -PRON- would have just close the door
gouda garlic bacon burger be awesome
the contain burger be even good
-PRON- be under construction with expansion but there be plenty of table outside bit the shade
this place be nestle in the mountain in a beautiful setting
the room be elegant and simple if the bed be a little firm
the food be good and reasonable and -PRON- get in on a really great deal for the room
unfortunately so do a host of family with rowdy kid
a beautiful relaxing evening by the pool be ruin because the staff clearly care not about the rule
many sign around the pool state the rule clearly yet the family continue to act like
well very uncouth for a resort setting
-PRON- would go back to this resort if the staff agree ahead of time to simply enforce the rule that be so plainly post everywhere
when deal with directly the staff be professional and friendly
stop in for lunch as -PRON- attempt last time for dinner be unsuccessful due to literally all item sell out save for one
lunch have a few menu item sell out too
-PRON- go with the drowning bull and -PRON- be delicious savoury noodle soup with beef brisket and generous garnish
restaurant set up be cut and simple up on the second floor
would recommend -PRON-
al donut 's be scrumptious
-PRON- stop by on -PRON- way to work this morning
-PRON- do not have a ton to choose from as -PRON- be already near to 8 a.m.
but -PRON- do notice some of the donut be large
the woman work the counter be very friendly
-PRON- choose a chocolate cake donut with chocolate frosting and -PRON- be yummy
for 80 cent -PRON- can not beat -PRON-
a small shop with hand write sign in the window
-PRON- have seat inside if one choose to eat there
-PRON- be nice to support a local business instead of one of those large chain who all taste the same
try -PRON- some time
meet up with mr kent p and michelle to check out this new spot and grab a quick bite to eat before a film
see that -PRON- be already late for dinner -PRON- order hastily something -PRON- think would be quick gourmet mac and cheese and would arrive at the same time as the other
-PRON- take more than 45 minute for -PRON- party 's food to arrive and then nearly another 15 minute for -PRON- to arrive wait staff guarantee -PRON- be come in less than 3 minute
unfortunately -PRON- slow pace make -PRON- so late for the movie bridesmaid -PRON- opt not to go
of the movie -PRON- want to see this year in theatre bridesmaids be probably 1
either way -PRON- be a really long wait for a restaurant that have about 10 patron
the gourmet mac and cheese be absolutely delicious but so rich
-PRON- could only eat a quarter of -PRON-
-PRON- would have be better suit as a side to some chicken or something
also -PRON- tardiness may have be excusable if -PRON- prepare the noodle from scratch boil -PRON- and then add the cheese but -PRON- think -PRON- just warm up a cold plate of mac and cheese to be expect
thank mugshot tavern but -PRON- ruin -PRON- only chance to see bridesmaid in the theater now what be -PRON- to do
what am -PRON- to do
well -PRON- try scratch again
-PRON- wish -PRON- could give -PRON- more star but -PRON- can not
in fact if -PRON- be not for the quality and actual taste of the food -PRON- would give this place 2.5 star
-PRON- have the croque madame and -PRON- be delicious
the chocolate croissant be also really good
but -PRON- be also small for the price
-PRON- friend have the vichysoisse and -PRON- be excellent
the service be definitely more attentive this time-- at least in term of there be a good ratio of server to patron
however of the 3 server who provide various thing to -PRON- while -PRON- be there 2 of -PRON- be great and one of -PRON- be not
while the third server do perform -PRON- duty -PRON- be not warm in any way
more importantly one thing that happen really put -PRON- off
and -PRON- be go to write the detail here but -PRON- have decide not to get into -PRON- in the interest of discretion
-PRON- will just say that one server be very rude to 2 elderly lady at the table next to -PRON-
very very rude
in the interest of fairness -PRON- will add that -PRON- 9-month old daughter do knock over and shatter a glass which be completely -PRON- fault and the rude server do clean -PRON- up and tell -PRON- not to worry about -PRON-
all in all -PRON- would say to go here for the pastry for sure and if -PRON- be go to get actual food carry out may be the good way to go
first time here and last time here
receive key to room -PRON- do not work and also notice door have be dust for finger print
hallway carpet be dirty and smelly
go to front desk and request a different room
be give another room which by the way be nice and clean
then a resort sale person call -PRON- room in the morning to book -PRON- a 90 presentation with some goody as giveaway
-PRON- go to -PRON- appointment and be tell that since -PRON- could not verify that -PRON- live at the same address with -PRON- partner of 10 + year -PRON- could not take tour
this be embarrassing to -PRON- and
-PRON- since -PRON- be tell in front of other
very disappointed with bluegreen club 36
the service be friendly
the hummus be good and -PRON- like the olive oil on the dish
the pitta bread be not of the high quality and taste little stale
-PRON- order the beef kabob and be disappoint -PRON- wish -PRON- order the chicken kabob instead -PRON- be not as soft as -PRON- would hope for
on the other hand the rice yellow basmati be very good and nicely flavor
-PRON- be so much rice that -PRON- could not finish -PRON-
over all -PRON- give -PRON- 3 star because the quality of the beef on the kabob
this review be specifically for the road bike fit that -PRON- have with doug britton at this shop
-PRON- have be rid for 8 year now and have have multiple bike fit
-PRON- be the most comprehensive fit -PRON- have have
doug be very detailed orient and help -PRON- eliminate -PRON- knee pain when riding
-PRON- hope that anyone consider get -PRON- bike fit go to this shop and have doug help -PRON- out
on a side note be sure to check out the thursday night mountain bike
-PRON- be a lot of fun
contrary to most reviewer -PRON- have a great experience with supershuttle go there and back
go there -PRON- supershuttle be on time and -PRON- even notify -PRON- by cell to let -PRON- know what time -PRON- would arrive
go back home -PRON- be delay and have miss -PRON- original supershuttle
but -PRON- be able to catch a different one just as -PRON- be about to leave
the supershuttle agent who be at the airport be super nice and say -PRON- be around 24\/7
so -PRON- be not sure why the other reviewer have a different experience
-PRON- be about 11:10pm
the waygu beef meatloaf be awesome
wander in on a rainy thursday night
top notch service and great food
starter be the raw deal which be spicy tuna on sticky rice with avocado mousse and caviar also very good
-PRON- do not serve alcohol but diner can bring -PRON- own
-PRON- do not know if there be a corkage fee
seem a bit pricy but definitely worth -PRON-
have brunch on a sunday
the table be wipe with a dirty cloth and -PRON- could smell the bacteria on the table
tap water be serve in nice wine bottle
the brunch food be good quality with good presentation but the toast be paper thin and too well do
the service be very good and the waiter be cheery
the price be standard for brunch
-PRON- be not sure what the quality of chinese food that be available in phoenix so for this city maybe the food here be good
-PRON- be from vancouver where there be a chinese restaurant on every block the wild ginger would sit empty
the food be bland the price be high the service be average
not a good combination for a successful business
do not order wonton
-PRON- be terrible kungpao
bland dumplings taste like cook oil
honestly this place need a cooking makeover
very nice restaurant -PRON- server
matt be friendly genuine and knowledgeable
the food be great the mac and cheese be amazing
-PRON- try -PRON- at every restaurant -PRON- go to can not wait to go back
-PRON- sign up because -PRON- think -PRON- would have receive good training than -PRON- do at the new ufc gym nearby
ufc gym be brand new when -PRON- join and this one almost as new but seem to have more experienced trainer and even a good facility
this be especially for the grappling which -PRON- do not do as -PRON- have huge domur mat for many to train on
also have an octagon which be not use at all at least while -PRON- be there
-PRON- first boxing session with jamie varner 's personal boxing coach be the good one by far as -PRON- be the only one there that day
-PRON- get to train a few more session with -PRON- until -PRON- decide to only train jamie and other pro
-PRON- sometimes do the kickbox class but prefer more the boxing with -PRON- but now that -PRON- be not there any longer -PRON- be not the same
-PRON- start go less and less until -PRON- be not worth to continue pay for -PRON-
so -PRON- quit
now the shitty part be that cancel be a big hassle since -PRON- take forever for -PRON- to put -PRON- in touch with the person that could terminate -PRON- membership
after do so -PRON- charge -PRON- a $ 99 cancellation fee which -PRON- never agree to nor be inform about but say that -PRON- be in the contract
-PRON- be completely mislead and tell -PRON- be under a month to month membership when -PRON- originally sign up
jamie be a nice guy even though -PRON- do not talk to -PRON- much and love training with -PRON- boxing coach
-PRON- think this mma gym have some really good potential but lack professionalism and decent management
if -PRON- be someone who actually give a shite about the quality and wholesomeness of -PRON- food -PRON- have to try nourish
clean high energy food
gluten free and very creative
the owner of this place obviously have heart
-PRON- understand the menu will be completely soy free soon and also offer some paleolithic option very very interesting
come here for a weekend with 2 of -PRON- girlfriend be tell by 3 different people to check this spot out so -PRON- reserve a table for dinner saturday night at 10 p.m.
wait 30 min to be seat kitchen close at 11 p.m.
hostess offer if -PRON- would like to eat at the bar in because -PRON- can not kick people off -PRON- table

finally -PRON- get seat all the way in the back in a total separate part of the restaurant the table be
strange one side be a booth the other side be chair

-PRON- waiter be beyond amazing -PRON- be so attentive super sweet friendly

i get basic pasta with tomato basil evoo
pasta be a bit too al dente but very flavorful
-PRON- stay after dinner for the night party which be not -PRON- scene at all

-PRON- be a fun\/interest experience but not sure if i would return
this place be walk distance if -PRON- be stay in new york new york
-PRON- be literally right out the door
there be 2 area to order from when -PRON- walk in here
there be the food window and then there be the bar in the middle
-PRON- have to order food at the window and drink at the bar
-PRON- will not combine the two
-PRON- get the brat for -PRON- entree
and -PRON- think -PRON- be delicious

lol lot of onion
-PRON- do not mind -PRON-
-PRON- also try -PRON- pickle and pretzel dipper
pretzel dipper be nothing out of the ordinary but -PRON- do really like the pickle
-PRON- go to los on a slow tuesday night
-PRON- take over 5 minute for someone to take -PRON- drink order and another 5 minute to get -PRON- drink
the waitress have to cone back two time to clarify -PRON- order
-PRON- order taco and the chicken enchilada
both be incredibly bland no flavor at all
when -PRON- be charge 17 $ for a dish -PRON- have higer expectation
the good part of -PRON- meal be the bean
ins short
bad service boring food
-PRON- will not be go back
great grill food always a line but -PRON- move quick one of -PRON- favorite
alot of people think this place be a dog park
there be dog crap everywhere as -PRON- walk around the mile long concrete path as most people seem to ignore the bag that be provide
-PRON- have a run in with a large poodle owner also who think -PRON- be special let -PRON- dog roam around without a leash
-PRON- know giant poodle be not dangerous but -PRON- have see pit bull and big dog off leash too
these snob who live in north scottsdale be pathetic and immature and think -PRON- be above the law
this be a soccer complex so put -PRON- ugly dog on a lease and pick up -PRON- crap
or maybe -PRON- will come over to -PRON- yard and drop a load right there too
while visit arizona this be where -PRON- decide to go for dinner one night

and -PRON- must say -PRON- be disappointed
-PRON- can see patty 's early review from a more foody pt of view but -PRON- view be that -PRON- be try to cut corner by use a cheap white cream fill to almost all of -PRON- macaroon result in a very unauthentic cute lil thing that be ok to look at but horrible to eat
-PRON- guess the price do reflect quality when -PRON- come to macaroon
and -PRON- must go
r***o again if -PRON- ever have another craving for macaroon
heather be a gifted stylist and ground and wise beyond -PRON- year

portion size be good enough that two of -PRON- be full from just two dish
-PRON- certainly would be interested in order again
food be also reasonably price since -PRON- be accustom to much more expensive price
overall -PRON- would recommend this place

when a lane be open to accommodate -PRON- party -PRON- range master take -PRON- there
-PRON- occupy two lane to make -PRON- shooting session run smoothly
the range master be very helpful throughout -PRON- whole entire session
-PRON- do get burn by one of -PRON- ak47 shell since -PRON- be wear a basketball jersey
at the end of -PRON- session everyone get a free shirt except for -PRON-
moral of the story get a package
-PRON- be a good value and -PRON- get a free shirt
but -PRON- do have fun
this do not seem to be an ordinary saloon but rather a multi use venue on fremont street in downtown las vegas
-PRON- be a big open room with a stage and a bar
when -PRON- be in town for a an event the lvcs host private party for -PRON- group two night in a row
the first night drink have to be purchase at the venue 's bar at $ 8 a beer -PRON- only have one and do not stick around for long
the second night be much more fun several keg pay for by registration fee be open to attendee
there be a lot of space in here and not a lot of seating
great for dance or watch a band -PRON- guess except that the acoustic be crap
also this be not the easy place to find--
-PRON- be locate on the second level above fremont street across from heart attack grill but seem to lack any kind of obvious signage indicate what -PRON- be or how to go about get inside hint look for the escalator
-PRON- sure would not go out of -PRON- way to return to this place but if -PRON- be in town for another event that be host a party here -PRON- be good enuf
-PRON- have be a few time but never eat here
the weird thing be the signage and name bruno mali 's hidden house kind of make -PRON- think -PRON- may be go to a cool funky lounge
nope
on one side there be whatev excuse for musical what not be go on
other than be too loud -PRON- seem to be just fine for those who like that noise
-PRON- loathe hip hop\/rap\/whatever -PRON- be call -PRON- these day
so -PRON- hang on the other side
the bar side be huge pool table video crack and the like
the bartender be friendly enough but -PRON- do not feel right or smell right for that matter
numero uno -PRON- need to tone down the lighting
follow by a supreme bleaching and re orginization of space
and -PRON- would have something
also the drink be the right price
one point for cheap drink
one point for friendly bar staff on the non music side
-PRON- would be remiss not to mention that the one time -PRON- be in here
solo
-PRON- feel the need to be hyper aware as a lone female
this little italian place tuck away in west las vegas be absolutely awesome
-PRON- be a decent drive away from las vegas locate close to spring valley
as the other have say the garlic bread be absolutely spectacular just the perfect touch to any meal
the food be quite authentic and will not disappoint
the meatball be extremely tender and the pasta be very fresh
for any coffee lover the expresso here be very good as well
there be not a single thing on the menu that -PRON- would shy away from
as for the environment the interior be quite cozy and good for a time out with friend or maybe even a casual date
the noise be not too loud nor be -PRON- awkwardly quiet which make -PRON- easy to catch up and maintain a conversation
the service be good however at peak time -PRON- seem like -PRON- be understaffed
the wait can sometimes be long if -PRON- do not call in advance for reservation
nonetheless -PRON- be worth the wait
also the parking lot be quite small so -PRON- have to plan some time in advance to get a space or to park in the surround neighborhood
this place be wonderful
-PRON- have no idea what the bag review be talk about
everything on the drink menu -PRON- try be make extremely well and do not skimp on the alcohol
the piri piri wing and meatball on the tapas part of the menu be really spectacular
everyone be very nice and accommodate
-PRON- would easily recommend this place to anyone
the only caveat -PRON- have be in regard to the grill octopus
-PRON- be unimpressed with the sauce and confuse with the pairing of octopus and potato
other than that -PRON- can not speak highly enough of this place
das essen ist wirklich sehr gut
momentan kommt die bedienung mit einem körbchen frischer pfiferlinge um die verschiedenen gerichte mit pfiferlingsoße anzubieten
ist mal be andere
die bedienung ist sehr freundlcih und
-PRON- be voraus gibt

though the food be decent the service be absolutely terrible
after wait for over an hour to get a table -PRON- be finally sit in a table that be too small for -PRON- group
-PRON- request to get a small table add to where -PRON- be sit there be an empty table next to -PRON- and the man assist -PRON- persist to say under -PRON- breath -PRON- have get to be kid -PRON-
the bad part about the entire situation be that the man be the manager so there be no body else that -PRON- could express -PRON- complaint to
extremely disappointing experience
the strength of this sdm be also -PRON- weakness

the instructor be so energetic and positive
the locker room smell great and have amazing lighting
however -PRON- do wish -PRON- offer class with dance such as zumba or a class similar to that
karben 4 be -PRON- favorite type of microbrew but the service the bartender give be terrible
-PRON- seem so confused at how to pour -PRON- a beer and how to serve -PRON-
-PRON- give an extra star because -PRON- like -PRON- beer
the food taste like -PRON- microwave -PRON- and -PRON- take more than an hour on a non busy day to bring the food to the bar
adorable interior friendly knowledgeable staff and fudgy
delicious double chocolate brownie
-PRON- intend to get back to vanilla to try -PRON- other treat soon specifically the peppermint patty brownie
-PRON- be so excited to have -PRON- own hash house in henderson -PRON- look like if these review continue -PRON- will not have one much long
-PRON- have be to this location twice
the first time -PRON- be very busy so -PRON- think that explain the slow service
but upon return to a half empty restaurant -PRON- wait over 10 minute to be seat another 10 to be greet and drink order take
food be cold one person in -PRON- party order be totally wrong
no apology -PRON- have to ask for the egg to be correct

-PRON- go there specifically for the damn b3 burrito -PRON- say -PRON- weren't have it that day
come back the next day
and they say the same thing
-PRON- be pretty upset why advertise -PRON- if -PRON- not even go to make -PRON-
also the burger that -PRON- order be extremely over cook like charcoal taste nasty
although the nice waiter -PRON- have take -PRON- off -PRON- bill -PRON- seem like -PRON- be way to busy to really remember people who need refill ranch ect get annoying
will not be go back ever
schöner großer zoo und toll für einen familienausflug
man sollte schon einen ganzen tag einplanen wenn man alle sehen will
die gehege sind großzügig und scheinen tiergerecht zu sein
der eintrittspreis ist angemessen so viele tiere wollen versorgt werden

-PRON- feel like -PRON- be overrate
everything be pretty
stunning visually
but taste be okay
-PRON- have coffee and 3 different brioche
the brioche dulce de leche blueberry and nutella be too sweet for -PRON- taste
-PRON- do see savory crepe at a table next to -PRON- and wish -PRON- have go that route
-PRON- look amazing
-PRON- have be to this location three time and order wing each time
once -PRON- be cook perfectly

be tell there would be a 25 min wait which be hard with -PRON- special need twin but instead -PRON- wait over 45 minute meanwhile 2 top be walk in be seat speak to the manager who be rude be not willing to put 2 top together
needless to say -PRON- food may be good but who care with that wait attitude -PRON- can get breakfast anywhere

-PRON- check out the menu online ahead of time since -PRON- have never be here
beer selection be lack but hh food look promising

-PRON- opt for a mixed drink which be serve in the tiny glass miss the lime -PRON- request

tasteless and bun be brush with excessive oil or butter
-PRON- finally get the waitress attention for another drink order a flatbread
the flatbread never come
-PRON- have already give up do not even bother ask what happen
-PRON- entire group could have double -PRON- drink order have the waitress be available
-PRON- park -PRON- in front of the kitchen window or be mia
sorry too many other option nearby will not be back
this place be horrible do not waste -PRON- time or -PRON- money food be not all that great chicken seem a little bit undercooked the staff be just a bunch of kid that like to stand around and not do anything every time -PRON- look up at the television in front of -PRON- just watch the ball game -PRON- feel like -PRON- be star at -PRON- because there be about 10 of -PRON- stand there star back at -PRON- definitely not a place -PRON- will come to -PRON- again
-PRON- food and drink be fine even though order be never successfully process
-PRON- tell the man at the register several time -PRON- have a dairy allergy but of course -PRON- breakfast come out with melted cheese all over -PRON-
when -PRON- come out the second time -PRON- have no cheese but be the wrong order -PRON- just eat -PRON- because at this point -PRON- want to get outta there
meh
if -PRON- could do zero -PRON- would
-PRON- discrimat against -PRON-
-PRON- -PRON- would expire next year
-PRON- say -PRON- be 3 year too old
-PRON- ask for a manager -PRON- ignore -PRON- and -PRON- do not get into what -PRON- pay for party bus crawl tour
apparently -PRON- need an id and passport to get in
definitely not what -PRON- expect and not what -PRON- recommend
-PRON- husband take -PRON- to raul theresa 's for lunch on valentine day
the whole experience be so beautiful and romantic
-PRON- get -PRON- in right away -PRON- waitress be so friendly and get -PRON- food to -PRON- quickly
-PRON- have the good chip and salsa ever
-PRON- have the most amazing spanish musician serenade everyone at the perfect pitch and volume -PRON- even take and know a couple request
but by far the most amazing part of the entire visit be this guy old gentleman
-PRON- think -PRON- say gregory be -PRON- name
watch -PRON- work and -PRON- attentiveness to back up the staff on a busy day with -PRON- customer -PRON- think for sure this must be the owner
as -PRON- end -PRON- wonderful experience -PRON- ask -PRON- waitress be that the owner and -PRON- say no -PRON- be a busser
-PRON- call -PRON- over before -PRON- leave and tell -PRON- -PRON- have think -PRON- be the owner -PRON- laugh and say no
-PRON- tell -PRON- then if -PRON- be not the owner -PRON- must be work for the lord -PRON- smile and say yes -PRON- be everytime
-PRON- tell -PRON- if -PRON- own a restaurant -PRON- would offer -PRON- a job at the high level because clearly this be not an average worker -PRON- work in excellence
thank -PRON-
raul theresa be for a wonderful romantic valentine experience and thank -PRON- for the beautiful rose on -PRON- way out the door
-PRON- can not wait to come back
-PRON- have no idea what all the hype over this place be about
the food be terrible and the attitude to go with -PRON- be even bad
-PRON- be all for the concept of eat fresh locally and sustainably but the menu offering miss the mark
almost everything on the menu be fat laden exotic and way over price
-PRON- think this place could be significantly improve by offer a few healthy option
for $ 33 -PRON- have chicken cordon blu farmhouse nachos and a cinnamon roll cupcake
the $ 3.00 cupcake be absolutely hand down the bad pastry -PRON- have ever hand
-PRON- have no resemblance to a cupcake and be so dry out\/hard that the texture remind -PRON- of tasteless shortbread cookie
the nachos be not good either
basically -PRON- be a pile of chip with some tasteless shredded beef a huge gob of melted cheese and the occasional jalapeño or olive
the chicken cordon blu be almost unidentifiable
perhaps -PRON- should have go with the 3,000 calorie three meat scallop potato entree
-PRON- wish -PRON- could support local and this place be a neat idea but -PRON- honestly have to say that -PRON- would never patronize this place again even if -PRON- be the only restaurant within a 100 mile radius
-PRON- be a girl who be new to vegas and who know nothing about car so -PRON- be always worried -PRON- be go to get screw over and over charge to fix something simple
fortunately someone recommend circle of friend to -PRON-
-PRON- come over and rich help -PRON- out right away
-PRON- tell -PRON- what be wrong with -PRON- car for free and tell -PRON- the part -PRON- need to fix -PRON- car and the cheap price -PRON- could get -PRON- for
-PRON- end up go home and find the part half off on amazon
because -PRON- be a huge cheapo -PRON- call around to other company just to make sure -PRON- be go to get the good price and other company be go to charge over $ 115 to install the same part and -PRON- only charge -PRON- $ 60
-PRON- do not take -PRON- as long to install the part as -PRON- though so -PRON- charge -PRON- $ 5 cheap than the price -PRON- have originally quote -PRON-
-PRON- be just really down to earth and really honest
-PRON- will even sit with -PRON- and talk to -PRON- about what be go on with -PRON- car and tell -PRON- what -PRON- option be and and let -PRON- make -PRON- own decision on how -PRON- want to proceed with out push -PRON- into expensive repair
-PRON- would 100 recommend -PRON- to anyone
be new in town
-PRON- be so glad -PRON- find a circle of friend
if there be 0 star -PRON- would like to give -PRON- 0
-PRON- have order delivery from -PRON-
-PRON- driver be a little scam artist and do not have any change
what sort of delivery guy do not have change
-PRON- part of -PRON- job
so -PRON- get a big ass tip

but the waitress say no cuz the table be too small can not sit three girl what a bullshit.there be like 10 table

-PRON- will never go again also -PRON- will make sure -PRON- friend will not got scam in there too
update -PRON- see more -PRON- three guy sit in -PRON- patio this afternoon when -PRON- be pass -PRON- restaurant

so rude and unprofessional
-PRON- go to lunch at the melt in lakewood and take a hike
of course -PRON- find this chocolatier and -PRON- be joyful to walk in and sample -PRON- delightful selection of beautifully present and tasty chocolate
a very nice surprise
the salted caramel delish orange rind dip in dark chocolate devine and the chocolate covered ginger yummy
just to name a few pick
the staff be extremely knowledgable and make -PRON- visit as pleasant and memorable as possible
after chat and make -PRON- selection -PRON- tell -PRON- that one of the astronauts take -PRON- chocolate with -PRON- into space
-PRON- ask who of course since -PRON- know an astronaut that be on the last hubble spacecraft launch but -PRON- would not say now -PRON- must find out
aside from -PRON- history everything be very pretty fresh and tasty
have recommend this dentist in the past
dr tan be by far the good dentist in vegas
-PRON- explain everything and be very caring towards -PRON- patient
underwhelm give the hype this restaurant have receive
service be slow
beet cure mackeral be completely flavorless
chucuturie plate be a joke and plat as such
beef jerkey look more like a small piece of sausage
clams be serve with burn not char toast
entree be not bad but -PRON- could clearly see technical flaw likely from a lack of knowledgeable cook or a lack of attention to detail
not really a public course
-PRON- charge $ 80 just to practice
could not hit the range or practice green without pay
staff be arrogant
-PRON- should have stay in cali
amazing breakfast great quality and lot of choice
if -PRON- get the opportunity to go to this location ask to sit in savannah 's section
-PRON- be an absolute pleasure
-PRON- think origins have some of the good skin care product on the market
-PRON- have be use -PRON- cleanser and moisturizer for year
-PRON- think check and balance be -PRON- top sell cleanser -PRON- be great on the skin and will last forever as -PRON- only need a little for a good cleaning
another one of -PRON- favorite be the spot remover' miracle in a jar for any type of bump or blemish
other than this store and belk southpark the product tend to be hard to find in a store
-PRON- usually send coupon around the holiday which be great because -PRON- product can be pricey
-PRON- love -PRON- breakfast burrito and the shredded beef taco
always delicious and fresh tasting
the price be very reasonable
-PRON- live out of state
and -PRON- always stop in here when -PRON- be visit
-PRON- do recommend call in -PRON- order because -PRON- be very popular and -PRON- may have a long wait to get -PRON- food
-PRON- be worth the wait though
warn on the shredded beef taco -PRON- be a bit greasy
that can be a plus or minus depend on -PRON- personal taste
-PRON- think -PRON- be perfect
if -PRON- be one of the low fat heath food only crowd -PRON- probably should not be eat here anyway
-PRON- be natural

-store always loud which be why i stop attend workshop offer -only plus be store open till 11 p.m. -please hire more tech support to fix computer instead of wait day
-PRON- grandkid and -PRON- love the way the staff change the food tray and keep food fresh and -PRON- love the prime rib
-PRON- love all there food 5 star and for the price
-PRON- think the challenge be to be brief -PRON- have hear about the $ 450 super deluxe and -PRON- be a little panicked when -PRON- find out that -PRON- wife make reservation for -PRON- anniversary
turn out that there be some other prix fixe option and that make this place reachable for -PRON- public servant
the food be out of this world delicious and the presentation make the food almost impossible to eat as -PRON- feel like this be not mean to be put into -PRON- cake hole
as with most french cook the portion be not enormous however -PRON- have no shame in fill up on the other stuff
-PRON- have a bread service with about 20 different kind of bread
do not be shy about take multiple or ask for second
-PRON- be all part of the package and amazing
at the end of the meal come the sweet cart
another opportunity to glut out and get -PRON- money 's worth
-PRON- already pay for -PRON-
-PRON- have a feeling that the dish change so comment or recommend any specific one may be silly
every dish -PRON- have be absolute perfection
every entree also come with the famous mash potato
do not take this as an insult but -PRON- know those instant mash potato that -PRON- get from the cafeteria as a kid
-PRON- have this silky smooth texture that mom could never duplicate
when -PRON- first take a bite that be the thought that come to -PRON- mind
-PRON- be a lovely comforting think from childhood but the taste be like nothing else
-PRON- do not think -PRON- can pick out all the flavor that make this dish world famous
what set this place apart from any other restaurant -PRON- have every be to or will ever go to be the service
everyone in the restaurant have a role and from the butter service to the bread service all the dish of the meal and the sweet cart all of the part move smoothly elegantly and professionally
-PRON- would recommend this for any foodie
even if -PRON- do a small menu -PRON- be pretty affordable
-PRON- be a once in a lifetime experience

-PRON- definitely take half of the burger home for a snack later on
with -PRON- price though -PRON- make sense to have big portion
extremely over price but expect
especially on -PRON- drink
while the drink be tasty and fun to drink very expensive for the volume and quality -PRON- get
with a large party would go here again
solid selection for lunch a good amount of space to fit big party and central on the strip
-PRON- be such a cozy café -PRON- almost feel @home

-PRON- have high expectation and -PRON- be a bit of a let down
-PRON- have the sage fry chicken with biscuit and scramble egg
-PRON- egg be drown in maple syrup and the biscuit be hard and dry but the chicken be juicy and flavorful
-PRON- do not think -PRON- would go back again
go to give 5 star because -PRON- like the company and the staff be always awesome but this store be not up to speed yet base on the flow of other location

-PRON- offer a great student discount which include chip and a drink
-PRON- read previous review about ant in the soda machine
so -PRON- be extremely cautious

well still wait for that call
-PRON- favorite coffee shop in vegas for the vibe there
love the live music every time -PRON- have be
sometimes -PRON- can get crowd and -PRON- have have to wait for seat
once -PRON- have a milf snap at -PRON- in line because -PRON- take more than 2 second to decide on which macaron -PRON- want
-PRON- do not even ask and go right in front of -PRON- in line as -PRON- be admire the macaron
pretty normal for some people from this neighborhood -PRON- suppose
the macaron be smooth and a tiny bite of perfection
if -PRON- do not mind calorie this place be great
but -PRON- do not have as many sugar free option for tea latte or latte like -PRON- competitor
these folk be really fun to watch
if -PRON- really just want to see some fun artist do there thing these folk be the one -PRON- want
-PRON- watch -PRON- every time -PRON- get a chance
each one of -PRON- do -PRON- differently
-PRON- can spend hour watch -PRON-
finally get to try the place
miss out on a friday night because -PRON- do not seat people after 10 p.m. even though -PRON- close at 12 a.m.
-PRON- last call be at 10 p.m.
come back on a sunday night the place be full
there be a wait
but -PRON- be not too long about 5 10minute
-PRON- like this restaurant franchise because -PRON- have a great variety of soup base and food available
but at this location the beef be not as soft as other -PRON- be pretty dry
the beef cheese ball and the shrimp ball be still really good
the vegetable be really fresh
the service be really slow the food be not as good as expect
-PRON- skip a lot of the thing -PRON- order and -PRON- have to order -PRON- multiple time before -PRON- come
as for the washroom -PRON- be very messy and could have be better maintain
-PRON- prefer -PRON- other location good because -PRON- have a good experience there
p.s. cash only
this place have some wonderful food
the arepas be fill with crispy pork and the sauce that come with -PRON- be delicious
-PRON- love the spicy sauce -PRON- think -PRON- may have habanero in -PRON- -PRON- burn -PRON- lip in a good way
then -PRON- be cool off with the avocado cream sauce
the chicken be beyond delicious
do not forget to try the rib -PRON- mean fall off the bone
oh -PRON- almost forget the plantain be like little sweet fry pocket
-PRON- love the cheese empanadas and the tequenos fry cheese stick
-PRON- daughter say next time -PRON- need a dozen
-PRON- will be back for sure
thank goodness for yelp
great customer service or at least -PRON- think
the people be so nice -PRON- literally think -PRON- have -PRON- good interest at heart
-PRON- be almost sucker into buy 2 new air conditioner for $ 20,000.00
oh wait -PRON- be go to help -PRON- by give -PRON- an srp rebate which -PRON- would get no matter who -PRON- buy a unit with
this be from srp not -PRON- company
oh and to help -PRON- with the expensive a $ 3200 visa gift card to be fair
one of -PRON- ac unit stop work when -PRON- be 107 degree of course -PRON- panic
pleasantly surprised when -PRON- say -PRON- could have someone out that day
the capacitor go out on one unit and then -PRON- want to replace 2 other item total over $ 1200
at that point -PRON- be like
do -PRON- spend that much money on a 12 year old unit or be -PRON- time to get replace
-PRON- say -PRON- would send an ac sale representative out to let -PRON- know what option -PRON- have to make an informed decision
how nice right
wrong
-PRON- almost buy 2 new ac unit total $ 20,000
-PRON- be sick to -PRON- stomach think about -PRON- and start to do -PRON- own research
with all the review -PRON- see on yelp
-PRON- figure -PRON- need to get a second opinion
another company come out and say everything be fine
if -PRON- be not break do not fix -PRON-
capacitor be a very common item to go out in an ac unit
especially in az due to -PRON- extreme heat
also one unit have nothing to do with the other and even if one unit be beyond repair no need to replace both unit
-PRON- guess -PRON- take -PRON- kindness as away to take advantage of a single woman in distress
-PRON- sal representative even tell -PRON- -PRON- have a daughter shortly go off to college
how would -PRON- like someone to take advantage of -PRON- daughter like that
shame on -PRON-
-PRON- know -PRON- have to put -PRON- day through college but no reason to do -PRON- by take advantage of other
since -PRON- be already off work for the day -PRON- also have -PRON- plumber come out and fix 2 item in -PRON- home
again -PRON- be very nice and job complete
after do research on the ac 's -PRON- decide to look into the plumbing repair
-PRON- learn what -PRON- pay for and realize how much -PRON- be overcharge for fix these item as well
-PRON- be very smart when -PRON- invoice -PRON-
there be just a set fee
the receipt do not itemize part and labor
the plumber also try talk -PRON- into a water soft system and use a scare tactic to try to get -PRON- to buy a new water heater for $ 1694.00
again do some research and find water heater be half this price
-PRON- will say that everyone be very pleasant and kind when -PRON- be work with -PRON-
-PRON- feel that -PRON- really be try to help -PRON-
only to find out -PRON- see a sucker and almost get away with -PRON-
-PRON- be write this review to let other know thank -PRON- for -PRON- review
thank -PRON- for save -PRON- from almost spend half -PRON- life saving for unnecessary repair
do -PRON- research
do not let a stressful situation influence -PRON- on make a huge financial mistake
do not take kindness as someone look out for -PRON-
be aware and educate -PRON-
this place have really yummy food

the waiter -PRON- usually get -PRON- believe -PRON- be the son be very jovial and kind

upcharge for bread refill price be high for the portion -PRON- never have leftover from roma cafe and -PRON- always have leftover anywhere else
while the waitstaff be friendly -PRON- be generally very slow
last time -PRON- go in a small group of 6 -PRON- be there for a solid 2 hour because -PRON- just never check back
-PRON- guess -PRON- assume if -PRON- be talk -PRON- be not do
the old woman owner\/owner 's wife be rather unpleasant and do not seem happy about be there
-PRON- say be -PRON- go to place because -PRON- will not be back after last weekend

-PRON- be get out of the car at 7:55 and the old woman poke -PRON- head out and make that um yeah face
-PRON- fiancé confusedly ask if -PRON- be close and -PRON- just nod and say
yeah sorry though -PRON- be more of sorry not sorry
-PRON- have a special pet peeve spot in -PRON- brain for business who do not adhere to -PRON- own hour
if -PRON- live any distance make sure to call first
-PRON- can not say enough good thing about this dealership
-PRON- be ethical informative and exceed all of -PRON- expectation
if -PRON- want great service and great pricing contact anthony and mike at chapman hyundai -PRON- fly in from oc just to do business with these guy

also lot of kudo to jp in finance who be very thorough in explain -PRON- finance option and additional extended hyundai warranty coverage option
rich
beautiful space well think out and the room be stunning
however the clientele skew very young at least this particular weekend and that make this place too much of a scene for -PRON-
-PRON- will continue to stay at the bellagio and walk over to the cosmopolitan for dinner\/drink on occasion unless -PRON- get a rate good enough to convince -PRON- to stay here

as a specialty market this really be as good as -PRON- get especially in da burgh
-PRON- have be to salem 's in oakland once seek a specific item and the staff there be incredibly helpful and when -PRON- do not have what -PRON- be look for -PRON- make a few good suggestion on where to find -PRON-
the check out guy be not only warm and friendly but rather dreamy to look at as well
and then way back

-PRON- will be back to buy meat

once home -PRON- yank off a chicken leg and thigh from the rotisserie chicken and start dip into the hummous
the chicken be perfect juicy and beautifully season in -PRON- own marinade true yum
the hummous be excellent for a basic hummous
-PRON- like -PRON- a bit more on the garlic\/lemon\/olive oil side but -PRON- certainly be not bland and boring and the free pita be perfect with -PRON-
-PRON- friend message -PRON- that what -PRON- have get be just as yummy and -PRON- have enough to last several day

-PRON- have bun bo hue and -PRON- signature wrap with the beef both be beyond delicious
the atmosphere be a bit plain but the food make up for -PRON-
-PRON- property management team have send many job to maddy 's over the last several year
from simple chemical only recur weekly service to very pricey reseal job and everything in between
since the fall of 2012 customer service have drastically change and due to staffing turnover at least 1 work order and several request for quote that -PRON- send be completely overlook
there be never any attempt to correct the lapse of service due to -PRON- drop the ball even when -PRON- be specifically ask for only a dry apology at good for the mistake be give
the invoicing department do little more then send a blank email with an invoice attach even a template form email would go mile in the customer service department
techs often suggest costly repair on average of every 3 month that should only be need annually especially with weekly service from professional maintain the pool and equipment
after be bill for a full month of full cleaning service in which the property only receive 2 actual visit of the 4 -PRON- decide -PRON- be time to seek out a replacement for maddy 's as -PRON- grow portfolio will demand a high caliber of customer service
-PRON- put out a request for bid from over 20 pool company that -PRON- find through yelp and on google and get a reply from half of -PRON- in less then 12 hour all of which either beat or at least match the price -PRON- be pay at maddy 's
-PRON- would shop -PRON- pool service around before choose maddy 's pool supply and service
excellent quick service for replace crack iphone screen
good as new
would use again though hope -PRON- do not have to
the vibe at the reception and the lighting be great
the mc be very entertaining and get everyone involve
-PRON- really do not like focus on negative but for the purpose of an accurate review
-PRON- want an instrumental version of a song to play as -PRON- walk down the aisle but -PRON- play the regular version
when the officiant begin to speak the microphone be not work properly so none of -PRON- guest get to hear the ceremony
after the wedding -PRON- be suppose to meet up with ryan to get all copy of -PRON- photo booth picture but -PRON- avoid -PRON- text and would say -PRON- be free on a certain day but when that day arrive -PRON- would never hear back from -PRON-
-PRON- really wish -PRON- could have give a good rating for these guy but unfortunately -PRON- do not work out like that
-PRON- can not underestimate the level of gratitude that -PRON- have towards this move company
-PRON- call -PRON- under very short notice and in a time of great desperate need -PRON- be in no way able to perform this move by -PRON-
-PRON- cousin walk into the house and notice that -PRON- be try to pack up and load box into the car
-PRON- tell -PRON- that this would be nearly impossible and will take week to fully finish
-PRON- take out -PRON- phone and give -PRON- a number to this move company -PRON- be the good thing that could have happen to -PRON- this entire month
-PRON- be able to complete the move in less than 7 day and -PRON- could not be any more happy with this outcome
when -PRON- first open several year ago this use to be a good alternative to go to a regular sit down greek restaurant
mr. greek food and price unfortunately with fast food convenience
over the past couple year however the quality have go down dramatically to the point where -PRON- will not eat here anymore
on more than one occasion -PRON- have order the chicken souvlaki dinner and -PRON- have not taste like chicken
this be not an exaggeration -PRON- be actually taste like a cross between lunch meat and a sponge
-PRON- be guess this be cause by the half cook skewer sit in water\/brine for extended period of time prior to be flash grill and serve
if that be not bad enough the owner\/manager be an ass and -PRON- nickel and dime -PRON- for extra tzaziki
if -PRON- be pay 40 buck for a dinner for 2 at a semi fast food restaurant why do -PRON- need to charge -PRON- $ 1 for an extra teaspoon of yogurt
heed -PRON- advice and go to fire pit down the road instead
-PRON- will not be sorry
great gluten free option
the restaurant ambiance be lovely and cute
service be good and drink option be extensive
-PRON- order the short rib taco and really enjoy -PRON-
-PRON- friend order burger and enjoy -PRON- as well

great place to walk around on a saturday
-PRON- have do a lot walking shopping and search for food for a while so -PRON- have hit this place and one person from -PRON- party do not want to eat at franks brotwurst
-PRON- be sure -PRON- spell that wrong from the market
-PRON- absolutely have 0 tolerance with any spicy food
so -PRON- ask -PRON- to make -PRON- cold noodle none spicy at all and -PRON- taste still super good
so do the galbi come with -PRON-
-PRON- try some of -PRON- friend 's spicy kimchi jjim
-PRON- think -PRON- will become -PRON- favorite pork belly if -PRON- be a spicy food lover
will come back for sure such a great place for authentic korean food
the table be a little bit small :p
-PRON- be so disappointed with this clinic
just move in this area search online see this clinic have great review
call the office to schedule an meet and greet session with dr. kennedy but the receptionist krista say -PRON- do not have such session for new patient unless -PRON- be pregnant
then -PRON- ask -PRON- if -PRON- take -PRON- insurance the receptionist transfer -PRON- to the insurance coordinator margret
-PRON- ask for all -PRON- information and insurance info then ask -PRON- if -PRON- want to schedule an appointment
-PRON- say yes -PRON- want to schedule an appointment for -PRON- kid 's flu shot since -PRON- do not do greet and meet thing with doctor
margret say -PRON- can not schedule an appointment for -PRON- child if -PRON- be only for a flu shot
-PRON- have to be sick to see dr. kennedy
-PRON- be shocked
as a mom -PRON- want to make sure -PRON- have find a good pediatrician before -PRON- get sick
how can a child 's clinic make such policy
as a parent all -PRON- be try to do be to meet the doctor in person for 15 min ask a few question see if -PRON- be the one -PRON- could trust
but -PRON- make thing impossible for new patient and both lady -PRON- speak with have bad attitude and very impatient
so -PRON- have a craving for some chittlin so -PRON- go to m m soul food and order -PRON- because -PRON- have hear good thing about the restaurant
so -PRON- be all excited to get home and start grub
-PRON- open the container and strike one -PRON- have not be chop into small piece -PRON- be like -PRON- just put one big piece of intestine inside
strike two the collard green do not have any flavor and strike three mac n cheese be more mac than cheese
well -PRON- be all about second chance so -PRON- go back for shrimp and grit
this be absolutely terrible a few piece of shrimp no cheese and -PRON- still do not know what the hell the stuff be on top of -PRON- so needless to say -PRON- will not be eat there again
good value for the money

to make matter bad the meat have a mealy texture ewww
the rye be fresh though with a nice hard crust and soft innard
but -PRON- could not get past the meat
no kosher garlic pickle be include in the order
why not
imho rare roast beef should be bright red throughout and have a wet texture from be freshly slice
some blood not really blood0 should remain on the plate if -PRON- put a slice down for a sec
bud 's deli in sacramento slice -PRON- rb in front of -PRON- and -PRON- be absolutely perfect
-PRON- may go back to try a corned beef sandwich or the soup but at $ 20 for -PRON- sandwich -PRON- will definitely be a gamble the restaurant be in the mirage hotel and casino
really
do -PRON- just have the best prime rib dip sandwich at an airport
yes
-PRON- happen
this charming restaurant yes charming -PRON- even have a fireplace be locate in the middle of phoenix airport before go through the security line
-PRON- be impressed that -PRON- be able to pull off an environment that feel like a 5 star restaurant in the midst of all the hustle and bustle
the only time -PRON- be even remind that -PRON- be in an airport be when -PRON- see a few people with luggage under -PRON- table
service be first class food be a little pricy but typical of the airport menu be outstanding -PRON- be not mess around with -PRON- french fry
and there be even a free gourmet cookie before -PRON- leave
love -PRON-
-PRON- love the wonderful desert from sweets unlimited what a kind and sweet owner
-PRON- be a pleasure meet -PRON- and taste -PRON- delicious treat
-PRON- see this place walk inside of planet hollywood
and -PRON- think -PRON- would give -PRON- a try
-PRON- be very familiar with authentic and great mexican food
this however be neither
-PRON- be not terrible but definitely not go out of -PRON- way for
for the price -PRON- be not bad though if -PRON- be in need of something quick and affordable for the strip
-PRON- order the ceviche and chip
when people go to las vegas -PRON- generally return home with -PRON- wallet a little light than when -PRON- come
-PRON- be the nature of the town
-PRON- expect -PRON- be how las vegas even exist
aside from the leave part there be the take away part
for -PRON- -PRON- be come away with memory story and tall tale which be hard to come by anywhere else
the follow story cost -PRON- about $ 2,000 for three day
when -PRON- wait in line for a cab -PRON- have no idea what -PRON- be go to get and who will be behind the wheel
will -PRON- be the guy who drive in awkward silence even though -PRON- try to make small talk
will -PRON- be the guy who talk on -PRON- cell phone the entire time in a foreign language
will -PRON- be the overly aggressive driver who shout and cut in and out of traffic as if -PRON- be in a race for -PRON- life
or will -PRON- be the chatty guy who intentionally take the route down las vegas blvd even though -PRON- know good
and there be the driver -PRON- encounter from yellow cab on friday night who looked
a lot like jesus
if jesus look like jeff bridges the actor sport a full gray beard and go by the alia of michael witt driver 109790 and hail from oxnard california
yeah take that in for a few beat michael start off a little tight
-PRON- be the end of -PRON- shift and -PRON- seem a little grumpy
-PRON- take -PRON- time like a wily police detective with a crook in a confine interview room
-PRON- warm -PRON- up and then pull stuff out of -PRON-
michael have grow up in oxnard but relocate to las vegas 36 year ago
-PRON- have no desire to return to -PRON- birthplace or even california for that matter
-PRON- ask -PRON- if -PRON- miss the beach and -PRON- reply no
with that response -PRON- deduct there be more to -PRON- relocation from the beach community to the desert
-PRON- expect maybe -PRON- log some jail time maybe smuggle weed when any quantity of -PRON- be consider felonious or there could have be a nasty divorce
who know
there be something bad in cali and michael want nothing to do with -PRON-
nobody
but nobody do not want a beach
so michael reinvent -PRON- in las vegas as a jesus look a like in -PRON- mind eye after a few adult beverage
very cool
and the detective in -PRON- know -PRON- have completely break -PRON- down when -PRON- lay -PRON- good and only joke on -PRON-
wait for -PRON-
with a few more beat so -PRON- picture -PRON- as the kind of folk who be either go to see back street boys or brittney
be -PRON- right
try to subdue -PRON- cabbie cleverness but on the verge of crack up like a stoner who take one too many bong rip -PRON- reveal a true but ironically clever fact consider the whole look a like thing
no man -PRON- be see an ac\/dc tribute band -PRON- know who be play on fremont street
which have apparently slip michael 's mind when -PRON- briefly become carrot top because -PRON- be -PRON- proclaimed destination from the get go
michael as a cab driver be capable in the realm of slow mover who may have a shady past
-PRON- also take -PRON- straight down the strip through heavy traffic at 7:00 p.m.
-PRON- be so catch up with michael 's whole scene that -PRON- do not even mind as -PRON- type note into -PRON- iphone on the fly until -PRON- factor in how much -PRON- be go to tip -PRON-
in the scheme of -PRON- $ 2,000 contribution to the las vegas economy michael only get a tiny sliver of the pie
finally -PRON- could not help -PRON- cut to a studio apartment where michael be sprawl on a black bean bag chair as -PRON- hear the distinct crackle of an old school vinyl record player and the distinct voice of the late harry chapin
-PRON- take off to find the footlight and -PRON- take off to find the sky
and here -PRON- be act happy inside -PRON- handsome home
and -PRON- -PRON- be fly in -PRON- taxi take tip and get stone
-PRON- go fly so high when -PRON- be s t o n e d
really really really expensive would not eat here if -PRON- be the one who be go to pay
food be good but come in super small serving
die alte wache ist
-PRON- be unteren
teil sehr gemütlich durch den offenen kamin
die speisekarte
vielseitig und eine
der lokale die palatschinken anbietenimmer ein klasse dessert
die gerichte sehr schmackhaft aber nicht alle selbst produziert
soßen eher fertigsaucen
da fehlt die eigene note
-PRON- receive -PRON- ba some time ago and be poise and ready to go to grad school to pursue a career in academia either literature or creative writing but then life happen and fast forward seven year
and -PRON- have a ton of work experience and travel abroad but be still miss something in professional life
so -PRON- start hunt for job and keep run into the same problem all of -PRON- require an mba
nowadays an mba be what a ba be 10 20 year ago
-PRON- be kind of the standard now
to even be consider -PRON- have to have this degree so then -PRON- set out about find a place that would not only give -PRON- class but give -PRON- the intangible that set exceptional people apart from the rest
so -PRON- look at wake forest and -PRON- look at uncc and -PRON- look at chapel hill and find the same trend -PRON- show -PRON- all the bell and whistle of -PRON- program the update technology the fact and figure about success rate the name drop -PRON- could do but none of those program really have substance
-PRON- would take some class learn enough to get good grade and -PRON- be do
when -PRON- visit queens not only do dean shiffler present the school in a positive light which be expect one of the current student do
unsolicited
-PRON- be walk around the ground strike up a conversation -PRON- be in the program -PRON- be interested in and -PRON- give -PRON- the run down
-PRON- be an honest assessment and that mean more to -PRON- than anything else
-PRON- be in -PRON- second year now in the pmba program and -PRON- will tell -PRON- this -PRON- will never regret this decision
-PRON- still have a way to go but -PRON- have learn more than just finance and stock and bond and amortization and cost\/benefit analysis and all the other information -PRON- will learn in an mba program
-PRON- have learn about -PRON-
-PRON- have discover that -PRON- vision for -PRON- professional path be
almost non existent and -PRON- be at a point in -PRON- life where -PRON- be go nowhere fast
-PRON- truly invest in -PRON- here
-PRON- be a small school which be just what -PRON- need
-PRON- be competitive but rewarding
student really build a community here
-PRON- be not just a number professor remember -PRON- by name or at least face
-PRON- be accessible -PRON- listen and most importantly -PRON- approach -PRON- job as a person first and a dr second
-PRON- would be willing to speak to anyone about the pmba program at queens -PRON- have learn some invaluable lesson already as a result
aside from the beautiful campus -PRON- get a sense of belong here
southern charm at -PRON- be good
-PRON- be really proud to be a graduate royal and -PRON- should definitely consider queens
service be decent -PRON- be promise a lake view room for the price -PRON- pay and instead get a wonderful view of the parking lot
the room be disgusting
rust on the shower no extra toilet paper -PRON- do not even bother clean the coffee machine
there be mold on a previously use coffee packet use qtip inside -PRON- ice bucket curtain have moth hole
honestly -PRON- have be to motel 6 's with clean room
this be disgusting
if -PRON- could give no star -PRON- would
-PRON- order a margarita pizza and wait two hour for delivery and still do not receive the pizza
when -PRON- call to find out what happen to the pizza the lady over the phone say that the delivery guy have already come by and knock on the door and that -PRON- say -PRON- phone number that -PRON- give -PRON- do not work
-PRON- ask -PRON- why -PRON- do not try ring the doorbell and -PRON- say -PRON- knock and that knock should have be good enough
when -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- have receive no miss call and ask -PRON- when -PRON- could try to re deliver the pizza -PRON- say -PRON- would have to wait
another couple hour because the driver have already come out once and that -PRON- be go to be put at the end of the line
when -PRON- ask to speak to the manager -PRON- of course say that the manager have already go home for the day
this woman make no effort to make this right
-PRON- tell -PRON- that wait another two hour be ridiculous because -PRON- still have not even receive -PRON- pizza
-PRON- cancel -PRON- order and decide to never use angelina 's pizza again
what be to boot be that -PRON- get charge over the phone for a pizza that -PRON- never even receive
bad service ever
go for new year 's last night with -PRON- hubby
rachel -PRON- server be bubbly enthusiastic genuine and engaging
excellent service the prime rib buffet be delish as well
there be some amazing violin player to accompany the duel piano
-PRON- give -PRON- 5 star because service be on the ball from host to busser and the food be quality
the musical experience be a little pedestrian at time but that be to be expect when -PRON- be play to a large varied group and try to make everyone happy
overall a nice evening out for -PRON-
the food be good but this be the second time wen have come here and the service be horrible
-PRON- server gian carlo old gentleman bald with glass be horrible
first -PRON- never offer -PRON- any drink after the bread be bring out
-PRON- be about 10 min before -PRON- be bring water
when the appetizer come out this guy be not be careful what so ever and be hold the platter by -PRON- mother in law head where -PRON- have to lean to the side and when -PRON- do -PRON- bring the plate even closer to -PRON- ear
barely check up on -PRON- at all throughout the dinner
and all through out the dinner -PRON- never offer -PRON- drink
at least -PRON- get water
-PRON- guess
shop local
-PRON- use to meet with client at starbucks but realize -PRON- be not do -PRON- part to support -PRON- local economy
-PRON- begin meet at grouchy john 's
this place be by far the good coffee shop in las vegas
-PRON- offer unique blend and there be always a positive atmosphere when -PRON- walk in
love go there
so incredibly good
beautiful presentation
so creative every detail from the atmosphere to the very last bite
the vegan option be so incredibly good
this be absolutely -PRON- favorite restaurant in the valley
-PRON- really hope this place thrive on grand ave for many year to come
-PRON- love chef silvana salcido esparza
-PRON- love miranda phillip and the entire crew
go there
-PRON- visit this restaurant at least once a year since -PRON- move here in 2007 and -PRON- remain -PRON- very favourite in toronto
-PRON- read that right
if -PRON- have to choose one top restaurant -PRON- would be mezzetta
-PRON- love the concept
there be some 50 item on the menu and something for everyone
-PRON- be a lot of fun especially with a small group to talk and negotiate what -PRON- will order
the small plate allow -PRON- to get many taste all in one night
-PRON- be the ultimate restaurant for anyone with commitment issue
the food -PRON- be delicious
-PRON- do not think -PRON- have try one of the dish that be not pretty tasty and many be really good even the basic such as the rice
the service have always be good too -PRON- have never have a problem with slow service or the like
the value be fair if -PRON- want to stuff -PRON- silly and spend as little as possible this be not -PRON- place
but if -PRON- be look for an interesting dining experience where -PRON- will not leave hungry or with an empty wallet this be -PRON- place
the place can get a little bit crowded depend on the night and time
-PRON- would recommend a reservation
-PRON- have not be here for the music night
-PRON- think -PRON- use to be jazz
-PRON- can accommodate a large party but the ideal size be probably 4 which allow -PRON- to sample 20 of the item
a big party mean more item but remember that the size of the plate stay the same hence people may not get to try everything
-PRON- think one of the good time to come here be first date night mean the first proper date after -PRON- have meet somebody for coffee or a drink
talk about the menu item can break any remain ice and share the plate help build a bond
plus -PRON- can then go for a walk along st. clair
most highly recommend
this be another go to pizza joint in charlotte
-PRON- get two different pie deliver to -PRON- use the doordash app and -PRON- be worth every penny
-PRON- be worried about the size but the pizza but -PRON- be very fill and taste amazing
if -PRON- a cheese lover -PRON- recommend get the fresh mozzarella -PRON- will take -PRON- pizza to another level
each bite be load with topping just how pizza be suppose be
go here on a thursday evening to enjoy drink with a couple of friend
-PRON- be -PRON- first time here
so of course -PRON- want to check the entire place out to see what all -PRON- have to offer
this be very difficult to do consider every corner -PRON- turn there be another employee ask -PRON- if -PRON- be part of the party
every part of the place be reserve expect the outside bar
sorry
but -PRON- find this very annoying -PRON- come to play game an hang out but be unable to do so due to the entire place be reserve
-PRON- think -PRON- should have at least post a sign on the front door warn customer that -PRON- be book for the evening
due to this very bad first experience -PRON- will probably never go back
forget about downtown fare like le taj just go to punjab palace with -PRON- favourite bottle of wine in hand
wait a while to be seat because this place be super busy and enjoy the good indian food in town
go with a large group and order more variety try many of the dish in -PRON- extensive menu and -PRON- be in for some delightful surprise
place be not fancy but clean well keep not tacky comfortable and the staff be super friendly and efficient enough
go there many many time never disappoint
last time april 2016 with a family group of 8 and the waiter at reception be extremely helpful secure a table for -PRON- in reasonable time despite the busy line behind -PRON- and the packed room
-PRON- have try la carnita a bunch of time now and -PRON- can say that -PRON- definitely find -PRON- new favourite mexican place
-PRON- be really hard for -PRON- to say what -PRON- like the most because hem
-PRON- like everything that have
ihih
-PRON- really enjoy -PRON- margarita though nice and fresh and not too alcoholic so -PRON- can enjoy the food and not get waste and spoil -PRON- before the end of the dinner
this place be delicious
great lunch combo and sushi be fresh
-PRON- new favorite lunch spot
-PRON- go to midas for a car safety inspection as the ownership need to change on -PRON- car and the government require an inspection first
the dealership be go to charge $ 150 but midas charge only $ 89 plus tax
the service manager be really nice and accommodate
-PRON- answer email quickly and effectively
once at the store get the inspection do do not take much time and be very easy
overall nice place
-PRON- would go back for other thing
if -PRON- be plan on use this service center to get to and from the airport -PRON- be good off just pay the extra for a taxi
for $ 15 each -PRON- sit in the shuttle for nearly an hour as the driver take -PRON- time drop off every passenger at -PRON- hotel -PRON- be last
on -PRON- way back -PRON- be even bad
-PRON- be tell shuttle come about every 30 minute so -PRON- come out around 9:30 am to catch -PRON- shuttle to the airport
-PRON- see numerous other shuttle company make stop after stop but grayline shuttle be nowhere to be see
a couple graylines come and each driver tell -PRON- -PRON- be only allow to drop off not pick up
-PRON- wait for the shuttle until 11 with about a dozen other angry traveler finally -PRON- could not wait any longer risk to miss -PRON- flight
so -PRON- just take an uber to the airport which end up be only $ 10 anyway
much faster more convenient and the driver be friendly
this company be a rip off and scam to get traveler money without deliver any service
omg the food here be amazing
-PRON- have the gringo taco lol and a bomb
elote
-PRON- have not have a meal that great in a long time
-PRON- also pretty cool how container palr be tuck away from the strip
another sushi joint own by koreans
this mean that -PRON- also have a couple rib and bulgogi on -PRON- ayce menu
-PRON- enjoy come here but -PRON- be hard to make -PRON- a consistent visit because -PRON- can get quite pricey even without the ayce
-PRON- suggest come here to eat -PRON- uni sea urchin and octopus though
-PRON- be one of the most fresh sushi joint for those two that -PRON- have have
-PRON- have eat here twice now and both time have be great
good cocktail great appetizer and entree
last time -PRON- have the artic char pasta and -PRON- be delicious
the service be great and -PRON- will be back soon for sure
pretty good
the waitress be very nice and conversat with everyone
the food come pretty fast
great service
-PRON- be party for 8 include two kid on monday lunch
-PRON- server be very attentive
-PRON- never ask refill -PRON- split food for sharing
forget -PRON- name
the only thing be -PRON- selection of sushi
-PRON- be just typical fish and there be no special neta
but -PRON- guess -PRON- be okay to have business in this area
four start overall
great when -PRON- be in a good mood but beware
the owner -PRON- believe -PRON- be the owner be very pleasant until -PRON- have a question that -PRON- do not like
-PRON- smile quickly become a scowl and -PRON- be not very pleasant anymore
-PRON- be extremely rude and condescending and become pretty aggressive towards -PRON- in a matter of minute
-PRON- will be happily return to the less glamorous but good quality and far more reasonably price option a bit south down the street on roncesvalles instead of give -PRON- money to a business run by an owner who think -PRON- customer be a nuisance to scowl at
apart from that the price be hipster high but -PRON- do not mind for what -PRON- perceive to a premium service
which -PRON- be not
thank -PRON- guy for great customer service fast delivery and amazing food
-PRON- order the family feast and -PRON- be cheap
and feed -PRON- family of 5 dinner and lunch the next day
-PRON- can judge a pizza place if the pizza be good with no topping besides cheese
and this be excellent
perfect thin crispy crust
the sauce be delish
the cheesy bread be so yummy as be the marinara
the wing be great -PRON- kid devour -PRON-
chicken finger perfectly season and homemade fresh
the fry as -PRON- 5 yr old say be excellent lol and thank -PRON- for the extra hot sauce
only downside be -PRON- want more pizza so -PRON- will be order again soon
thank -PRON-
hand down good performance ever
two hour of classic rock from three decade between the 60 's and the 80 's
class act musician from mainstay rock group pour -PRON- heart out in one of the good concert -PRON- have ever see
close -PRON- eye and -PRON- would swear -PRON- be with led zeppelin playing stairway to heaven down to every note dead on
great small venue theater at the las vegas hilton where there be not a bad seat in the house
simply put just go
-PRON- pay to become a loyalty customer with cvs

plus -PRON- get ton of coupon via receipt or the coupon kiosk -PRON- can use in store
staff be friendly enough and great -PRON- as -PRON- come through the door
also if -PRON- set up for email alert -PRON- coupon come directly to -PRON- which be -PRON- convenient enough to where -PRON- do not have to go directly to the store
also by download the app -PRON- will see what coupon be available to -PRON-
-PRON- can also order print or request refill online
a party of about 100 people attend at this location to celebrate and on the morning of the second day graduation day at that about half of -PRON- come down with wicked food poisoning
the day to follow would also prove this to be contagious
the culprit be most likely the bad quality of the beef or the spinach
depend on how much -PRON- eat of the contaminate food determine when -PRON- get sick whether -PRON- be up at 4 a.m. puke or stay up all night
-PRON- be a time bomb and an utter disaster
the real kicker be that graduation be suppose to be one of the happy day and this make -PRON- one of the more miserable one
fortunately most of -PRON- make -PRON- through the ceremony but there be a few close call and a lot of baggie at hand
-PRON- can not even imagine what this would do to ruin a honeymoon in the middle of the ocean on a flight to jamaica
hors d'oeuvres be too few small cold and disappear fast regardless
portion be small but that be to be expect of fancy dining
location decor and set be over all nice
service and employee be good too except for the one that mess -PRON- all up with a virus or a contaminate serve station or both
the have very limited bathroom space
could probably do with some hide pest control\/trap to keep -PRON- from get into the food
the lighting be also insufficient once the sun go down
beware if -PRON- decide to have a large party here for a happy event or -PRON- may have a lot of unhappy guest demand retribution afterwards
yes there be ton of old folk there
but so what
-PRON- be the good omelet -PRON- have have in quite a while
-PRON- have the asparagus pancetta and swiss omelet and hubby have the avocado and bacon omelet
-PRON- be good but both be delicious
hash brown nice and brown and the pancake be much good than ihops but not to die for
will definitely be back
oh and -PRON- server be excellent
great ambience great poutine
could not have ask for more
nice find in a fun area
great for quick cheap greasy and delicious take out love -PRON- chicken souvlaki and fry
perpetually busy for good reason
-PRON- have to start by say the portion be tiny
-PRON- 4 year old hammer down the fish n chip in under 5 min not bc -PRON- be delicious but because -PRON- be literally 3 strip the size of -PRON- thumb
for $ 12 -PRON- be a horrible buy
the lobster sandwich be also for the post bariatric surgery patient with a belly the size of a orange
the lobster chunk be good but for $ 17 -PRON- would expect more than 3 bite fold in 1 slice of regular bread
pros convenient location
cons size portions
size portions
cost cost do not recommend
for $ 4 more might as well eat a full planet hollywood buffet
small portion and not good tasting food
in the word of david sedaris -PRON- be so bad and there be so little of -PRON-
-PRON- order the reuben panini and -PRON- be $ 8.87 after tax
-PRON- be not really a panini just a half heartedly press sandwich
-PRON- come with a pickle and chip
the sandwich be small to average sized and contain pastrami sauerkraut cheese and a very unpleasant tasting dressing
the pickle be nice and crisp but the chip be stale kettle style but without the crunch -PRON- be suppose to have
drive thru service be neither friendly nor unpleasant just indifferent
this should be a $ 5 sandwich not a $ 9 sandwich
do -PRON- a favor if -PRON- be in the area and go to jason 's deli paradise bakery or hillside spot instead
-PRON- first go to this place earlier in the year when -PRON- open and -PRON- love -PRON-
-PRON- typically always get the steak salad but have try various other appetizers\/entrees\/dessert
and -PRON- have all be so tasty
-PRON- absolutely love the decor in this restaurant as well as -PRON- outdoor space
so much so that when -PRON- fiance and -PRON- be stress out from try to plan -PRON- wedding -PRON- decide to have the restaurant host -PRON- reception
-PRON- work with andy and create a wonderful menu and experience for -PRON- wedding guest
-PRON- be very patient and understanding and just want to make sure -PRON- be happy
on the day of the reception -PRON- be there for the majority of the time and make sure everything go smoothly
-PRON- really could not have have a good experience with andy and -PRON- staff
although -PRON- be nervous at first since -PRON- be not a traditional wedding reception spot -PRON- be pleasantly surprised and elated at the professionalism of everyone involve
since -PRON- be still relatively new -PRON- would say about 99 of -PRON- guest have never be there and most of -PRON- rave to -PRON- about how good the food be so -PRON- hope that -PRON- return on -PRON- own and continue keep this place in business
the cost for the reception be very reasonable and not inflate by the wedding industry
if -PRON- can handle a wedding reception -PRON- would definitely recommend this restaurant for any private event
-PRON- opt for this place becauae of the high rating on yelp and -PRON- get -PRON- expectation maybe too much high
while the ingredient and all be fresh and tasty enough -PRON- would say -PRON- be more for the value for money place give the portion and the quality serve
pretty average restaurant
-PRON- smell like an old person dinner club very ketchupy and fry foody
waitstaff be very nice and personable
the roasted vegetable and hummus wrap be amazing
-PRON- would not go downtown and deal with parking just for the sandwich but if -PRON- be stay at the hotel or -PRON- live in the neighborhood -PRON- would head over there occasionally just for the sandwich
decent chinese food for mississauga standard
food come pretty fast and the service be standard
but the atmosphere suck the seat be pretty tight and the floorplan be poorly arrange -PRON- try to fit in more table and chair than the space allow
also there be empty cardboard box and dirty dish bin all over the place
if -PRON- just care about the food and not the overall presentation of the place then go for -PRON-
this place be great
the kid area be especially cool for -PRON- because of -PRON- 4 and 2 y\/o boy
thank -PRON-
thank -PRON-
thank -PRON- for create an area -PRON- can burn calorie while the rest of -PRON- eat
the pastrami sandwich be incredible
must try
see this place drive by stop and can not get enough
just move here from tucson where food like this be on every corner
-PRON- have be search for something to match up since november and finally here -PRON- be
service be great salsa bar be yummy and the food be delicious and authentic
-PRON- be only lack 1 star because -PRON- wish that -PRON- be open later and especially on sunday
also -PRON- a bit pricey from what -PRON- be use too but as -PRON- say this kind of food be on every corner in tucson at .75 cent a taco
-PRON- be still hooked and will recommend to everyone -PRON- can
very good food at affordable price and -PRON- even deliver
-PRON- cheese quesadilla and salsa be amazing
try for the first time yesterday and will definitely be back
girl at the front desk be very friendly and patient
-PRON- have -PRON- set to go for a smog check in no time
-PRON- would come back here again
other note
interior waiting room be cool and very clean
-PRON- offer free coffee which be a huge plus
great kung pao chicken
nice cheap $ 6.50 chinese lunch special but the test of the menu be great too
-PRON- sushi be okay quite healthy like much of what -PRON- serve but kind of bland
difficult to understand the server
but -PRON- be friendly enough
food be great
-PRON- husband and -PRON- order a salad and a shrimp asparagus fettuccini entree
-PRON- be just enough for the two of -PRON-
the waitress be very friendly and helpful
even though -PRON- be early for dinner and the restaurant be empty -PRON- take a while to be serve
the bread be delicious
the good ever
-PRON- sit next to the window that overlook the fish tank
-PRON- be a very pleasant dinner
-PRON- want to go to a sushi place close to home
so -PRON- decide to stop by here
from the outside -PRON- can look like nothing special but this place be great
the service be wonderful and the sushi be fresh
-PRON- really enjoy watch the chef make the sushi from the monitor on the wall
definitely want to try the bulgogi next time -PRON- go
meet up with some friend here for brunch
order chicken and waffle cinnamon crunch french toast platter corn beef and hash steak and egg and pot of bread
-PRON- friend get -PRON- chicken and waffle and the chicken be undercook
the staff be nice enough to change -PRON- quickly
-PRON- order the cinnamon crunch french toast -PRON- be pretty good nothing special really
-PRON- love the warm cinnamon syrup -PRON- serve
the pot of bread be basically cinnamon bun in a cup
-PRON- get hard quickly
so -PRON- kinda do not like -PRON-
banger sausage and hash brown be so good
-PRON- usually love -PRON- hash brown well do crunchy and -PRON- will season
and of course steak and egg be on point
oh dear where to start
the bouncer be actually very nice
everyone say to have a good night another one near the coat check make sure i know there be a weird little step down thingy and help -PRON- clean -PRON- jacket for when some dude totally fall on -PRON- with -PRON- drink lol
less than 2 min i be in there
and i have a drink on -PRON-
anyway -the music be super scatter like really weird house one minute then the i like to move -PRON- song then drake crowd be super young with no one really dress up
i see guy with hoodie on
bad of all the dancefloor be so humid and smell like vomit everywhere -PRON- do not even dare go down the step into that nastiness
-PRON- stay right by the door for about 15 min before decide -PRON- could not do -PRON- anymore
if -PRON- 18\/19 and just wanna do -PRON- thang then come here
if -PRON- 21 plus and have be go out for awhile -PRON- will not like -PRON- here
-PRON- a diy freeze yogurt place with load of innovative flavor and great topping
-PRON- always opt for the not so exciting original tart which be so so good with fresh strawberry and chocolate
the reason yogurtland deserve a 5 be that -PRON- totally do not rip -PRON- off for yogurt
-PRON- frozen yogurt for goodness sake- no reason to charge some ridiculous amount
plus if -PRON- want one strawberry on -PRON- yogurt or something equally as crazy
-PRON- can put whatev -PRON- want on -PRON- yogurt
what be not to love
mixed review here but so be the member of -PRON- family
good location yet -PRON- only have to wait about 15 minute to be seat outside on a beautiful day
wait on right away for drink and -PRON- be already to order
food come out fast
wife and son have the motley que pull pork
teenager think -PRON- be great but -PRON- wife think for all -PRON- talk about bold flavor -PRON- may have be a little bland
daughter have a cheeseburger that be very big and cook perfectly
all of -PRON- get fry 4 way and be pleased
-PRON- 16 year old get the double barrel bbq wings and do not find -PRON- tasty and do not have enough heat
-PRON- have the italian deli salad and -PRON- rank up there on one of the good -PRON- have have
the bowl be make of a thick piece of smoke provolone wrap in prosciutto
plenty of different type of olive cheese and dry sausage on the side
-PRON- be not that hungry to start but eat every last bite of a large salad
wish -PRON- go there when -PRON- be hungry
so one teenager do not care for -PRON- wife and daughter think -PRON- be ok and the other teen
and -PRON- have a great meal
in vegas -PRON- think -PRON- be a good value
this place seem to be a valley staple so -PRON- have to try -PRON- despite some poor review
-PRON- experience be pretty good
order two sandwich combo at $ 9.89 each
usually do not comment on beverage but the rare presence of big red in the soda machine be one -PRON- take advantage of right off the bat
move on to the side dish the macaroni and cheese be just average a bit gummy but the potato salad have large chunk of potato and a nice relishy taste
ok now onto the main course
the chop chicken be just that 95 white meat chop onto a bun
so in this case the bbq sauce better be good or else -PRON- will be one dry sandwich and luckily this sauce be tasty kind of a thick red vinegar style but still a good taste and -PRON- get soak up fast
the brisket be another huge sandwich almost need a knife and fork as meat spill everywhere a good thing
this be shred or chop style brisket and -PRON- even find a few burn end bury amongst the meat
hardly any fat and once again and that sauce make an appearance and complete the brisket very nicely
place be pretty empty at 6:30pm on a weekday just the way -PRON- like -PRON-
wow
-PRON- be impressed
-PRON- break -PRON- ipad 2 screen yesterday morning and by the afternoon have -PRON- completely fix by charlotte iphone repair
alex come to -PRON- office and fix -PRON- while -PRON- watch
-PRON- be happy because -PRON- have sensitive datum on -PRON- ipad
and -PRON- do not want to just leave -PRON- somewhere
-PRON- be also happy because -PRON- get same day service to get -PRON- fix because -PRON- be addict to -PRON- ipad and do not want to do without -PRON- for even a day
most place will not even call -PRON- back same day must less get the service do same day
amazing food
the pastor be bomb
love the decor food and staff
super friendly
awesome all around
the purée taste like vomit how old be that broccoli rabe dude
the luke warm meat feel like try to cut through a dead fish with a butter knife
do not help that the waitress be a wet blanket
big waste of money in 2013
do not even bother
-PRON- wife and -PRON- stop in here after a movie
the burger be overprice consider -PRON- do not come with fry but -PRON- be good
-PRON- be like a cafeteria experience where -PRON- order food at the counter then find a seat
very chaotic for a friday night in downtown summerlin if -PRON- be a first time visitor and not familiar with the menu
decent beer selection but again over price
pay $ 8.11 for a pint of ipa not even a special run
oh and -PRON- have to get up and get -PRON- -PRON-
what be the sense of go out to eat here then
-PRON- typically love there service quality
but today i bring a group of 4 in for a birthday celebration an a little girl time an let just start off by say -PRON- be rob of -PRON- girl time due to the fact that i make appointment even mention -PRON- would wait till -PRON- could all sit together an -PRON- nail tech response be

-PRON- get mad because -PRON- hear -PRON- talk about -PRON- tab
the only reason -PRON- talk about -PRON- be because -PRON- have 2 creepy guy follow -PRON- from 3 different bar try to order drink on -PRON- tab
so -PRON- want to make sure -PRON- drink be not on -PRON- tab
needless to say this girl blow up on -PRON- for no reason get mad because -PRON- only order 3 drink -PRON- be 1:30 in the morning by the way
so
-PRON- want to make sure -PRON- tab be right
-PRON- work in a high pace bar in north scottsdale call the village tavern and if -PRON- act like that and treat a guest in this manner -PRON- would have be fire
-PRON- feel so disrespect in this place -PRON- will never go back nor in courage other to go there do not come to this place the bartender aweful
good place for a satisfy tasty meal

to anybody live in the neighborhood -PRON- will understand -PRON- food option be limit to certain fast food chain and that can get old
-PRON- be not usually a bar person since -PRON- do not drink
but -PRON- give this place a try with -PRON- wife and

-PRON- recommend most -PRON- burger menu although -PRON- have not be disappoint with other option yet

otherwise enjoy
be hear good thing be about this little bar and make sure on -PRON- recent trip to vegas -PRON- give -PRON- a shot
try to start the death by chocolate martini and be impressed by far at the great combo of alcohol and chocolate mix together
the place be not huge by bar standard 's but -PRON- be unique in -PRON- be own and a really a good spot to check out if -PRON- a chocolate lover with a little twist to -PRON-
-PRON- can not honestly wait to return to this place and try another drink -PRON- be that good
easy 4 star 's all day long check -PRON- out and try something different from -PRON- average drink
-PRON- be not impressed by the long wait to see a doctor
unless -PRON- be die -PRON- will be expect to wait at least 4 hour or more
-PRON- have a nurse to check -PRON- first and then -PRON- be direct to wait in the reception area
after 2 hour -PRON- get to sit inside the room to wait for a doctor
2 more hour go by the doctor finally come
-PRON- really need to take urgent out of -PRON- name
the only plus be that -PRON- do friendly staff
food 3.5\/5
service 2\/5
location
4\/5
there be really not much more -PRON- can ask for $ 2.50 drink on a rooftop patio on a friday night
yes the place may be pack and
yes the service may be crappy but
c'mon
-PRON- think people be cultivate some lofty expectation for this place
-PRON- actually really enjoy -PRON- appetizer like -PRON- meatball and anjohitos grant -PRON- take about half an hour for a server to show up and another half an hour for the food to make -PRON- appearance
-PRON- friend and -PRON- love -PRON- and despite -PRON- flaw -PRON- still come here all the time for after work drink
order food twice here -PRON- really good
-PRON- mean -PRON- no pf chang but seriously good

the chicken lo mein be really good
-PRON- honestly just mix the two together and omg so bomb haha

but anyway yeah -PRON- recommend either of those dish -PRON- girlfriend get the orange chicken and say -PRON- be alright
-PRON- eat -PRON- left over the next day be pretty good in -PRON- opinion
so if -PRON- sit there read these review and thinking can -PRON- be trust

the answer yes
-PRON- always have a positive interaction with these folk
the food be par for the expectation of the chain and -PRON- be consistent
the service be always great
base on that there be no reason not to score a 5
-PRON- be not a custom pizza shop
-PRON- be pizza hut
-PRON- taste like pizza hut be suppose to taste
the service be above par so there ya go
the one star review here be so off the mark
-PRON- have be work with american interiors for 6 year

minus
the music can be really loud

-PRON- find this on yahoo answer 100 decibel equivalent to a chain saw pneumatic drill print plant jackhammer speed express train some car horn at five meter farm tractor rivet machine some noisy subway about 20 foot
so yeah the other reviewer be not exaggerate when -PRON- say -PRON- be loud in there
the lighting be super bright fluorescent bulb style
these 2 thing combine to make this not the place for a relaxing dinner after a long day at work
-PRON- be more of an adventure so find something -PRON- have not try yet shout out -PRON- order and enjoy that michelada
have be here several time and always have a good experience bit this past saturday be awful

when the appetizer finally arrive -PRON- be good but dinner be disappointing
dry burger steak cook wrong

-PRON- do take off the burger and steak but still leave a bad taste for this place
-PRON- have have bad experience in the past with furniture store and -PRON- lack of customer service
needless to say -PRON- have not be a fan of the furniture buying process until -PRON- find this place
-PRON- buy a recliner from -PRON- for -PRON- clinic and a bed frame for -PRON- home on two separate occasion and both time -PRON- customer service be phenomenal
-PRON- also deliver for -PRON- and help -PRON- with set up
-PRON- feel like -PRON- can trust the people over there too
-PRON- work with whitney and sean and highly recommend -PRON-

thank
after read review on this place -PRON- seem like the only thing wrong with the store be the customer -PRON-
-PRON- do not think much of -PRON- and decide to go base on the other review
at first glance the store be wonderful the building -PRON- be beautiful and the selection be pretty varied which be fantastic
most of the produce look great some not so much and there be tasting in multiple place
however -PRON- can see the point about the people ruin the experience
little thing here and there such as be glare at when taste the cheese
-PRON- try one of each and buy -PRON- favorite one
have -PRON- cart push aside unceremoniously by a customer without a word
the deli woman and -PRON- general and blatant unhappiness which this extend to basically all of the employee except the one cashier who check -PRON- out
-PRON- be quite friendly
and lastly the customer -PRON- all look like -PRON- common ancestor be
grumpy the dwarf from snow white
so frankly if -PRON- want to go there
-PRON- be great for prepared food and general shopping the price be about what -PRON- would figure for a city except the meat
which be way too expensive 4 8 oz flank steak for over $ 44
craziness
-PRON- get 2 star for -PRON- be selection but definitely 3 knock off for the atmosphere
-PRON- love the hotel -PRON-
the entire staff be great
-PRON- would give urban restaurant a 2 or 3 star because the server be not helpful at all when -PRON- come to the food
then the breakfast food be unique but not so much in a good way
-PRON- would have rather eat at the starbucks than urban if -PRON- be look for any type of tradition breakfast sandwhich
plus urban be rather pricey and -PRON- could have save 25 dollar eat at starbucks
go there with some friend for a bday party
sat at the bar for a few min and no one come to see what -PRON- want so -PRON- sit at the table
wait 15 min before -PRON- server come to get -PRON- drink order
then -PRON- be another 10 15 min before -PRON- receive the drink
-PRON- be over an hour since -PRON- sit down and -PRON- have to ask -PRON- waitress if -PRON- could order food
order a few appetizer and the club sandwich
the fry be cold and soggy like -PRON- be sit for quite a while
-PRON- friend order a well do burger specifically say to burn -PRON- and -PRON- come out medium
another friend order the chinese chicken salad and -PRON- do not have any dressing on -PRON-
-PRON- order 3 of the goblet and could not taste the alcohol
pretty sure -PRON- be just fruit punch or
whatev sugary beverage -PRON- keep on hand with no alcohol whatsoever
the lady bathroom be a whole other story
there be no toilet seat cover in any of the stall no paper towel and very little toilet paper
-PRON- be horrible
-PRON- be like a public park restroom
2 out of the 3 stall be unuseable due to clog toilet
the only one that be not be the handicapped stall
the kicker be there be a waitress in the bathroom
and -PRON- do not even tell management that the restroom need to be attend to
will never go here again and will not recommend this place to friend
wonder if the paris hotel location be any good
cheap and fast dry cleaning
laundered shirt be less than $ 2 each
-PRON- take care of some stain -PRON- have be try to get rid of for a while
watch the one way street out front
small hole in the wall italian spot
-PRON- roomate\/sister who by all account know how to pick delicious place to eat take -PRON- here to pick up some family grub
-PRON- order alfredo and lasagna enough to feed a family of 10 when -PRON- be actually only a family of 6
two of which be little people
-PRON- appreciate that those take -PRON- order attempt to save -PRON- money by figure out if a party tray be more doable but sadly -PRON- be not available
-PRON- be seriously starve as -PRON- be type this
so -PRON- be not help
-PRON- take about 15 minute for the food to be ready and when -PRON- take -PRON- home -PRON- be still well and hot
that first bite -PRON- tell -PRON- be utterly fantastic
the way the cheese from the lasagna just melt on -PRON- tongue and the alfredo cream just bomb -PRON- taste bud
great decision be make
definitely -PRON- go to italian spot now

-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- could do -PRON- online but when -PRON- go online -PRON- do not give -PRON- an option to buy a new card only to reload a card which apparently -PRON- do not even use anymore and -PRON- do not let -PRON- buy customizable amount
-PRON- want to spend over $ 100 which the high domination -PRON- offer

-PRON- ask again 30 minute later and -PRON- get mad walk to front desk as -PRON- stand in hallway -PRON- finally bring towel and would not look -PRON- in eye
-PRON- think -PRON- want in -PRON- room just say sketchy clean husband wife team
-PRON- personally do not recommend this hotel
-PRON- only give one star for the sweet front desk clerk otherwise -PRON- would be zero star

-PRON- could not produce a drinkable diet coke

3
at first glance -PRON- may think -PRON- be a little pricey but nay

this be not some foo foo postage stamp portion bullshit for $ 16
-PRON- get a lot of good food
-PRON- mom and -PRON- order -PRON- regular salad which come with pecan and orange slice

dessert be a delicious sampler platter of -PRON- homemade cake chocolate cake banana creme red velvet and carrot

-PRON- be go to die of delicious food overload and -PRON- will have be worth -PRON-
-PRON- just move to the area and have high hope for this place
-PRON- order carne adada taco and cheese enchilada
the taco be ok but there be nothing special about -PRON- and definitely not worth the price
the enchilada be the real disappointment
the cheese be barely melt and the sauce taste store buy
-PRON- be sad to say that -PRON- have have good enchilada from the frozen food aisle
the culture be amazing and -PRON- absolutely love the training concept
-PRON- have make two trip from los angeles to complete the zuu and ankorr level 1 course and -PRON- be already look forward to level 2 class

by the way the wait staff be rad and efficient
charles be great -PRON- need a water heater replace
-PRON- give -PRON- a quick estimate over the phone which be very reasonable and politely say to call back if -PRON- want to use -PRON-
-PRON- appreciate the price -PRON- quote and really appreciate the lack of a hard sale that -PRON- get from a lot of other people
so -PRON- go with -PRON- immediately
-PRON- show up within the 30 minute window -PRON- promise
-PRON- take hit time to do -PRON- right and -PRON- even explain a lot of stuff to -PRON- as -PRON- watch -PRON- work
-PRON- be a wannabe do -PRON- yourselfer who be not up to this task so this be nice get some pro tip
oh and -PRON- be able to use a tube from -PRON- old heater that be new and still in perfect condition so -PRON- take off $ 25 from the original quote
-PRON- will use -PRON- again and recommend -PRON- to friend and family
one downside
if -PRON- want to pay with a credit card -PRON- will have to pay a 2.5 premium so give -PRON- a check and save -PRON- a few buck
love -PRON- some fratello
i love any kind of italian yumminess
however anything with the fratello sauce be a plus in -PRON- lovely opinion
-PRON- most recent obsession the chicken rollatini

can i bathe in this sauce
kid
well not really
-PRON- be that good
pro yummy food
good service

con small bar
small dining area
-PRON- do not take reservation
overall i think fratello know how to make some heavenly dinner
i think that -PRON- could update -PRON- dining room -PRON- seem a little outdated to -PRON- but if -PRON- be go just for the food then by all mean have at -PRON-
do not let a little outdated decor stop -PRON- in -PRON- track
-PRON- come here to relax and have a drink with friend mainly because -PRON- be really close to -PRON- house
the atmosphere be really great -PRON- be casual -PRON- be down to earth and -PRON- definitely feel like -PRON- be among friend
and in the summer -PRON- have a nice patio in the back
sometimes though -PRON- find the music be a little loud at night
and -PRON- be hard to talk and hear people
the food be definitely pub food and -PRON- get the job do
come here on a saturday night around 8 p.m. without reservation the hostess say -PRON- would be about 40 minute wait luckily -PRON- end up be only about 20 minute for a table for two
-PRON- be during -PRON- mussel promotion $ 11 for a lb of mussel and fry which be a great deal
-PRON- get the rosarda rosé beer which be a good price and fruity and also try a hawaiian beer which be recommend which be light
so drink be good
the mussel however be really underwhelming or maybe because -PRON- be the special
get the provencale which -PRON- be tell be creamy and describe with herbs -PRON- come as clear plain chicken broth with a few raw diced tomato and chunk of raw garlic that be -PRON-
also get the a la snob flavour with lobster creme -PRON- arrive with barely any bland sauce again with the chunk of raw vegetable throw in
-PRON- burger be not bad a standard burger the bbq sauce -PRON- come with be good all this take 45 minute to arrive to the table
the waitress do apologize for the long wait time and give -PRON- some complimentary bread for -PRON-
-PRON- pay with a gift card the waitress take -PRON- to the back and try to deduct from -PRON- bill but do not work -PRON- be an old bon appetite card
the waitress however do not bring back the $ 25 gift card still full with credit -PRON- do not realize this until -PRON- get home
-PRON- contact the restaurant and -PRON- say -PRON- would mail -PRON- back the card -PRON- receive credit back for only bier markt don mills which -PRON- be not really pleased about since -PRON- do not really want to go back and -PRON- only valid for food not even drink
so -PRON- kind of feel like -PRON- take $ 25 from -PRON-
do not waste -PRON- time or money on the food
-PRON- may as well buy -PRON- from walmart in the frozen section
-PRON- waiter be not very attentive and make a couple mistake with -PRON- order
one of -PRON- be the shrimp cocktail
-PRON- change -PRON- mind on but -PRON- still bring to the table
-PRON- wish -PRON- would have send -PRON- back
for $ 13 -PRON- get the small cocktail shrimp -PRON- can find at walmart
yes again with walmart
that be the good and true comparison
next time -PRON- will just buy a slice of pizza at the food court
very disappointed
lunch hour ground zero tatum and cactus
pretty much whatev -PRON- want be available within 3 minute of the epicenter of this seismic fault line of culinary delight
this be a battleground that actually topple a culvers
-PRON- do not think that be possible -PRON- be like see the statue of liberty wash up on the shore in planet of the apes
whoa be that what -PRON- think -PRON- be
in other word game on and -PRON- pie have game
simple concept walk in and order one of -PRON- specialty pizza or have -PRON- put together a masterpiece that only -PRON- come up with
-PRON- have the spicy butcher and -PRON- be a terrific pizza
serve fast and right out of the oven make for a tasty lunch
-PRON- overindulge a bit and in addition to scarf the entire pizza in one sitting
-PRON- think -PRON- be big enough to share or take half home -PRON- also devour one of -PRON- monster chocolate chip cookie that -PRON- shamelessly and without a hint of remorse have at the counter for weak willed belt expand lost soul like -PRON-
-PRON- sit there and literally count the calorie somewhere in the y2 k range why indeed
-PRON- always try to cleanse -PRON- palate with a morsel of chocolate after lunch
but this take -PRON- to a new level
-PRON- have a month worth of cleanse in one sitting and do not think -PRON- will not want more chocolate tomorrow
solid four star and
-PRON- be go back again this week
like the vibe and the service be friendly and helpful give -PRON- a shot if -PRON- enjoy great pizza
service be great
ambiance be incredible
too bad the food be horrible
-PRON- have the seafood ensemble
-PRON- include maine scallop australian sea bass hawaiian blue shrimp
the seabass shrimp be delicious but the scallop be so overcook -PRON- be chewy
-PRON- boyfriend have the kobe burger -PRON- be so salty that -PRON- could not even finish -PRON-
although -PRON- be nice enough to offer to replace -PRON- food -PRON- appetite be ruin
-PRON- leave there unsatisfied
-PRON- wish -PRON- food be good because -PRON- be truly nice
sorry to say that -PRON- will not be back
really wonderful dinner here with canada
server be always attentive basically drop everything to pull out -PRON- chair each time -PRON- get up
the food be beautiful
-PRON- order the 5 course vegetarian tasting menu and canada order the 5 course regular tasting menu -PRON- substitute the john dory for lobster
-PRON- also be so sweet say happy birthday to -PRON- which be a nice touch
-PRON- only complaint be that a few of -PRON- dish be very salty a bit heavy on the cream
-PRON- know -PRON- be french so -PRON- should have be prepare for this but -PRON- somewhat take away from the natural flavor of the food
let the food be the star
also none of the dish really wow -PRON- and none of the dish do -PRON- wipe -PRON- plate clean which -PRON- do think say something
canada 's american wagu be yummy but honestly a bit dry for the way -PRON- be cook medium rare
so how could -PRON- be dry
and -PRON- lobster be drench in a sauce that again take away from the natural flavor of the food
really too bad bc
otherwise -PRON- enjoy -PRON- meal and enjoy the overall atmosphere of the restaurant
-PRON- think -PRON- would recommend but -PRON- may not return
go there today and -PRON- be not there anymore
-PRON- be now wrap and roll
and -PRON- do not look invite
-PRON- love this place
-PRON- have lunch on the patio awesome patio and have the peppercorn burger
f&ck
yeah
frendly staff very professional great service
-PRON- will recommend -PRON- to all -PRON- friend and family for -PRON- pet need
after be here a few week -PRON- have a few bitch
the main problem be the air force base be very very close
-PRON- be luke air force base
the fighter jet be take off over the resort constantly
-PRON- start at 7:00 am and continue until well after 9:00 pm
and -PRON- mean this be every day
-PRON- be so loud when -PRON- be outside that -PRON- can not hear anything else or let alone talk to someone
-PRON- other bitch be the garbage service there be only 2 day a week for garbage pickup and that be -PRON-
there be no dumpster or can to take -PRON- garbage to anywhere in the park and -PRON- let -PRON- know that
plus -PRON- can not have any bag outside period
so -PRON- must take -PRON- in -PRON- car and find a dumpster somewhere else or leave -PRON- in the trunk for day until the next pickup
other than that the park be nice
have be a fan to this raman house
-PRON- be now at anew location at the back ow 24 wesllesly st west
the entrance of the restaurant be more trendy
the interior design of the raman house be quite upscale
the size of the restaurant seem small but -PRON- have a new corner section for buying take out like bento box drink and rice ball etc
-PRON- order a deep fry chicken
still delicious and crispy as -PRON- have always be
-PRON- will give -PRON- a full score of 5\/5
also order a new item on the menu -PRON- be the raman in fish pork bone and soy sauce soup
the soup taste rich
when the raman come -PRON- do have a layer of sparkle oil on top of the soup
-PRON- be like the noodle in the northern part of japan
the soup taste rich but a bit salty to -PRON- taste
the noodle be the thick one and the chashu be not bad
-PRON- will give -PRON- a score of 4\/5
will definitely come back for the carbon with garlic soup base raman next time
-PRON- have be -PRON- all time favourite
-PRON- stop in here several year ago freak out and have not be back
there be puppy in what look like reptile cage and some in -PRON- believe dog cage
some guy come in with a crate of what look like poodle puppy ?for
sale
and the lady there have clean a cage out
-PRON- guess for these new one
-PRON- do not know
some little kid be there run around handle the new arrival and be a bit
well just be kid
but -PRON- make -PRON- uncomfortable
the place be loud and there be a bunch of critter
from what -PRON- could see the cage be clean and the people nice
-PRON- think -PRON- be a stressful atmosphere
-PRON- do not like see the puppy in those little cages\/crowded room and that be why -PRON- mark -PRON- down
-PRON- stay at main street station while at las vegas bikefest this past weekend
have a great time
the hotel have a cool vibe and look like a turn of the century train station
the room where much nice than expect especially for the price which be really reasonable
-PRON- have dinner at the 777 restaurant one night
the micro brew here be excellent and the food be good and reasonably price
-PRON- also eat at the buffet for breakfast and -PRON- be dynamite
the good think though about this place be $ 1.75 micro brew at the bar
in this town where $ 6 bud light be the norm -PRON- be floored to get a quality beer for under two buck
that alone will keep -PRON- come back to this place
if -PRON- want a nice hotel at a really low price this be the place
love -PRON-
great location in downtown off fremont street but now that the apparatus be in for the zip lining
-PRON- block the view of the activity
the restaurant be quite nice and the service be very good
-PRON- like hear the live music from the lounge the volume be just right and not too loud to disrupt dinner conversation
reason for only three star be the veal chop that turn out to be more than 50 fat
very little meat on that chop and a real disappointment
the au gratin potato and corn soufflé side be delicious plenty for two people to share
the asparagus spear be really large and pretty much tasteless
-PRON- would definitely come back to oscars again
but -PRON- would stick with a good steak
this place be soooo good
do not let the outside fool -PRON-
-PRON- be not what -PRON- would expect on the outside but the inside be just what -PRON- would expect a bbq place to look like
today be -PRON- first time try -PRON- and the girl at the counter be very nice and offer -PRON- sample of the brisket
the meat be so good and tender
-PRON- be so happy -PRON- find this place down here in this area!.
go on date night and be amazed
fantastic food great staff awesome cocktail
just have to be patient -PRON- be very popular which mean -PRON- very crowd and long wait
but the bar help with that
-PRON- can recommend q spa for -PRON- be friendliness professionalism and overall atmosphere
the owner and nail technician be friendly and make -PRON- feel very welcome
if -PRON- be not for the very specified service -PRON- be look for -PRON- would probably be back
-PRON- go for an uv gel refill with french tip -PRON- choose q spa as -PRON- be in -PRON- neighbourhood and reasonably price
and again everyone be very very nice
the technician use a powder gel and airbrush on -PRON- tip two technique -PRON- have never use before
lady and any inclined gent
step away from this procedure at q spa
the next day -PRON- nail turn yellow and almost immediately the air brush tip begin to chip off
to q spa 's credit -PRON- return 2 day later and -PRON- be extremely apologetic and redo -PRON- nail on the spot
however appreciative -PRON- be for -PRON- customer service -PRON- nail once again turn yellow so embarrassing and the tip last nary a work week
-PRON- be tell later by another nail spa that the yellowing be due to the powder product react to sunlight
so not knock the lovely lady at q spa but -PRON- can not go back
some general note space be very clean but there be not any obvious evidence that the equipment be sanitize
this be something -PRON- look for when go to a spa for the first time could use some additional ventilation relax atmosphere no entertainment besides the 24 hrs new channel this be not important to -PRON- just think -PRON- would mention -PRON-
thought -PRON- be a strange channel choice for a spa no

now -PRON- be so n no way a bar kinda girl but this place be relax

the atmosphere be awesome
-PRON- be there early today and -PRON- feel so bad because -PRON- ask the tech what -PRON- name be that be help -PRON-
and now -PRON- forget

-PRON- have complicated issue with -PRON- hair hold color
not only do -PRON- find -PRON- what -PRON- be ask for -PRON- also refer -PRON- to a product call gray magic\/magic gray
then remind -PRON- that -PRON- would need squeeze bottle
not only be -PRON- hair color exactly how -PRON- want -PRON- -PRON- hair feel super soft and not as dry as -PRON- use to be
both the lady in the store be amazing and -PRON- do not get enough credit
-PRON- hope more people recognize -PRON- for a stellar job do

dr diaz be very nice and professional and -PRON- assistant very helpful and kind
if -PRON- be look to have -PRON- eye check -PRON- definitely recommend this place
this place be disgusting and appalling
any woman that let -PRON- man go here be out of -PRON- mind
-PRON- go with -PRON- boyfriend and some friend and -PRON- be so disgusted -PRON- have to leave after 5 minute
-PRON- may as well throw the money down the toilet

calamari be pretty delicious and so be the bread
the main -PRON- try be the seafood risotto mussel shrimp scallop + salmon calarmari in a rich saffron broth
okay
-PRON- guess this be pretty good
comparable to the average italian resto probably would have stand out to -PRON- more if -PRON- do not stuff -PRON- on the app
overall probably one of the good italian resto in markham
meh
while -PRON- do not have any experience with the rental department the sale department be need some serious lesson in customer service
late example call to ask whether -PRON- carry an intervalometer for -PRON- camera and be meet with a 10 minute hold on the phone

-PRON- be invite by two lovely yelper to join -PRON- for some soba on a rainy tuesday night
one of -PRON- companion take heap of photo so stay tune
the owner a former salaryman who immigrate to canada do not have a shop of -PRON- own
rather -PRON- rent out the space of other establishment to sell -PRON- product
-PRON- remember when -PRON- could order -PRON- soba from nakamura bakery at j town
-PRON- now set up shop at ichiriki on tuesday evening
-PRON- order the chef 's omakase leave -PRON- up to chef which be $ 20 even

bowl 1
tororo japanese yam
bowl 2 snow crab

bowl 3 tofu w green onion be not a fan of 1 but 2 and 3 be good
the menu be not extensive and there be nothing warm on the menu
-PRON- would have be happy if there be warm tempura soba on the menu
overall not too shabby of a place
-PRON- think -PRON- enjoy the company more than anything
wow
really disappointed
thank god for terrific breadstick and salad or this rating would be negative star
experience be terrible from the rude hostess team one of which be change -PRON- clothe in the lobby while those of -PRON- wait have to watch to the indifferent almost effecient wait staff
better be careful olive garden
customer service be still important
weak
taste even bad than -PRON- frozen meal at grocery store
go to mcdonald instead
-PRON- son take -PRON- here for -PRON- mother 's day gift
be amazing
-PRON- have meatball and pizza for app
-PRON- have lobster ravioli and -PRON- have short rib
both excellent
pricey but worth -PRON-
-PRON- have a very nice evening
the 5 star be base only on -PRON- experience with sunday hungover brunch
-PRON- come here always to fill up great selection and variety in -PRON- buffet
eggs bene prime rib antipasto bacon
how can -PRON- go wrong
sure -PRON- a bit dated maybe
who care the food be awesome for buffet
beat burger in kent by far

:p -PRON- can not go wrong eating at rays
-PRON- also have a huge beer selection from around the world so if -PRON- like to drink the sud
cross country flight on american charlotte to los angeles
be there no screen on this flight
no
there be nothing
but -PRON- can stream from -PRON- own device
okay
where do -PRON- plug in -PRON- phone then
nowhere
there be no screen and no outlet
the plane be so loud
headphone at full volume could not touch -PRON-
like rid in a seat bolt to the wing
a person 's small angry dog be shove under -PRON- seat
every time -PRON- adjust -PRON- foot -PRON- snarl and bark try to bite -PRON- through the mesh of -PRON- cage
-PRON- be truly the fung wah bus of cross country flight
but pretty much all the airline be terrible now
virgin america have be good to -PRON- the few time -PRON- have use -PRON-
and norwegian while -PRON- luggage policy be draconian and -PRON- have to pay for meal optional and even a regular seat assignment have screen on every seat and -PRON- ticket price seriously reflect the lack of amenity
-PRON- once fly from vilnius to stockholm for $ 12.80
american and other us airline want to dump all the amenity and still charge a regular price
-PRON- order vegetarian manchurian pakora manchurian noodle chop suey chicken in black bean sauce a soup and schechuan fry rice for take out
have read great review about lotus garden and the food do not disappoint
manchurian be crisp on the outside and super soft on the inside
-PRON- have pack the gravy separately sensibly
the noodle and rice be hot to taste and red in color reminiscent of the hakka cuisine back home
the chicken in black bean sauce be the highlight though
all in all well worth the 1\/2 hr drive
highly recommend
this be -PRON- 2nd time to this particular cheesecake factory
-PRON- return after receive a gift card for christmas
after have just a decent jambalaya on the first visit a 2-star visit i go with the cajun ribeye with mash potato instead of fry
-PRON- also come with onion string and asparagus
-PRON- be very good
-PRON- be a hefty portion for a hefty $ 30 price tag
-PRON- server be excellent on this trip
-PRON- be friendly and on top of refill
the other entree -PRON- order be the chicken marsala and -PRON- be just ok
-PRON- would not order -PRON- again
the 6 o'clock sweat strike here as well
see alessandra 's review for detail
the ribeye and the service make this a 3 star review
even though -PRON- have a reservation here -PRON- fully expect to have to wait a while for -PRON- table
parking lot pack check
lot of folk on the entrance patio check
large group exit while -PRON- be enter check
yep -PRON- be go to be a long wait
but -PRON- be not
-PRON- be seat immediately and -PRON- server rio come over and promptly introduce -PRON-
let -PRON- tell -PRON- this rio 's attention to -PRON- table be first class
-PRON- be very amiable and be patient and engage with -PRON- too talkative and over share father
rio make -PRON- feel like -PRON- be -PRON- only customer
-PRON- do -PRON- good to make sure that -PRON- be satisfied
ask to be seat in rio 's section if -PRON- want great service
-PRON- order 1\/2 dozen blue point on the half shell
seven of those succulent oyster arrive at -PRON- table with ketchupy cocktail sauce horseradish and mignonette as topping
the mignonette be tasty and who do not love raw horseradish
yummy
-PRON- dad and -PRON- both have naked scallop with broccolini and lemon caper sauce on the side for -PRON- main
-PRON- specifically ask rio for steamed veg no butter
the plate arrive with four scallop not three because of -PRON- size -PRON- guess and a shiny portion of broccolini
-PRON- ask rio again for just steamed veg and -PRON- happily comply with a smile and a new portion arrive within minute still shiny
rio bring another serve as well in case -PRON- be not satisfied
rio really be a customer service pro
scallops be delicious and perfectly cook although the lemon caper sauce be undistinguished
three serving of identical broccolini convince -PRON- that -PRON- must spray oil on the veg in the kitchen
-PRON- just do not get that
-PRON- would give pappadeaux food 3.5 star but rio 's service elevate -PRON- rating to four
this be a very small sushi restaurant -PRON- seem like -PRON- be only operate with 1 server and 1 chef who be manage both the sushi bar and the cooking in the kitchen
there be exactly 20 seat in this narrow restaurant
-PRON- think -PRON- mostly provide take out or delivery service for the neighbourhood that be why -PRON- do not need that many table
if -PRON- do want to dine in -PRON- also take reservation
however -PRON- be kind of disappointed
the food be alright -PRON- will give -PRON- a 3.5 star just slightly good than an average sushi joint
the service be super slow
well -PRON- be not sure if that be a fair statement but at least -PRON- be ridiculously slow when -PRON- go on dec 31st new year
eve
-PRON- get to improve this if -PRON- want -PRON- customer to return
unless like -PRON- mention above -PRON- target market be take out and delivery
go here a few day ago
server do not get -PRON- full order but -PRON- work customer service\/serv
so -PRON- do not say anything and the white dragon roll that -PRON- do receive be very fresh large sized almost to large embarrassing to eat on a date do not wanna be catch open -PRON- mouth that wide haha
this be the first time -PRON- have eat fish of any kind in over 15 year -PRON- be call snapper white fish hence the white dragon name
miso soup be same as any japanese restaurant green salad -PRON- be not generally a fan of the piece be too large -PRON- do not like the dressing and -PRON- seem like -PRON- be all the white chunk leave of the lettuce
decor be really modern romantic clean and new looking love the candlelight dinner and dark chocolate coloured setting with fireplace in the middle
seating be space out and there be room for -PRON- leg and the person beside -PRON- and infront
nice staff member all greet when -PRON- enter and leave the place -PRON- will not go out of -PRON- way to eat here again but if -PRON- be in the area -PRON- be a good option
follow the great review on this site -PRON- venture to this coffee shop in search of some great coffee and pastry at lunchtime
-PRON- love coffee maybe too much
-PRON- order 2 skinny latte in mug so that -PRON- could sit in the store and chat
first -PRON- be tell -PRON- have no mug that would take a latte only have paper cup
then call back to till and tell -PRON- -PRON- have no skim milk fair enough 2 then
nope no 2
-PRON- only have whole milk -PRON- say incredulously
do not have that either only almond milk
-PRON- give up and walk out
as far as whole food be concern
psychology -PRON- would call this the approach avoidance conflict
there be so many good thing about this whole foods yet the bad be start to gain in number
how be -PRON- that this store in madison happen to not have many organic fruit a lot of the time now
and other store do
why have -PRON- not move to a large location when obviously -PRON- need more room for parking way more room in the isle and more organic fruit
why do not -PRON- build one on the east side so people do not have to go as far and crowd up the west side store
and parking on certain day forget -PRON-
-PRON- be come from lake mills to shop there
after live in ca and go to the wf there this store seem to be the small and the least stock with item and internal restaurant because of -PRON- size
who own this place and why do not -PRON- move and expand
-PRON- be agree with another writer here -PRON- may be time to check out woodmans and -PRON- be indeed sad to have to say this
whole food in madison be -PRON- listen to -PRON- customer
-PRON- have always like target
this be a nice location sort of tuck away and seclude
-PRON- prefer that
-PRON- have buy everything from linen to car oil clothe and cosmetic here
always a nice selection and reasonably price
-PRON- love -PRON- makeup section
-PRON- be very clean and organized
-PRON- have a great selection as well include nyx and sonia kashuk
-PRON- go to the brick to look at dishwasher
-PRON- be approach by an employee who make a deal with -PRON- and -PRON- wife for an lg dishwasher
this same dishwasher be almost $ 150 more at all the other store
so -PRON- be quite happy
-PRON- be tell at the time of purchase that there be 8 dishwasher in stock and the -PRON- could expect delivery on wednesday 5 day after purchase
this be confirm when -PRON- go to customer service who again confirm that shipping would be wednesday and that someone would call between 8 am and 11 be to ask if -PRON- be home
wednesday morning and afternoon pass
-PRON- have a technician which -PRON- call at 1 p.m.
since no dishwasher come -PRON- be not able to set -PRON- up
-PRON- end up loose $ 50 for -PRON- service fee
when -PRON- go back to the brick to find out what happen
-PRON- say that -PRON- be due to deliver a month later and that -PRON- have never tell -PRON- -PRON- would deliver wednesday
-PRON- say that the item have be out of stock for a while and a new shipment be due in a month
after ask to see the manager the customer service rep
make a few call and out of thin air find a unit that could be ship saturday
the manager come around and show -PRON- the bill of sale which have nothing fill out under delivery date
the manager then proceed to blame -PRON- for not check this and say that the protocol be to make a confirmation of delivery call 3 day before delivery
the customer service rep then correct -PRON- and say -PRON- be 5 day before delivery which be when -PRON- buy the product
-PRON- spend over an hour at the store during which -PRON- simply ask for $ 50 for the technician fee that -PRON- incur
again the manager blame -PRON- and say -PRON- could do nothing but apologize
with such a big name like the brick -PRON- would expect the good customer service but this be a very bad experience for -PRON- an -PRON- wife
-PRON- have go to other brick location and have a much good experience
just do not go to this location

the house magurita be reasonably price and enjoyable to taste
for -PRON- entre -PRON- order the beef enchilada and -PRON- thoroughly enjoy -PRON-

-PRON- have never have anything like -PRON- in -PRON- life
-PRON- be delicious
-PRON- server be attentive and make sure -PRON- be happy throughout -PRON- dining experience
-PRON- plan on visit often

-PRON- will never go back
good little middle eastern restaurant
good service
great hummus serve with a type of bread that -PRON- have not have before -PRON- be sort of like naan but not quite
-PRON- entrée be also good
only negative comment -PRON- have be that -PRON- lamb dish be a bit pricey imho
this place be a bit far away from -PRON- home
so -PRON- may not return but -PRON- do recommend -PRON-
-PRON- can not thank pattie freeman enough for all the help -PRON- have give -PRON-
-PRON- use to suffer from fear and anxiety that would interfere with -PRON- daily activity
for year -PRON- have only be able to drive to work and go straight home
after just a few session with pattie
-PRON- feel -PRON- be no longer a prisoner
and -PRON- be free to live a life to -PRON- full
-PRON- fear and frustration while drive in arizona be no longer there
when -PRON- first meet pattie
-PRON- put -PRON- right at ease
and -PRON- listen with -PRON- heart
-PRON- make -PRON- feel very comfortable
-PRON- compassion and understanding be just one of the thing that set -PRON- apart from the rest
-PRON- would highly recommend -PRON- to anyone who be ready for a positive change in -PRON- life
-PRON- be a picky cupcake eater
some of -PRON- favorite include magnolia in nyc and kara 's cupcake in san francisco
-PRON- probably have 3 cupcake for an event that sweet girl cupcakes cater
the cake be moist and the frosting be just all goodness with a good frosting to cake ratio
-PRON- be delicious and so beautifully do
-PRON- just wish -PRON- live closer

-PRON- purchase a prius here and -PRON- love -PRON- prius
-PRON- also buy an extended car care program

also -PRON- send an email to the service manager rick and of course no response
-PRON- will pay more for good service
-PRON- be not here -PRON- friend
the matcha ice cream be the good in the gta
the matcha flavour be rich and the soft serve be smooth
the black sesame be also very rich
but -PRON- be not a fan of black sesame
-PRON- be not a fan of the other dessert but likely because -PRON- soft serve be great on -PRON- be own
-PRON- be a huge fan of harem
the ambiance be perfect for hookah and have a well stock bar do not hurt either
be a small business the service do suffer slightly on busy night but flag down any of the friendly staff solve that problem right away
-PRON- third time here
and -PRON- must say that -PRON- definitely be a charm
alyssa greet -PRON- and display exceptional customer service as usual
ceasar the chef show consideration by personally ask -PRON- about -PRON- preference of -PRON- order
the food be always fresh and full of flavor
order the volcano blacken mahi fish with brown rice
also order the hawaiian teriyaki shrimp with the rumbi rice
always a pleasure to eat at rumbi island grill
the website really do not amount to the property in person
-PRON- be absolutely amazing
the amenity alone be enough to make -PRON- want to move in
the apartment unit be unlike any other -PRON- have see before
every detail from the kitchen to the bathroom be stunning
liz who work there be awesome
-PRON- give -PRON- a wonderful tour of the property and answer all of -PRON- question in detail
-PRON- be super excited to move in to this gorgeous property
the husband and -PRON- go here for dinner takeout last night

-PRON- be delicious
when -PRON- go out to eat -PRON- usually want to try a bunch of thing and have leftover so -PRON- husband get lemongrass beef
if -PRON- like pepper that be the dish for -PRON-
the beef be very peppery tasting but the lemongrass add a deep flavor too
in spite of not particularly enjoy pepper -PRON- find -PRON- steal bite
as other review have say the portion be large and inexpensive
two people could easily eat here for $ 7
the restaurant be small and -PRON- be crowd when -PRON- go
-PRON- would recommend takeout
edit 5\/19\/16 get bad stomach issue after eat here
-PRON- can not in good faith recommend this place after this experience
reduce -PRON- rating from 4 to 2 star
this be a cool new idea
the pizza be ok
-PRON- be mostly give -PRON- 4 star because the idea be really cool and convenient
a good lunch spot for down town worker for sure
-PRON- stay here in october for -PRON- 25th wedding anniversary

-PRON- go to dr. kaplan for a few year as -PRON- primary doctor
two main thing lead -PRON- to fire -PRON- as -PRON- primary care physician
1
lack of attention
-PRON- take a personal phone call on -PRON- cell phone mid sentence when -PRON- be talk to -PRON-
which be possibly one of the most irritate thing that can occur when -PRON- pay someone to listen to -PRON-
second to that -PRON- discover that -PRON- do not read -PRON- chart before see -PRON-
this -PRON- know because of the nonsensical question that -PRON- ask -PRON- that be document in -PRON- file
2
-PRON- be consistently late
after observe that this always seem to be the case -PRON- get the first appointment of the day
-PRON- be then that -PRON- notice that -PRON- do not even make -PRON- into the office until 30 45 min past -PRON- appointment time
-PRON- actually hear -PRON- enter the office and be greet by -PRON- staff
-PRON- then see numerous people before ever get to -PRON-
and once -PRON- watch read 1 hour past the appointment time as the first appointment of the day -PRON- tell -PRON- nurse -PRON- be do with -PRON-
-PRON- make -PRON- refund the cost of that visit and -PRON- never go back
-PRON- send dr. kaplan a strongly word letter explain how disappointing -PRON- behavior be
and -PRON- ask -PRON- to pay -PRON- $ 50.00 for waste -PRON- time
-PRON- feel that be very reasonable
-PRON- call -PRON- to apologize but do not pay -PRON- for the time -PRON- waste
there be much good physician out there -PRON- can not recommend this guy
go to downtown mesa on a tuesday afternoon hop to get lunch at monster land

urban picnic operate out of a very small space but -PRON- make good use of -PRON-
the interior feature matte white wall high ceiling with expose wooden rafter high gloss wood furniture contemporary lighting and concrete floor
-PRON- use an ipad for a register
initially base off the nice interior -PRON- be a bit concerned that the food wood be overprice
not so
-PRON- order the wild mushroom parmesan press sandwich and -PRON- lunch mate order the caprese
both be price at about $ 8 and come with a choice of side
the serving be very substantial and both be absolutely delicious
the mushroom sandwich have perfectly crunchy press bread and be overflow with creamy mushroom fill very decadent
the caprese come on a very tasty french baguette with nice thick slice of mozzarella and freshly slice thin strip of basil
-PRON- also order lavender infuse lemonade the special drink of the day which be very quench on a 100 degree october day in arizona
highly recommend
also the staff be very friendly
-PRON- overheard -PRON- mention that -PRON- be run a little late to get somewhere and without -PRON- ask at all go back into the kitchen and rush the order out a little faster
just walk out of this establishment
go because of good review on yelp
do not even stay to finish -PRON- happy hour drink that have no alcohol in -PRON-
chip be stale and salsa uneatable
-PRON- travel with a service dog and be tell -PRON- be not welcome here
that be against the law people

all the time the two asian guy work be bicker swear and fight with each other
will never go back again
nice restaurant slightly overprice but food generally tasty
-PRON- personally do not have any problem with the service but other say different
not the beat italian restaurant around but worth a visit to compare
this have become -PRON- family favorite theater
-PRON- be 1 exit away from -PRON- home and have really awesome seat
the chair recline and the walkway in front of the seat be huge make -PRON- a lot easy to get up and walk past other patron when -PRON- need to excuse -PRON-
the only thing that -PRON- wish -PRON- would change be the amount of seat available because -PRON- sell out so fast on new release
perhaps this be due to the spacious walkway between each row of seating but -PRON- would not want -PRON- to take that away
so -PRON- be ok
-PRON- love -PRON- beverage menu
-PRON- can order a beer wine or margarita on the rock or slush
the service be great and -PRON- have never have an issue with anything at this galaxy theater
so happy this restaurant open near -PRON- house
for the long time -PRON- would have to drive down to spring mountain to get good pho
-PRON- can say -PRON- no longer need to drive down there for pho
-PRON- order the pho thai and -PRON- be amazing
so sad -PRON- open when -PRON- be move away at the end of the year

love -PRON-
great soul food
portions on gargantuan
cook to order so be patient
wish -PRON- live closer
so -PRON- could check out -PRON- breakfast
definitely will be back
this be the ideal spot if -PRON- want to avoid the strip and the sketchy downtown area perfect for -PRON- family trip to zion death valley
get everything -PRON- need in the building plenty of gambling restauraunt entertainment
close to airport and rental car agency
parking be free but -PRON- be a hassle
there be a deck and a front yard but regardless where -PRON- park -PRON- have to walk the long way through the casino to the elevator to the hotel room
-PRON- understand a giant chunk of revenue come from casino and force people to travel through casino but -PRON- tiring when all -PRON- want to do be pass out
build a side entrance please
bed be clean and comfy no issue there
clean staff come in while -PRON- be still rest leave when -PRON- realize -PRON- be inside
but -PRON- be pretty sure -PRON- have the dnd on
coupon book have two free alcoholic beverage and lot of good discount rate
-PRON- give -PRON- two but if -PRON- pay for extra guest fee make sure to ask for more book
-PRON- love the garden buffet
what a steal for a ton of good food and bloody mary all day
yum
the doctor here be great but the staff be unorganized and do not know what -PRON- be do
be there for over 2 hour
-PRON- get quote one price for frame and -PRON- go ahead and pay half and pay the other half when -PRON- pick -PRON- up
well -PRON- get a phone call today say the frame -PRON- pick be not cover by -PRON- insurance so now -PRON- owe way more than originaly quote
all sale be final which be crap because -PRON- make the mistake
never go here again and -PRON- do not recommend anybody else to go here either until -PRON- change the staff
-PRON- wife also just add this
ya -PRON- bull***t
first -PRON- can not communicate and make -PRON- redo test
then tell -PRON- -PRON- be good when -PRON- still have to see the doc
then do not even pay attention to -PRON- insurance coverage
this place be beautiful
original woodwork adorable little booth that look like -PRON- own cozy train car a slate walkway that invite -PRON- inside but not a very invite staff
-PRON- have make reservation for -PRON- partner birthday back in October -PRON- can not check in anywhere in chagrin falls the wi fi be non existent
-PRON- find out the hard way if -PRON- own a blackberry
-PRON- can not use yelp or any other useful app but when -PRON- arrive there be no hostess or staff to be find
after debate what to do the bartender eventually come to -PRON- rescue ten minute later
while -PRON- be wait -PRON- have classical playing in the bar that -PRON- could hear through the window what put -PRON- off be the awful rap music -PRON- could hear loudly play from the kitchen
-PRON- could not even hear -PRON- partner sit directly next to -PRON- have to listen to this crap throughout the entire meal
the building -PRON- be very cold and the creepy little women bathroom be like walk into the cooler at work
tiny dark and freezing
-PRON- partner love -PRON- food venison tartar etc
but -PRON- be so unimpressed with the menu -PRON- do not order anything
even the desert option be a disappointment and the price be way too high
$ 16.00 for a pile of fry with gravy cheese on it- seriously
-PRON- could get those at bob evans for less then $ 8.00 and guarantee -PRON- would taste the same
even the unwind -PRON- mind martini -PRON- have could not help -PRON- relax
-PRON- waiter however feel so bad that -PRON- have not order anything that -PRON- ask the chef if -PRON- could just give -PRON- a plate of plain fry and not charge -PRON- the full price -PRON- waiter be awesome and have a great sense of humor
in fact -PRON- company be the only part of the meal -PRON- enjoy
maybe -PRON- be be too critical here -PRON- be not that -PRON- would not recommend this place
but -PRON- will break -PRON- wallet and -PRON- heart if -PRON- be an animal lover
-PRON- partner pick this place out -PRON- do not care for all the taxidermist critter on the wall or the overall service
when -PRON- get to a place like this -PRON- expect a little more and not to feel as if -PRON- be sit in a run down club
oh johnnie 's -PRON- be so fine -PRON- be so fine -PRON- blow -PRON- weenie
ok so -PRON- do not rhyme but mr. chang owner of johnnie 's be a force to be reckon with
-PRON- smile
-PRON- greet
take -PRON- order
make the food
and be obviously passionate about what -PRON- do
-PRON- even have homemade chocolate cake for less than $ 2 a slice
but -PRON- be about the chicago dog for -PRON-
neon green relish
pickle
tomato
celery salt
mustard
onion
on a steamed poppy seed bun which -PRON- be sure will because -PRON- to test poz for opiate
for less than $ 4 -PRON- get -PRON- weenie and some delish fry
-PRON- be so glad -PRON- go back and can not wait to have a chicago dog make by an asian man in the desert
this hotel be fantastic
clean and roomy with full kitchen which be very helpful for -PRON- family
the staff be overly and refreshingly accommodate
-PRON- appreciate -PRON- warmth effort
centrally locate for -PRON- activity do perfect
only bad part be the extremely overwhelmed valet parking guy who clearly need help
that say -PRON- be quite rude unaccommodating and do not answer -PRON- phone
so -PRON- have trouble get -PRON- car
would still stay again
this be a really great place to sit down and work
the people who work there be always friendly
there be a central table to plug -PRON- laptop into like a central command for some movie about central command thing then everywhere else have couch and table
there be also gelato and a variety of different soda
only thing -PRON- find wrong with -PRON- be -PRON- keep want to say coffee unlimited instead of unlimited coffee
-PRON- feel -PRON- be more coffee + unlimited horizon instead of drink coffee forever
-PRON- can not believe -PRON- do not look at review before -PRON- order delivery from here for the first time last night
be -PRON- crazy
who do that anymore
-PRON- must have be in a hunger trance
luckily -PRON- be not as terrible quality wise as the low yelp score imply
but -PRON- understand the meh rating and find -PRON- accurate
-PRON- actually think the food be delicious but totally overprice for the underwhelming portion
-PRON- also do not win any point by not provide any white rice to go with -PRON- entree
wtf else be -PRON- suppose to put curry on
to further break -PRON- down pad thai $ 10 15 be fairly tasty as fast food pad thai generally go
overpriced
thai spicy eggplant $ 10 be tasty as hell
-PRON- think -PRON- be the sauce
pineapple red curry shrimp $ 13 be also tasty as hell but there be barely any shrimp to speak of
or pineapple for that matter
so -PRON- be pretty much a $ 13 sauce
ginger tamarind fish a ludicrous $ 18 be not the fillet -PRON- anticipate instead be a small clump of mostly skin and bone
but -PRON- be a tasty as hell clump in sauce
be -PRON- sense a pattern
in summation so much sauce so little rice none
food be really good but -PRON- be a worthy option only if -PRON- have 1
some sort of significant discount and 2 rice
come up from atlanta for a show
this place feel like home
kaleigh ashley and all the staff treat -PRON- awesomely
play dart with some local make friend and have great beer
10\/10 would do again -PRON- actually go back the next day
-PRON- drive by this place often but never go in until today
the food taste great especially the lechon kiwali
-PRON- have great variety and everything be fresh
must give this place a try when -PRON- be in the area
stop by for -PRON- first lunchtime meal
good burger decent beer selection great new look for a historic location
-PRON- have pour ton of money into the revocation make this a sturdy fresh look building
wonderful seating on two floor and a rooftop patio that be unrivaled in brampton
great staff
this be -PRON- new spot creative menu
-PRON- have a lot of fun eat here
try out the french toast so bomb
cool local spot check -PRON- out
isle de garde enter -PRON- list of new bar -PRON- need to visit urgently as soon -PRON- read the review from karine s. expectations have be set high and satisfied well by the extensive choice of local beer
-PRON- the old people arrive around 7 p.m. on saturday and the bar be already pack but -PRON- manage to get -PRON- own spot of counter type in the second room
later during the night when the young population of montreal infiltrate the bar people would be just stand up and drinking
the bar offer also nice list of food option
-PRON- have the marinate pork tongue serve in a jar with toast baguette and mustard delicious snack for good brew
service be great
the guy handle very professionally the concern that the second pint of the smoky punkraugh lager do not taste the same may be -PRON- do a mistake when -PRON- just order the same or -PRON- just change the keg but -PRON- bring immediately a small tasting glass and substitute the pint in question
besides that -PRON- enjoy the floor in the bathroom which be of numismatic value
ultimately -PRON- be happy to see another bar where -PRON- can explore the amazing quebec beer
-PRON- just seem like everything here that be not salad be so one note no layer of flavor pretty much just garlic
that being say -PRON- be a fast easy lunch option in a busy district and the server have always be very nice and attentive which be always a good thing
but honestly with the choice of food in the area this will hardly ever be -PRON- choice just not good enough to beat out the other restaurant around
-PRON- use -PRON- to finance an new vehicle
-PRON- make the purchase in ca a process -PRON- be tell would be very smooth and simple
unfortunately -PRON- have be very confusing unsettling and frustrating
after receive the email that -PRON- have be approve for the request loan amount -PRON- go shop
-PRON- purchase the vehicle and a warranty through desert schools
the day after the purchase so
-PRON- had
already be drive the vehicle around -PRON- receive a phone call from desert schools to let -PRON- know -PRON- have be deny
apparently there be 3 application submit for -PRON- 2 of which be inaccurate
apparently the lady a spoke to submit 3 inquiry on -PRON- credit
everyone
-PRON- talked
to be so incredibly rude and no one really seemed
all that competant
then a lady from the processing department call again the day after the purchase be make and -PRON- drive the vehicle home to let -PRON- know that -PRON- have not receive a purchase order
-PRON- be mistaken -PRON- receive the title and the purchase order with the vin number and have send -PRON- back to the dealership approve
no one really know what be go on ever
and there be obviously zero cross communication between department
-PRON- would reccommend chase bank or pretty much any other lending institution over desert schools
be to this location a few time
the food as -PRON- all know be alright
nothing to go all nut about
so where -PRON- always win -PRON- extra star be the service
-PRON- have nail -PRON- down
the wait be less and the waiter be on the spot
and off course the cheesecake
-PRON- use to be a big fan of -PRON- here
then one wise day
-PRON- see the calorie in -PRON- and rest all be history
4.5 star -PRON- co worker give -PRON- a key lime macaroon and -PRON- be awesome kind of like a whoppie pie but not as sweet
just the right balance of lime
so -PRON- husband happen to mention -PRON- be go to tempe
so -PRON- ask -PRON- to bring some macaroon home
-PRON- love -PRON- and so do -PRON- daughter
no so sure about the espresso flavor
-PRON- be a little pricey base on the size but flakey and delicious
absolute katastrophe die burger wurden kalt serviert und die sofortige reklamation mit einem sorry ist grad viel lo abgetan
so nicht
neuer heißer burger aber zack
hat dann auch halbweg geklappt
zur qualität kann ich dann leider auch nicht wirklich positive berichten
das fleisch fettig der krautsalat fürchterlich die pommes gingen sogar einigermaßen
mein resümee ein besuch beim mcdoof wäre die bessere entscheidung gewesen
ein stern ist schon fast zu viel
wobei der für die recht gut aussehenden bedienungen ist
theme of the night sloooooow the night start out promising the hostess be notably attentive and friendly
jessica the bartender be solid and knowledgeable
but -PRON- be downhill from there
-PRON- waiter introduce -PRON- and -PRON- partner
friendly enough guy
-PRON- take -PRON- drink order but then disappear for 15 minute
as the drink be finally deliver the joke start about order round 2 right then so that -PRON- would have -PRON- by the time -PRON- drink these
little do -PRON- know how true that would ring
after 30 minute -PRON- have to call the waiter back over to take -PRON- order
thirty minute
-PRON- food come 45 minute later
yes -PRON- receive -PRON- entree almost 90 minute after -PRON- sit down
this be not a 5 star restaurant where that may be ok people
to -PRON- waiter 's credit -PRON- do keep -PRON- somewhat updated let -PRON- know the kitchen be run slow\/behind and take an entree off the bill
but -PRON- be not too attentive
otherwise keep -PRON- fill on drink at least por favor
notice
-PRON- have not say anything about the food
-PRON- be ok not bad but nothing memorable
but mostly since the experience have be ruin by the time the food finally come -PRON- would not really have matter how good the food be
the 3 a.m. meal at chicago brewing company be more memorable and enjoyable than this if that tell -PRON- anything
-PRON- have be come to this salon on and off for the past couple year
-PRON- have always have okay experience until this last time
-PRON- walk in and -PRON- give -PRON- to erick
-PRON- have never feel more take care of by any hair consultant
-PRON- have curly hair and people usually do not cut -PRON- right
and -PRON- become a frizzy mess
erick explain everything -PRON- be do and make sure -PRON- be okay with everything
both time -PRON- have go to -PRON- -PRON- hair have be rejuvenate and look and feeling refresh
will definitely be come back to see erick every time now
thank -PRON- erick
really impressed on the wide range of store selection
especially the high end store
definitely will be back to do more shopping
a welcome addition to a neighborhood bereft of any nice restaurant or bar but a few kink still need to be work out
the cocktail be reasonably price and creative but most non classic end of be far too sweet
a friend order a rye base drink in which the citrus be more forward than any smoke from the whiskey
the manahattan be good but again a bit on the sweet side
spirit selection be great here however so that or beer may be the way to go
the food be interesting
totally fine overall but nothing noteworthy
-PRON- agree that the entree seem a bit overpriced though the appetizer be not bad
some of the good thing -PRON- have be the ricotta fritter and cheese plate both of which have a great honey drizzle over -PRON-
but -PRON- order the mussel and clam as a main and be genuinely puzzle to find what look like patata brava dump on top of the middle of the dish
yep mayo and undercooked potato right in the middle of what be otherwise a delicious dish sauce be great
hopefully the menu get simplify and the chef stick with simple but good dish rather than complicated and lackluster one
-PRON- be quickly sit at a dirty table
the ice tea be exceptionally bitter
the spinach artichoke dip be good not great and rather expensive
the caesar salad be good but as an odd complaint the fork be not design for salad -PRON- take constant stabbing at the salad to pick up a piece of lettuce
love this spot
-PRON- be pretty close to the convention center
so natalie and -PRON- go here to check -PRON- out
the bacon be awesome here
-PRON- philosophy be great too local organic etc etc
the place be tiny and quaint too and as always -PRON- be great to support a local independent business
good breakfast in phoenix that -PRON- have have and definitely one of -PRON- fave spot go there the next day too get the special and -PRON- be delish check -PRON- photo to see what -PRON- get
an authentic vegetarian south indian restaurant
there be no flea fruit fly and -PRON- food be serve hot and do not appear to be re heated from the day before just want to clear that up before -PRON- start -PRON- review if -PRON- have ever be to a south indian restaurant in india -PRON- would love this place because -PRON- have everything setup just like -PRON- be in south india -PRON- have a hand wash station
yes people still eat with -PRON- hand in south india and a few do in this restaurant if -PRON- bother -PRON- then
-PRON- suggest -PRON- do not go here
the food be authentic and be price right there be ton of vegan option this be a vegetarian restaurant so if -PRON- be vegetarian -PRON- do not have to worry about anything just order anything from the menu
there be plenty of space to sit and lot of parking in the mall 's parking lot
the place can get busy on weekend
if -PRON- have never have south indian food before -PRON- would highly recommend -PRON- try the masala dosa as -PRON- first dish
everything here be serve in stainless steel dish if -PRON- be in south india -PRON- would be on banana leaf see as -PRON- will not have banana tree in toronto anytime soon stainless steel will suffice service be mediocre if -PRON- want something after -PRON- have already order and receive -PRON- food -PRON- can be a challenge to get the server 's attention depend on how busy the place be
try something new and different and -PRON- will not be disappoint
meat and potato lover stay away this be not a place for -PRON-

pro daiquiris
-PRON- have a great assortment of flavor and -PRON- have never a have flavor that taste bad
most of the flavor be on the sweet side and -PRON- will rarely taste alcohol as -PRON- consume -PRON-
the good flavor be the pina colada since -PRON- both creamy and sweet
$ 1 shot
-PRON- can add additional shot which only cost $ 1 more
-PRON- do not blend the shot in -PRON- drink but -PRON- have each shot in a clear plastic tube which -PRON- insert in all drink

when -PRON- call back into find out the height restriction -PRON- realize that -PRON- incorrectly book -PRON- reservation for a truck and could not allow -PRON- to keep the truck
one of -PRON- agent sue taylor yell at -PRON- on the phone tell -PRON- that there be nothing -PRON- or anyone can do would not transfer -PRON- to -PRON- management and tell -PRON- -PRON- be out of luck

update the same manager call -PRON- back and leave a voice mail advise -PRON- that -PRON- be a liar for post this review online
-PRON- do not understand the management have to time harass -PRON- customer instead of call to advise -PRON- of change to the promise -PRON- make

-PRON- highly recommend -PRON-
-PRON- consult jeff regard a property on 10th street and maryland
the rental price be above what be reasonable for this property but -PRON- be willing to pay because -PRON- love the area
without even meet -PRON- or consult the homeowner to see if -PRON- would be ok with this decision jeff decline -PRON- interest because -PRON- be an attorney state that attorney be major pain in the ass for no reason

-PRON- have a feel jeff 's lack of professionalism be the reason -PRON- tenant be a pain in the ass
-PRON- would not rent from this guy
and -PRON- certainly would not trust -PRON- to find a tenant for -PRON- rental property
-PRON- family try to stop in here every time -PRON- be near the place for dinner
friendly people work there and -PRON- make -PRON- up fast and quick plus -PRON- do not have to pay a damn wait or wait for -PRON- food very long
if -PRON- do not mind grab -PRON- own soda or drink and clean up after -PRON- -PRON- be a pretty good deal
side be pretty good include the macaroni and cheese and the bean
-PRON- coleslaw be the vinegar style so -PRON- do not really care for -PRON- personally but if that be -PRON- thing
-PRON- be sure -PRON- will like -PRON-

-PRON- family have eat food from rickshaws several time and on each of the occasion -PRON- have be impress with the quality and heat of the food
the only thing to note be that delivery can sometimes be slow on busy night eg friday
as far as gym go there be not much good
this be -PRON- second stint now at energy after move to the other side of town
even after a couple year not much have change which be good consider the amount of upkeep -PRON- take to run a gym
the lay out be perfect with ton of equipment cardio cinema crossfit basketball raquetball kid play area super clean locker room and all the class that -PRON- need
the price have go up considerable since the first time -PRON- sign up but still well worth the price increase
good grandma pie around
crust be thin and crispy
all around good pizza place in the area
-PRON- have online ordering which -PRON- think be great on those busy night where -PRON- just want to pick up
-PRON- hear this be a good sushi place and since -PRON- be do a staycation at jw marriott nearby -PRON- try -PRON-
-PRON- be not impressed
there be nothing really wrong with the sushi but -PRON- way over price and the serving be miniscule
-PRON- pay $ 14.50 for a caterpillar which be no more than 1.5 in diameter and only 8 long
-PRON- could hardly find the eel in -PRON-
-PRON- pay $ 13.50 for some yellowtail sashimi

-PRON- want $ 3.50 for edaname
the place be nice
the service be good but -PRON- bring -PRON- wife 's entree about 5 minute after -PRON- sushi so -PRON- have to let -PRON- sit while -PRON- wait
-PRON- believe this place be high than ra and not nearly as good
bad burger experience -PRON- have have in recent memory
-PRON- taste like old burgerking but not even as good
the people be nice enough but totally unorganized
-PRON- mess up -PRON- order twice and be pretty flustered in how -PRON- handle -PRON-
all that would be fine
-PRON- guess if the food be awesome
but -PRON- be not
no matter how much -PRON- want -PRON- to be
super guy honest and fast reasonable price
fix -PRON- mower while -PRON- wait
highly recommend
greenhouse be one of the good restaurant in cleveland
while -PRON- have unique food -PRON- be still a casual place to go for any meal include late night and brunch

-PRON- the cashier not the baby be very friendly and helpful
-PRON- order the club sandwich with no mayo
-PRON- recommend that -PRON- get the mayo on the side since -PRON- be delicious and the sandwich may be too dry
-PRON- accept -PRON- offer
with each sandwich -PRON- get a choice of a side and -PRON- opt for fresh seasonal fruit
the club sandwich be absolutely enormous
-PRON- be not kid this thing have to be about 6 inch high
-PRON- be not quite sure how to eat -PRON-
maybe because -PRON- be not a part of the club so i crush -PRON- down to a manageable height
-PRON- eat the first half with none of the mayo and -PRON- be the good club sandwich -PRON- have ever eat
-PRON- could tell -PRON- use very fresh ingredient and high quality meat since this sandwich be explode with flavor
-PRON- do not think the sandwich be too dry without the mayo but for the second half -PRON- try -PRON- with -PRON-
the mayo be delicious as well this come from someone who usually hat mayo
-PRON- put a bunch of herb in -PRON- most notably basil which go incredibly well with the rest of the sandwich
the fruit -PRON- get be watermelon a nice fit for a hot late spring day -PRON- be fresh juicy and tasty as most watermelon be
this place be a little on the expensive side but if -PRON- ask -PRON- -PRON- be completely worth -PRON-
-PRON- plan to go back many time and -PRON- currently have one of those buy x sandwich get 1 free card which be good
stop in for the $ 8.99 lunch buffet
-PRON- must say that -PRON- be expect more mediterranean food but this place be most certainly indian food at least from what -PRON- have
-PRON- serve fresh naan and have probably 3 chicken dish a couple of curry some pankoora and rice pudding
-PRON- do like the chicken in the really vibrantly red sauce and also the pankoora and rice pudding
everything else be pretty mediocre typical buffet quality food
for $ 9 -PRON- be definitely fill up and the place be good if -PRON- would like to try indian food in a relaxed atmosphere
otherwise -PRON- be a little let down by the kabab house not have any actual kabab
-PRON- think there would be a few other option maybe a menu or something but -PRON- guess not
oh well
-PRON- be fair 3\/5
the noodle and seafood soup taste like shit

-PRON- think this be why -PRON- be empty during lunch in a very crowded location

-PRON- would definitely go back here and here again
but just be sure be early because -PRON- be always pack full of people
third time be not a charm
when -PRON- first open -PRON- be super excited since -PRON- be so close to -PRON-
but albeit -PRON- be dissapoint
the lady at the counter be very sweet but the dish -PRON- try be either very dry or to sour
-PRON- think maybe -PRON- need time to settle and work out the kink but the 2nd and 3rd time still do not do -PRON- for -PRON-
-PRON- even mess up -PRON- stomach
maybe -PRON- be order the wrong thing
-PRON- be call salam pizza so -PRON- speciality must be pizza sigh
ok fine -PRON- have convince -PRON- to go for a 4th time
come here a second time during a weekday around 9 pm
the food come out slow
the waiter be decent
the food be just okay again
the prime rib be cook the way -PRON- want but flavor be bland
the reuben be very salty although -PRON- happily pile on a thick chunk of meat
the good thing be the chicken fry steak
-PRON- may have to get that the next time around
overall this place still get three star
the bbq here be always moist with great deep smoked flavor and the dry rub just make everything good
the rib be fall off the bone goodness mmmm
the brisket here be one of good -PRON- have taste in vegas in that -PRON- be usually dry in every other bbq restaurant -PRON- have be to but top notch 's be very moist and delicate and melt in -PRON- mouth
the bbq sauce be great as well
do not pay any attention to the actual building -PRON- -PRON- be smell like old furniture and smoke residual but the food make the trip worth while
so good

zero stars
the most disgusting chinese food -PRON- have ever have
the seaweed salad be the most horrific thing -PRON- have ever place in -PRON- mouth
-PRON- spit -PRON- out immediately
-PRON- taste as if -PRON- lick an old dead fish lay on the ocean algae ridden shore
the mongolian beef be so fatty tough greasy -PRON- be literally inedible
just sick
just say

-PRON- have refer family and friend and would recommend -PRON- without reservation
pretty standard walgreen no complaint but nothing that will set this one apart from the other good walgreens location
the staff be friendly
-PRON- get a few card a some mint for -PRON- desk at work and -PRON- be easy enough to find everything and -PRON- be all clean and organize in each aisle
overall b+ -PRON- have nothing bad to say about this location hit -PRON- up if -PRON- need something quick from a walgreens
-PRON- be actually a member here for 2 month last year
this location be locate on simmons just south of ann road
pros friendly staff -cheap membership rate $ 19.00 duh -plenty of parking -decent amount of cardio equipment for the size of the place con -too small -get crowd fast which lead to wait to use equipment -no locker room shower sauna jacuzzi pool -not nearly enough free weight all in all the people here be very nice but -PRON- be just way too small and do not offer alot of the amenity -PRON- can get at other gym for less than an extra ten buck a month
2 star
-PRON- really like the choose -PRON- own seat when -PRON- buy ticket
menu not post which be confusing as picture be online
not sure if -PRON- be go through change
-PRON- husband chair do not recline but the manager offer -PRON- a comp ticket for a future movie
nice gesture
while the wait be very long -PRON- can understand why
dr. giaccobe be awesome and willing to answer any and all question that -PRON- have
-PRON- be empathetic and very blunt which -PRON- appreciate greatly
the ultrasound equipment that be use be top notch and

additionally -PRON- really like the front desk staff -PRON- also perform check out and -PRON- keep -PRON- aware of what -PRON- co pay would be ahead of time
-PRON- would say that the only downside would be the nurse that call -PRON- back

overall -PRON- be look forward to -PRON- next visit and wish -PRON- do the actual prenatal\/delivery care instead of just side by side with -PRON- regular doctor
no doubt the food here be great
-PRON- try the pad thai and khao soi both of which be extremely flavourful and aromatic
the pad thai be stir fry in a delicious nutty and savoury sauce while the khao soi be swim in a creamy and rich curry gravy broth
-PRON- only critique be that -PRON- price point be a tad high than other downtown thai restaurant
as such the $ 15 + dish be proportionally large than a regular portion size and -PRON- find that to be a struggle for the average eater
do -PRON- force -PRON- to finish everything and suffer from heartburn
or do -PRON- pack -PRON- to go but hate -PRON- for have to lug -PRON- around with -PRON- for the rest of the day
-PRON- personally have a strong dislike for restaurant who encourage overeating by only offer large than normal portion size all in all -PRON- want to give this place a 3.5 for the food
but -PRON- will round -PRON- up since -PRON- be delight by how attentive and polite the service be
-PRON- have be to taxco several time as -PRON- work nearby
the food be very tasty and the staff be always super friendly
the food come out fast and be reasonably price especially the lunch special
why be the taro milk tea brown chalky and chocolatey
-PRON- be suppose to be purple

-PRON- agree with another review that say -PRON- feel dirty
-PRON- just do not get this place
nice employee though
-PRON- doubt -PRON- will be back
-PRON- wife 's seafood pasta special of the night be good but -PRON- bolognaise be straight out of a can and not worth eat

there be defnitely a lot of value come here

-PRON- be a married couple and ask for a room with just one bed but -PRON- get a room with two very small bed
the hotel do not have a shuttle to the airport and do not give -PRON- correct time for the public transport shuttle so in the end -PRON- have to take a cab back also to return to the airport
no one admit -PRON- be -PRON- fault for give -PRON- the wrong time
this be the first time -PRON- have have belizean cuisine
and -PRON- be sell
great food quick and polite owner
definitely come back
stew chicken entree
what can -PRON- say
there be a reason -PRON- be one of the best know restaurant in montreal and even canada
the food be fantastic particularly the duck carpaccio which be perhaps the big surprise of the night
while -PRON- expect great thing from the entree this little starter be exceptional
the main -PRON- be very good but nothing that blow either of -PRON- away
just really well execute dish that perfectly suit the chilly spring evening
-PRON- have be to quite a few anytimes around the country
and -PRON- have to say this one be the good -PRON- have be to
the owner have a put a lot of effort into make the place look clean and new
the wi fi be always work
the shower have shampoo and even mouthwash for hells sake
-PRON- do not get the same attitude as some of the other gym in north scottsdale will give -PRON-
ooo pita pit how -PRON- make -PRON- park illegally outside of -PRON- establishment for -PRON- delicious pita
cheap fast easy delicious pro hummus be yummus
grilled warm turkey on a salad make -PRON- taste more like a meal and less like rabbit food also -PRON- can have -PRON- grill -PRON- veggie for a sneaky way to get double veggie
great selection of veggie and sauces\/dressing
fast
healthy
outdoor seating
con
very limited option for a side besides chip and a cookie
no soup
no fruit
come on p pit
overall great spot for a healthy lunch in the southside
somewhere -PRON- can actually eat during the busy lunch hour without have to box out other 9 to 5er
fyi
hummus be extra but if -PRON- do not get cheese -PRON- free
love natalia for great deep tissue massage

and -PRON- come for for edc week
so -PRON- have extra day before edc
go on a friday night to see on of the djs
soo
-PRON- pre game a little then head there
so -PRON- boyfriend and -PRON- wait in line to get into the club the guy check -PRON- ticket and -PRON- be okay
-PRON- look behind -PRON- and boyfriend
seem a little slow because -PRON- have a few drink and -PRON- be tired and jet lag
and -PRON- tell the security
sorry -PRON- be have few drink and a little tipsy
the security tell -PRON- -PRON- have to step aside and out of the line
-PRON- be like no
-PRON- be not go in without -PRON-
so -PRON- try ask why can not -PRON- get in
-PRON- say to -PRON- boyfriend how many drink -PRON- have
-PRON- have 2 or 3
-PRON- still would not let -PRON- boyfriend in
-PRON- fucking pay full price for -PRON- and could not get in because
-PRON- be intoxicated
which -PRON- be not
in -PRON- head -PRON- be look around all these people be drink around -PRON- and get waste
-PRON- be vegas of or course
thought -PRON- would understand
because -PRON- be vegas
but fuck idk
waste money
the place be pack during brunch time
if -PRON- have a big party make sure someone get downstairs to wait in line first
-PRON- only have 2 people and -PRON- wait in life for about 20 minute
though -PRON- be busy the service be good and fast
-PRON- have the smoke ham and cheddar cheese omelet a fruit bowl and filet and crab cake benedict for breakfast
pricey but very tasty
good poriton sure to get -PRON- full
the lodge be a great day spot as well as if -PRON- want a casual night
-PRON- have a good out door area as well as -PRON- inside large comfy couch
-PRON- can play pool or watch a good beer here and the cheese burger and cheese curd be to die for
good all -PRON- can eat sushi around
-PRON- have unique fresh quality roll and sashimi
most all -PRON- can eat place have crappy little roll and limit how many specialty roll -PRON- can order but not this place
-PRON- also love that -PRON- include appetizer salad soup and dessert on -PRON- all -PRON- can eat menu and -PRON- can order as little or as much as -PRON- want
this allow -PRON- to try a variety of different thing without overindulge and for a great price
the only reason -PRON- can not give -PRON- 5 star be because the service can be quite slow when -PRON- be busy and -PRON- may forget to bring out part of -PRON- order all together
however -PRON- do somewhat make up for this by allow -PRON- to order as many round of food as -PRON- want
fun board game and good mango milk tea
-PRON- roomie and -PRON- just move into -PRON- apartment a few week ago and see this place
the name be super catchy so -PRON- decide to give -PRON- a try
-PRON- be amazing
in a city like phoenix where people hangout in -PRON- backyard instead of front porch -PRON- be refreshing to find a wine\/beer bar that encourage community
-PRON- have never be there and not meet a new friend from the neighborhood
the bartender be hilarious and can always peg exactly what wine
-PRON- be in the mood for
overall -PRON- absolutely love -PRON-
-PRON- recommend -PRON- to anyone and everyone who enjoy wine or beer or community or all three
seriously the good discovery make since live in uptown
a couple of month ago -PRON- husband and -PRON- begin -PRON- search to find the perfect wood look tile and bathroom tile to install in -PRON- home
-PRON- go on yelp and find that affordable flooring and more have exceptional review so -PRON- decide to give -PRON- a try first
when -PRON- get to -PRON- store right away -PRON- be warmly greet by lisa who show -PRON- the many different wood look tile and other tile option -PRON- have
-PRON- be able to pick out a few tile that -PRON- like and base on the rough measurement -PRON- have of -PRON- home quickly receive an estimate
after leave -PRON- store -PRON- go to home depot and lowe 's to check -PRON- -PRON- selection
however even though -PRON- have a few different tile option the customer service at each store be non existent
-PRON- husband and -PRON- quickly decide that if -PRON- be go to spend quite a bit of money on new floor -PRON- want to go with a place that have great customer service and would actually be attentive to -PRON- need and question
-PRON- also really like the idea of go with a small local business
-PRON- return a couple of more time to affordable flooring to make sure -PRON- pick out just the right color tile
lisa travis and gomez be always more than helpful each time -PRON- visit
once -PRON- confirm the tile that -PRON- like -PRON- choose marazzi harmony pitch wood look tile and mohawk viella cafe creme for the bathroom gomez come out to -PRON- house to measure and by the end of the day -PRON- receive an accurate write estimate from travis about the total inclusive cost of -PRON- project
the installation process be so much easy than -PRON- expect
each day 2 or 3 crew member come and work
-PRON- be very professional and kind and be always quick to answer any question that -PRON- have about the process -PRON- can not say enough good thing about gonzalo adolfo and junior
also at the end of each day eddie another employee would call -PRON- to tell -PRON- what the crew finish and what would be happen the next day
have those update make -PRON- feel that -PRON- truly care about -PRON- customer
all in all -PRON- be a great experience work with each member of the affordable flooring team
-PRON- floor look fantastic and -PRON- could not be happy with the result
-PRON- highly recommend -PRON-
finally stop at this place on a tuesday at lunch time
cashier short guy with pony tail rude and grumpy
-PRON- order a cowboy cookie and an espresso shake
the cookie be amazing
lot of oats and incredibly delicious
the shake be yummm too but so rich -PRON- could not finish -PRON-
the other 2 employee -PRON- encounter be nice just that one be have a bad day perhaps
-PRON- be busy but there be plenty of seating
will return for more cookie in the future
terrible terrible service the so call manager and -PRON- girlfriend have the nasty attitude
the online ordering system be simple but -PRON- seem to screw -PRON- up in store 60 of the time
like tell -PRON- -PRON- never receive -PRON- order until -PRON- show -PRON- confirmation then all of the sudden -PRON- receive the order
but -PRON- be unclear
-PRON- have spend a lot of money here because -PRON- like the good
but these bimbo just lose -PRON- business for good
the hotel be great
-PRON- let -PRON- check in very early morning and also give -PRON- a late checkout time
the room be perfect pretty comfortable etc
the casino suck
-PRON- do not think -PRON- be pay anything out
-PRON- mostly gamble there slot because -PRON- husband be on crutch so -PRON- do not go far
-PRON- have actually never experience 3 straight day of lose like that
at no point be -PRON- ever up from where -PRON- start
or even close to where -PRON- start actually
-PRON- lose the entire time
the pool be beautiful a small machine make margarita cost $ 18 which -PRON- think be ridiculous but that be vegas anymore
for the price though -PRON- be very pleased with -PRON- room and the people work there be all nice and helpful
great breakfast sandwich here call the five spot
and yes -PRON- hit the spot
come in around 11 a.m. with one of -PRON- frat bros
-PRON- look busy but -PRON- be greet and seat right away
friendly staff
also recommend the honey lemonade but head up -PRON- do not do free refill
just go to say hat be off too jd last night the place be pack
-PRON- be alone at the bar for the whole place and -PRON- rocked
good job jd
la plus grande superficie de cette boutique est occupé par des horloge à pendule do not les prix affiché atteignent facilement les millier de dollar
je pense que la dernière fois que
j'en avais vu autant c'étais
en suisse ou en allemagne puisque je
n'ai pas l'habitude de fréquenter ce genre d'endroit
c' peut être ce que
ce sont dit les propriétaire de cette boutique qui ont élargie le concept à une variété de produit suisse incluant bien entendu les chocolat
ils en ont une bonne sélection mai ce qui retien l'attention c' la cinquantaine de saveur de chocolats chaud et de milkshake qui peuvent vous régaler ici
une boutique a découvrir
-PRON- get an awesome deal here on a bedroom set but when -PRON- have pick up all of -PRON- furniture from -PRON- warehouse -PRON- be all in box -PRON- get home and open everything up
the wide and tall dresser both have chip on -PRON- at the bottom and the footboard be crack and the white leather on the headboard be dirty
-PRON- load everything up for -PRON- and -PRON- would not unload everything not carefully and do this because then -PRON- would have just waste -PRON- gas and time common sense
so -PRON- call and tell -PRON- -PRON- do not really seem to care and ask -PRON- why -PRON- do not check everything and take everything out of the box before -PRON- leave the warehouse which be dumb because then nothing would have be protect on the drive home
and -PRON- would not bring -PRON- new furniture without charge -PRON- for the trip yet -PRON- waste -PRON- gas and time to bring home chip and crack furniture which be not -PRON- fault
-PRON- be pregnant and -PRON- fiancé work 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. and only have 1 day off a week sunday 's
so -PRON- be an inconvenience for -PRON- to load everything back up after -PRON- be already out of the box and drive all the way over there to get new furniture
-PRON- be just very inconvenient and -PRON- do not really seem to care
every time -PRON- try to call and talk to someone -PRON- be not friendly at all and make -PRON- a big deal to talk to a manager which -PRON- could never get ahold of
-PRON- have to sit next to some nasty customer that complain about everything
-PRON- be look for a free meal
-PRON- wish the restaurant would have just let -PRON- leave
-PRON- issue be that the sushi be too expensive
do -PRON- not see the price on the menu
-PRON- opinion of the food be fairly good
-PRON- order the yellowtail appetizer and -PRON- be great but the slice of the fish be too big
-PRON- order the bento box for dinner
everything be good except -PRON- sub the french fire for friend pickle
the fry pickle be too think
-PRON- need to slice the pickle thin
-PRON- would visit again
this place be real good for feed -PRON- wife before a movie
-PRON- be way cheap than most of the other restaurant around the area and -PRON- be pretty healthy so -PRON- wife will not get a pot belly
win win in -PRON- book
also -PRON- can probably sneak a pita into the movie if -PRON- be short on time
this be a lot good than eat a whole bunch of popcorn
-PRON- love bao shin
of all the hakka restaurants in mississauga this will always be -PRON- favourite
nothing can compare
-PRON- use -PRON- for -PRON- wedding
the portion be huge

the vegan dog be shockingly good
-PRON- have -PRON- with at least 4 delicious topping
love the garbanzo chili and the pickle topping
-PRON- be a delightfully divey spot with a very good thing go
excellent beer selection with plenty of local brew on tap
the service be fast friendly and helpful
fry with a gazillion dipping sauce be a must
the momocho sauce bring the heat
great spot for kid and hipster and hungry peep from all walk
the italian beef be not italian beef
-PRON- notice the beef be pull from the fridge and reheat on the grill
do not even notice if there be any juice to be have on -PRON- sandwich certainly do not appear to be any
-PRON- decide to forgo the mozzarella who get that in chitown and that should have be -PRON- first sign that eat here be go to be nothing but a pass fancy
-PRON- need to kick -PRON- up a notch so after some discussion the giardiniera be say to be mild not hot so -PRON- add jalapeno
thank god -PRON- do because the giardiniera be not even giardiniera
-PRON- be cut up bell pepper with a bit of carrot throw in
where be the oil or the pepper -PRON- ask
-PRON- have no idea
-PRON- be not here
for all those who be rave about the fries- frozen shoe string fry be not the pinnacle of fry for -PRON- by a long shot
if -PRON- be the same avoid this place
there be one golden thread here- -PRON- have free tea and coffee for customer
that be a nice change from the $ 1.50-$3.00 other place charge for heat up some water and put a grocery store tea bag in -PRON-
so kudo on the free tea
-PRON- wish the food have be worth a second visit
wow what a gem
if -PRON- like fill in -PRON- cupcake this be the place
love especially the maple bacon and the banana
great scott 's feel like a hidden treasure
-PRON- really want to give this place 5 star but have to agree with the other reviewer re the owner 's manner
go there skinny come out gain 25 pond heavy great food i would recommend everyone if -PRON- have nit be there -PRON- miss out on life
what happen
this place use to be so good
now -PRON- be not really worth go all the way to the plateau for -PRON-
ever since the fire the taste and quality have go downhill
there be 2 sauce now that do not taste anywhere near as good as the old sauce
also -PRON- have change the fry -PRON- be more like mccain super fry now
not great and there be very little seasoning on -PRON- as there be before
sunday be hung over need to eat like now
the kid want bagel and this be the closet place
-PRON- have be here year ago and be surprised to see -PRON- be still there
the place be not too busy there be seat available
the staff be rude shelby the manager although cute could care less about take -PRON- order
-PRON- have press issue and have to explain how to mop or sweep or what ever the other dude be do
-PRON- obviously should have wait until -PRON- be do
lol
the bagel be squish flat like a pancake although good flavor the thing look like crap
the hot choc be 700 degree and -PRON- know -PRON- be for a kid
-PRON- be watery until -PRON- realize -PRON- be because the choc syrup be pool in the bottom of the cup
the frapachino thing be too sweet for a 13 year old to eat
-PRON- toss over 1\/2 of -PRON-
the dr pepper be good

the pandesal bread 's be good but if u do not eat -PRON- other stuff right away like this cassava cake -PRON- buy a day ago u may find -PRON- w\/ a mold dessert
the 1st day -PRON- get -PRON- try -PRON-
-PRON- think -PRON- taste ok
nothing special like -PRON- mom 's or aunt homemade one
-PRON- be go to eat -PRON- the next day cuz -PRON- hate to waste but then -PRON- get mold
probably a good thing for -PRON-
save -PRON- from eat something that be not all that good
-PRON- do not think -PRON- sweet rice cake be all that either
on one of the review -PRON- read about this bakery -PRON- say something about the turon be good in which -PRON- agree
the staff seem friendly helpful but -PRON- just be not satisfied w\/ the taste texture of -PRON- dessert
maybe because -PRON- be filipina
-PRON- live there for a couple year when -PRON- dad be station in clark air force base so when -PRON- come to filipino food
-PRON- be hard to please
end up here by mistake as sparrow do not open until 10 a.m. for breakfast
-PRON- cross -PRON- finger that perhaps -PRON- may be a little gem find and -PRON- be
not overly expensive super enjoy -PRON- breakfast sandwich
latte be great and the fresh juice free with check in be always a great treat
service be great though there do seem to be lot of staff move about
-PRON- hope that -PRON- have a rush to account for the staff number
amazing place energy and even smell good
lomi lomi amazing and mysti amazing therapist
service be terrible the waitress only check on -PRON- once during the entire meal and -PRON- wait 20min after -PRON- be do with the meal for -PRON- to come back and -PRON- do not even plan on come back if -PRON- do not wave at -PRON-
-PRON- have a fantastic time at marquee for -PRON- bachelorette party

-PRON- highly recommend
kelly have be -PRON- go to mechanic since -PRON- mobile day 13 year ago so of course when -PRON- car begin give -PRON- trouble -PRON- rip -PRON- place apart search for -PRON- business card
2 hour later -PRON- find -PRON- cue angel sing

upon walk in -PRON- be greet by kelly and -PRON- business partner james the other mechanic marshall be not in this day
kelly be awesome as usual both -PRON- and james go over -PRON- entire car and tell -PRON- what -PRON- current issue be and what be go to be an issue later
there be no rush to get anything do right then and there
but here -PRON- sit a week later at the shop replace -PRON- alternator
-PRON- trust -PRON- not to have -PRON- spend unnecessary money on thing -PRON- do not need
lady this be -PRON- kind of shop clean and tidy comfortable seating area with a television and hot coffee brewing
and for the encore the restroom will not leave -PRON- suffer from medical condition later in life due to hold -PRON- for fear of the restroom be use as a storage locker for dead body and rust car part -PRON- be well lit and clean have -PRON- not be for the mechanic shirt hang in there
-PRON- would not know man actually keep the place up
-PRON- have include photo to prove -PRON- point
seriously if -PRON- be look for honest knowledgeable mechanic that will not give -PRON- the run around or leave -PRON- feel like -PRON- have be have go see these guy -PRON- will not regret -PRON-
-PRON- have hear -PRON- be open on some holiday to accommodate schedule
so here be the thing
-PRON- actually come here quite regularly
food be very good but service be just as important
if -PRON- order a dish -PRON- will ask -PRON- how spicy -PRON- would like -PRON- mild medium or hot
no charge for choose more and no discount for choose less
today -PRON- choose medium
but when -PRON- open the box -PRON- be less than -PRON- have want
no issue -PRON- think so -PRON- send -PRON- son to get some extra hot sauce from the guy
-PRON- say -PRON- need to pay an extra 50 cent so -PRON- come back
-PRON- then go back because -PRON- be surprised
the person behind the counter confirm the same
-PRON- say -PRON- guy do not charge for sauce upfront and if the customer want a bit more what be the issue
-PRON- understand but say -PRON- be a management decision
odd to be nickel and dim customer like this
recommendation management owner
should listen to the guy behind the counter
-PRON- be great and know -PRON- customer solicit -PRON- input before roll out these odd nickel and dim policy
one of -PRON- favourite place in scarborough
the customer service and decor be excellent and who can complain about ayce meat
definitely recommend this place
be warn gratuity be include in the bill
reuben 's have become over the year one of -PRON- favorite breakfast stop in montreal for a st. viature bagel creme cheese lox red onion cucumber tomato and caper
something about the bagel and especially the lox -PRON- do not seem to have the same salmon quality here in the state
-PRON- have have lunch and dinner there as well the service be always good as be the food quality the price be very reasonable
-PRON- do not believe -PRON- can good wrong stopping in for a nosh when visit montreal
-PRON- have be go to la femme nails since -PRON- move to the las vegas\/henderson area a year ago
-PRON- yelp and this place be fairly close to -PRON- house and have good review
everyone seem pretty good there but -PRON- have kay the first time
and -PRON- be very good very friendly
the second time -PRON- come -PRON- be with nancy and -PRON- be so sweet so helpful and accommodate and really be a perfectionist
-PRON- gel manicure be fantastic and -PRON- pedicure omg
-PRON- deep foot massage be the good part
la femme be a good place to relax and pamper -PRON-
-PRON- recently add a ton of new and fun color to -PRON- already large gel polish selection
opi essie gelish gelcolor gelaxy etc
a regular gel manicure be $ 30 if -PRON- get lot of design chevron aztec polka dot crystal or metal stud etc
-PRON- be $ 35
pedicure start off at $ 25 and go up with the different selection available
go and pamper -PRON- already
this place be nice at first but when -PRON- come to pay -PRON- pay and tip 25 and -PRON- be still not happy
so -PRON- tip 25 more and -PRON- be still beg for more
not sure what kind of scam this place be please be aware
-PRON- will not be back to this place
not nice if -PRON- do not tip 75 or more
-PRON- have be to several good chicago type place like this and this one just do not make the grade for -PRON-
italian beef be -PRON- sandwich of choice in this setting so that be what -PRON- pick
the sandwich be pretty good sized so that be one positive
however the meat just do not have any flavor to -PRON- and the onion seem to have be cook to death to the point where -PRON- be just stringy piece of nothing
the fry be not bad but -PRON- could have use some seasoning or maybe a little more time in the frier
-PRON- think -PRON- will continue -PRON- search for good italian beef in the area
so good
get piña colada watermelon or coconut with sweet milk!!!:)
the people that work there be so kind
vine expressions be a local haunt in the heart of gilbert
-PRON- have a confortable environment friendly and knowledgeble staff and some really good wine at a reasonable price
-PRON- would not consider this to be the bad place in the world but -PRON- be the project of green valley
for the most part the rule be the rule and -PRON- be explain to -PRON- at the time when -PRON- move in
so no surprise yet
but -PRON- be very slow to respond to maintenance request
-PRON- window have be break since -PRON- move in and -PRON- be almost like -PRON- refuse to fix -PRON-
every month -PRON- call and -PRON- tell -PRON- the same thing
-PRON- say -PRON- be fix
and -PRON- response well -PRON- be tell -PRON- be not again
for a short period -PRON- have lizard most likely and chameleon outside of -PRON- house but only 1 get into -PRON- apartment
-PRON- take two week to get -PRON- to spray
which be scary bc
-PRON- hate thing that crawl around
-PRON- also read the other review before move in and think -PRON- would move in anyway
-PRON- can not be that serious
until -PRON- see -PRON- apt
-PRON- be half the size of the display
be careful despite all of the above the big problem -PRON- have with gvcc be there dishonesty
-PRON- agree to a 13 month lease however after look into the actual month and count -PRON- -PRON- end up be 14 month
and -PRON- say -PRON- simply could not do anything
-PRON- be the way -PRON- computer work
over all -PRON- would not recommend this place anybody but college student or cheap people because -PRON- pay for a service that be not be give
if -PRON- water bath do not work -PRON- need -PRON- fix right now not next week
-PRON- daughter visit this location early last fall for a case of strep throat
the wait be not long and the physician 's assistant be helpful
the problem lie with the desk receptionist
because -PRON- daughter have no insurance at the time the receptionist ask if -PRON- would like to sign up for nextcare
advantage to cover -PRON- for future visit
-PRON- daughter respond that -PRON- would begin health coverage in january through the affordable care act marketplace
the receptionist respond that -PRON- daughter should then sign up for nextcare 's three month rather than annual plan indicate that the three month would cover -PRON- until the end of 2013
-PRON- daughter say yes sign the form and pay the full three month in advance
imagine -PRON- surprise when -PRON- learn in january that nextcare use -PRON- debit information to begin monthly billing for 2014
-PRON- call nextcare corporate and be tell that the fine print state -PRON- have the right to continue bill unless the consumer call to cancel after the initial three month
-PRON- daughter emphasize that the receptionist have give -PRON- a choice between a 3-month and 12-month plan
when -PRON- daughter state -PRON- would be start regular health insurance in january the receptionist say ok so -PRON- just want the three month plan
when -PRON- daughter call corporate -PRON- refuse to credit back the additional charge for january
so patient use nextcare need to read the fine print even if -PRON- be so sick -PRON- just want to get home and not read anything
the process clearly be misrepresent
the receptionist never say that -PRON- need to call to cancel after three month
-PRON- be not sure if the receptionist -PRON- be unaware that this be the case or if trainee be instruct by corporate not to disclose verbally what be in the fine print
although the january charge only cost -PRON- daughter an extra $ 30 or so -PRON- be the principle
just think how much extra revenue corporate nextcare would take in if this happen to thousand of people across the country
this review be for the bar only -PRON- be -PRON- go to place to unwind on any give night
tonight happen to be a rare friday evening where -PRON- fiance and -PRON- be ready to get -PRON- swig on
royal palm bar take good care of -PRON- fantastic bartender fun company on either side of -PRON- great wine delicious food especially the bread with pesto sauce and dwight on the piano with a vocalist
jared have a simple turkey sandwich with some sort of salami and a side of salad
-PRON- go with the bronzini fish that be serve with some vegetable different than what -PRON- expect but very good
in the past -PRON- have go with -PRON- burger and -PRON- be ahhhmaz
one of these day -PRON- will actually spend the night at the royal palms but until then -PRON- be a treat to just go for several drink a meal a cup of coffee and a slow drive home
do not take anything here to be pawn
-PRON- can never get the information -PRON- need from -PRON-
-PRON- always spout off about the law and not be able to release information yet -PRON- give -PRON- courtesy call tell -PRON- the same info -PRON- need when -PRON- call
-PRON- have not get a reminder notice in what seem like a while
and all -PRON- want to know be if the payment be due or if -PRON- miss -PRON- while -PRON- be deal with be in a bad accident
go to go tomorrow and hope -PRON- item be still there
then get -PRON- the hell out and take -PRON- somewhere else where the people do not jerk -PRON- around
-PRON- be update this again
maybe -PRON- be crazy
crazy in love that be
yesterday -PRON- skip lunch and decide to drop in to try the new summer salad on the menu strawberry and gorgonzola
-PRON- be delicious and very good sized
-PRON- would have share the 1\/2 salad if -PRON- have be plan on order a pizza later
the really great part though come when -PRON- get the bill
the salad be 5.95 normally but -PRON- be discount 25 along with all the rest of the food on the menu during happy hour 3 6 mon fri
-PRON- leave a ten dollar bill for the salad and an ice cold stella w\/ tax and tip
-PRON- sit at the bar and have no problem with service of course -PRON- be not very full at 4:30 in the afternoon
anyway -PRON- do not think this place deserve the hate
check -PRON- out and eat the pepperoni -PRON- be the good
great place
a bit on the high end side of thing
but -PRON- be the experience
one reviewer say -PRON- 2 party bill be $ 160 and -PRON- leave hungry
ok people -PRON- be in a party of 3 and -PRON- be full for $ 133
-PRON- see the menu -PRON- know what -PRON- hope to get for the price ambience and food wise
so for what -PRON- be -PRON- enjoy -PRON-
-PRON- give the restaurant 3 star 1 star for food 5 star for service
the meatloaf be dry tasteless -PRON- wife 's fry chicken would have be good if -PRON- have buy -PRON- from kfc
-PRON- be not sure why the chief combine food that do not make sense eg sweet pot w\/apple lamb chop w\/quinoa both protein
the waiter do not know the beer that be available state -PRON- have no beer on tap so -PRON- ask for list no price no description when waiter bring -PRON- choice which turn out to be a beer on tap
another waiter drop about 5 plat dish right in front of -PRON-
amazing amazing amazing
food be delicious
-PRON- server renee be incredible
everyone be very engaging funny and just all around great people
the food
currently in a food coma
first -PRON- start with the salad bar which have a variety of salad veggie and even a meat and cheese board
everything have so much flavor and be very fresh
then -PRON- give the green light to start come over with the meat
everything be perfectly cook have great flavor
then -PRON- need -PRON- with -PRON- molten lava cake
delicious
be a steakhouse -PRON- be expensive but worth every penny
-PRON- get the whole package

and
neither be very good
second time go with signature recommendation white pizza and meatball pizza these be awesome
-PRON- be still work out the kink since opening but this place be a much welcome addition to the neighborhood
this be an upscale version of a sushi restaurant with no all -PRON- can eat just a la carte
-PRON- mixed drink and cocktail be delicious try the sapporo mojito and -PRON- have daily food special like oyster on wednesday
the sashimi be fresh and delicious and -PRON- roll be really tasty
-PRON- only gripe be there be no handroll on the menu even though -PRON- be post on the window and there be no sushi sashimi combination together
why not
there be only sashimi combo and none come with rice
-PRON- have be here twice since opening
and -PRON- have a good time each time
-PRON- will be back for sure for oyster night
le resto est toujour plein et ca se comprend
j'ai goûté aux nachos
une assiette généreuse je vous recommande la demi portion
un choix de bière assez intéressant
le service est rapide pour un restaurant rempli
les prix sont raisonnable
la déco est franchement intéressante
on retrouve de tiroir où les gen laissent des papier
ca donne des sujet de conversation intéressant
bref j'y retourne
very good result
this be -PRON- 3rd trip to brazil and by far the good
a brazilian wax by nature be not an enjoyable experience but leslee with -PRON- warm personality and great technique make -PRON- bearable
-PRON- room be cute cozy too
although the salon be a bit of a drive for -PRON- -PRON- will definitely return
base on other reviewer experience -PRON- want to try a facial next
a nice solid option
-PRON- have be at this popeye 's twice and -PRON- be all good
last time -PRON- be there
-PRON- order the 8 piece family pack which include 8 piece of chicken a side fry and 4 biscuit
the person at the counter get -PRON- right when -PRON- dictate 5 piece spicy and the two thigh and one breast not spicy
that be $ 17.99 with tax to feed three people
since this be the first week that -PRON- have be open there a few kink to workout
the restroom have a key that -PRON- have to keep track of -PRON- guess -PRON- can not lock the door from the inside
plus the loudspeaker where -PRON- call -PRON- name when -PRON- order be ready be garble and really annoying to listen to
all the food be delicious
the biscuit be the highlight for -PRON- -PRON- be perfect
-PRON- have be to other popeye 's that either put too much butter or some other ingredient in the biscuit so great job
popeye 's -PRON- be about time that -PRON- have come to the east valley
remind -PRON- of the local coffee shop in brooklyn ny but a lot more spacious
the staff here be so friendly and the coffee be make strong just how -PRON- like -PRON-
-PRON- love that -PRON- have the option of coconut milk and plenty of yummy vegan bake good
perfect spot for a weekend or weekday coffee date
much rather give -PRON- money to a local spot than starbucks -PRON- will absolutely be a frequent visitor at brakeman 's
wife place order for dinner for grandkid as -PRON- give -PRON- az cardnials ticket to daughter son in law
wife call to check on order after -PRON- be 15 minute late
-PRON- be tell order go out door as -PRON- speak
after another 15 20 minute -PRON- call again and this time be tell remake -PRON- order as -PRON- be give to another customer
finally show up over hour late with nothing but a weak apology
piss poor customer service if -PRON- ask -PRON-
would highly recommend this company
tommy be prompt courteous wear bootie inside the house and always do a fantastic job
-PRON- schedule -PRON- in quickly and -PRON- chemical work great
thank crosshair
-PRON- have be come here for a while now and after today -PRON- see -PRON- slip in service and food
-PRON- hope -PRON- be not because -PRON- really like this place
not a bad hotel option if -PRON- be on a budget but not as luxurious\/new as the other hotel in las vegas can not complain since staff be nice be helpful w\/ -PRON- complicated room situation
-PRON- go to diamond member check in even though -PRON- be not member
and -PRON- still help -PRON- out
so great in a stressful time do not have a pool open during -PRON- stay
that be kind of lame
-PRON- think -PRON- be temporary note -PRON- be connect to the paris hotel
-PRON- be always fine at hard rock
the staff be great and the food be tasty
lot of good music and video to enjoy while enjoy -PRON- meal
-PRON- both have great burger and the fry be very well season
also -PRON- drink never run out before -PRON- have more in front of -PRON-
what a find
in from out of town and yelp do not disappoint here great food and music
wait ten minute
a server do not even come over
wait
-PRON- take that back server come over and ask if -PRON- a two adult one child table be together with a six top
-PRON- say no
-PRON- be go right to -PRON- table
-PRON- sit before that other table and -PRON- get -PRON- order take and drink before -PRON- be able to
-PRON- look up and see four people stand around the bar talk and laugh too
people that work there word of advice
do not ignore -PRON- table
-PRON- be out to spend money
-PRON- guess -PRON- do not want -PRON- money
terrible service
only second d time visit and -PRON- live two minute away
-PRON- be lose -PRON- local demographic by give this kind of service
to the manager that be stand right with -PRON- worker laugh and carry on -PRON- never say a word to a single table while -PRON- be there
-PRON- situation -PRON- be a male who typically sport trendy and unique hairstyle faux hawk pompadour and the occasional fashion mullet
trouble be find a stylist that understand and be comfortable with execute the aforementioned edgier hair style be no simple task especially in charlotte
and now enter kate at salon m2
kate be a god send and that be come from a non religious person
-PRON- get -PRON- style and expectation and -PRON- be a pro at execute -PRON- particular vision for whatev hairstyle -PRON- want
specifically -PRON- can tell -PRON- enjoy what -PRON- do and the passion be definitely there and -PRON- see -PRON- translate into the end result
-PRON- have even tell -PRON- let -PRON- try something new do what -PRON- want
so to those read this -PRON- do a exceptional job
bottom line
like other reviewer for salon m2 -PRON- believe every aspect of the salon be highly professional from the receptionist ambiance customer service and pricing and so on
but what -PRON- care about most be how -PRON- hair look at the end of the day and kate always deliver
-PRON- eat at the boiling crab last night
-PRON- have a 3 lb lobster and 2 lb of shrimp
-PRON- cook -PRON- in a bag with potato and corn
no silverware so -PRON- eat louisiana style
great fun
golden buddha be one of -PRON- favorite place because the food be always good and the atmosphere be really nice with a piano player
-PRON- often use a restaurant.com certificate which make -PRON- more
affordable\/
but -PRON- would definitely come here without a coupon especially if -PRON- be entertain guest
-PRON- would guess by some of the more negative review that language\/cultural difference come into play when there be a dispute of some kind
-PRON- have have no problem use restaurant.com certificate
-PRON- go on a very early afternoon lunch and the food be fabulous
-PRON- be fresh and inside be quiet of course -PRON- be the only one there but the staff be obnoxious and rude
-PRON- get snuff at when -PRON- walk in the waitress would not look at -PRON- and be slow to bring -PRON- drink
the only reason -PRON- get 4 star be because of the sushi be so good and different from what -PRON- be use to
josie be amazing
-PRON- know what -PRON- be do and -PRON- give very accurate reading
-PRON- have lose someone -PRON- love and -PRON- devastate -PRON- so much
for some reason -PRON- end up at -PRON- studio
-PRON- be able to help -PRON- find answer and be able to conver with -PRON- love one thru -PRON-
-PRON- be able to tell -PRON- what i be do at home or work because -PRON- love one tell -PRON-
-PRON- be extremely impressed
-PRON- would for sure recommend -PRON- to -PRON- friend which -PRON- already do and family
-PRON- be very approachable kind and very knowledgeable
the pancake here be divine crispy buttery edge soft and fluffy inside
-PRON- have great service and get just what -PRON- want
-PRON- do not look like much from the outside so -PRON- have yelp to thank for find this place
-PRON- have no issue whatsoever with this location
-PRON- do everything -PRON- need -PRON- to do which be just a simple oil change
-PRON- take 15 min while -PRON- sit in -PRON- car -PRON- fill tire and fluid as well
-PRON- have a $ 20 coupon and accept -PRON- great customer service throughout
-PRON- rat -PRON- a 5 because -PRON- be not pushy about other fix -PRON- may have need -PRON- make suggestion and when -PRON- tell -PRON- no -PRON- quickly go along with the process
basically a straight forward oil change nothing over the top which be exactly what -PRON- be look for
this place be great
especially in this economy
-PRON- have ton of item and keep -PRON- look wonderful for work and beyond
the reason -PRON- love this place be because -PRON- grow up shop at nordstrom 's sak 's etc
therefore -PRON- be use to excellent quality clothe shoe and accessory
but -PRON- be too frugal to spend the money -PRON- parent have to spend
therefore for year -PRON- only invest in good business clothe and hardly any play clothe
now -PRON- can afford both and help other while -PRON- be do -PRON-
-PRON- have lose weight
and -PRON- be like a kid in a candy store whenever -PRON- go in there
my whole life have improve
-PRON- hope they stay open in this location forever
-PRON- love the staff at laloux -PRON- be so friendly and helpful
the food be really lovely not large portion but sophisticated and interesting
-PRON- be a little gem that be be there a long time rightly so
all dish be delicious
-PRON- recommend the fry chicken braise beef noodle and xiaoguo rice noodle
service be fast and the waitress be super cute like intentionally super super cute
the environment be relax but the bean bag chair be sometimes annoying when -PRON- be try to focus on -PRON- meal

atmosphere friendly casual indoor and patio self seating
-PRON- order at the counter and -PRON- give -PRON- a number
-PRON- can sit inside or out side on the patio area wherever there be an open table
-PRON- put -PRON- number on the stand on the table and -PRON- bring -PRON- food out to -PRON-
maybe -PRON- just happen to be the day but the customer be also super friendly
dog friendly patio
-PRON- also notice people have -PRON- dog on the patio
one of the girl that work here go up to a table and ask if -PRON- want some dog treat for -PRON- pup

the egg be perfectly cook the potato have a great flavor -PRON- do not even use ketchup or hot sauce with -PRON- and the french toast be amazing and the strawberry be really fresh
the soy latte with caramel be awesome
-PRON- may have find -PRON- new favorite coffee place
entertaining place on the weekend enjoy the dj
however -PRON- be tricky to obtain a table that will not disappear by 11 p.m.
thankfully -PRON- be able to get a great spot to sit and have drink but because of the craziness the service be extremely slow
however -PRON- would still like to come back to try the food
be there twice for dinner and both time be good
big open room which get kind of noisy but -PRON- be a fun place
this be a chain somewhere between carabas and maggianos
-PRON- tend to get the veal piccata type of dish at italian place as a measure and the veal here be very good
the wine be reasonable waitstaff attentive food be good
-PRON- look over at -PRON- friend 's lasagna and -PRON- look gooey sloppy whatev to -PRON-
-PRON- enjoy -PRON-
the price be reasonable enough to put brio on the list for a night out during the week
dr. buch and -PRON- staff be great
-PRON- mom have be treat here for some implant
the staff be always great
dr. buch be the absolute good
-PRON- be always professional and -PRON- have great bed side manner
these day -PRON- very rare to find a dr that care about -PRON- patient and will call -PRON- self to see how -PRON- patient be do
if -PRON- ever need dental surgery -PRON- -PRON- will absolutely be use dr. busch and -PRON- staff
this place have really begin to slip in quality
this be always -PRON- favorite korean restaurant in town
the quality of the meat have really drop
-PRON- meat come out frozen and be directly put on the grill
as of right now -PRON- be overprice for the quality of food -PRON- receive
live right next door to the sit down restaurant four petit four be a takeout stand carry the low calorie meal ideal of -PRON- literal big sister
-PRON- be a bit pricey but -PRON- serve size be actually reasonable
small salad be actually quite large sandwich be about 5 long and one hander soup be serve in paper coffee cup
-PRON- can not say -PRON- honestly enjoy salad but the path often lead -PRON- here for the mexican salad on kale when -PRON- need a green reprieve from the fry brown stuff
the price be great and -PRON- be the only place to go for movie with a family if -PRON- do not want to spend $ 100
the food be also relatively cheap compare to other theater chain
-PRON- get the movie fairly quickly after -PRON- have be release so -PRON- be worth the wait to save the money
-PRON- frequent this building back when -PRON- be the winking lizard and as -PRON- live practically right around the corner -PRON- figure -PRON- only fair to give ray 's place a shot
the entire experience feel very generic and unimpressive
the beer selection be mediocre and seem a bit pricey outside of happy hour
as other have say burger and sandwich do not come with a side of fry
even the bartender be cordial but not very personable
the only true standout of the night be the wing
big meaty and cook to perfection -PRON- be the only reason -PRON- would come back to ray 's but even -PRON- can only be order by the dozen
overall a very unimpressive experience
this be a great pizza place
organic and local ingredient with wonderful owner who make -PRON- feel at home
so far -PRON- have really enjoy all the pizza -PRON- have try
the guten free pizza -PRON- daughter love
the owner really understand customer service
-PRON- also enjoy the wine list
-PRON- will back for happy hour
-PRON- be there for -PRON- birthday december 10th
and -PRON- have a ball
-PRON- be the perfect hookah lounge
-PRON- show -PRON- some california love
-PRON- will definitely go back the next time -PRON- be in las vegas
-PRON- go here in the evening look through picture on yelp
-PRON- be crave pancake and crepe and waffle and cocktail
lol
so -PRON- look like
that s what -PRON- serve
only to find out those picture be from brunch
duh
anyways -PRON- be able to get the chef to make -PRON- waffle with icecream even tho -PRON- be not on the menu
good chicken and waffle -PRON- have ever have tho
the drink be a bit meh pricey
not a bad experience
but -PRON- be seriously crowd and small
-PRON- be sit next to a couple on -PRON- second date
-PRON- know this because -PRON- be literally sit beside -PRON- and -PRON- could hear everything -PRON- be say
-PRON- def do not get lay
anyways with that be say -PRON- be not super awful because the food be good
aaron the shop owner be great
-PRON- take in some wheel that -PRON- want refurbish and powder coat on a vehicle -PRON- have recently purchase
the communication be great deal mostly through email which be awesome because -PRON- work all day also communicate through text which be super convenient
so -PRON- drop the car off and later on in the day
-PRON- get a text from aaron say that one of the wheel be bent and beyond repair
-PRON- say -PRON- do not want to continue with the powder coat in good faith with a bent wheel
really awesome that -PRON- be honest enough to let -PRON- know rather just continue with the job and -PRON- not know anything about -PRON- and drive around with a bent wheel
-PRON- put the tire back on balance -PRON- and send -PRON- on -PRON- way free of charge
great customer service -PRON- will definitely be come back when -PRON- need another set of wheel do
what a great place
-PRON- have absolutely nothing negative to say about this restaurant
from the minute -PRON- step in to when -PRON- leave everything be amazing
first -PRON- love the decor and the entire feel of the place
-PRON- be big and open and kind of like a chalet with all the wooden panelling
but -PRON- be still get an asian feel without the cramp space a definite plus
-PRON- waitress be so polite and sweet the entire time
start with roasted wheat tea and usual kimchi appetizer
although the banchan be few than other place only get kimchi cabbage and radish this be make up for by the large portion of -PRON- other food
both -PRON- dining partner and -PRON- order combo from a really visually appealing big menu
surprised to see that the price be still very much like other small korean place
-PRON- order
1 combo with half jajangmyeon black bean noodle and half champong spicy seafood soup with rice $ 8.50
both be very good portion size and for -PRON- small stomach -PRON- probably would have be full with just one of each order
but the black bean noodle be delicious cook perfectly al dente flavour be deep and complex
the spicy seafood soup although with not much seafood be also really good with a lot of different flavour and perfect level of spice
friend order 2
combo with half jajangmyeon and deep fry sweet and sour chicken $ 12.00
-PRON- try a piece of -PRON- sweet and sour chicken and -PRON- be a lot tasty than standard version
the white meat be really tender and juicy and batter be not too thick
so good
service be great and so accommodate
-PRON- have a great time here and can not wait to try the other thing on -PRON- menu
-PRON- hear -PRON- cold noodle be also good
service be always quick an friendly sometimes the line be long so -PRON- have to wait
lot of gluten free option like macaroon and ice cream
unfortunate for -PRON- thigh
the rio poker room be in need of new management to put -PRON- lightly
everyone know well manage poker room expand and earn money and respect increase player count and make more money
the dealer be the big disappointment
-PRON- would advise player seek another location because the local player at the rio do not have enough money to win anyway
-PRON- feel as though -PRON- be in a trailer park game room
believe -PRON-
-PRON- wish -PRON- be a good experience
-PRON- be the 4th time -PRON- stay there in 4 month
-PRON- do not plan on stay at the rio or play in there poker room tournament exclude of course
other table game like crap blackjack etc be very professional and knowledgable
both the venetian and bellagio be poker room to learn from
find this place remind -PRON- of an episode of how -PRON- meet -PRON- mother where marshal go in search of the ultimate burger place and could not find -PRON- again
well -PRON- find this place and fall in love with the food
one of -PRON- favorite here besides the bison burger be the bison poutine
a large helping of poutine with real cheese curd top with shave bison and carmaliz onion
when ever -PRON- go to -PRON- favorite cheese place on ronsansvale thin blue line -PRON- stop by stampede on -PRON- way home
the last time -PRON- do this -PRON- buy an extra piece of -PRON- favorite cheese scottish applewood cheddar to put on -PRON- bison burger
-PRON- be amazing
-PRON- have to try this place
sometimes -PRON- wonder if -PRON- should not promote -PRON- and keep -PRON- as -PRON- personal secret place lol
good steak -PRON- have ever have bone in filet
service be great
set odd but -PRON- work
prepare to spend
-PRON- have to try the butter cake for dessert
-PRON- be a legend
-PRON- decide to stop here today for lunch
-PRON- do not feel like go side anywhere
-PRON- just need something quick that be not between a bun
the service be quick and -PRON- food be fresh
the orange chicken be crisp vs soggy
-PRON- also give military discount as well
update -PRON- original review base on -PRON- visit last night -PRON- visit here quite often and decide to stop in last night
-PRON- be shocked to see the price on entrance increase
from 10 buck a kid to 11.99
parent use to get in free and now -PRON- charge $ 6 per additional adult
for what
to sit and watch -PRON- own child
maybe -PRON- could see a small fee of $ 3 but $ 6
-PRON- would agree with the other review
the place be often dusty and the game do not work
so -PRON- reply about a malfunction and -PRON- fix -PRON- be false
again -PRON- go there quite often and game be usually not work
-PRON- also up some of the token cost on some game
so half do not work and the one that do -PRON- charge more
last night the place close and 9 and -PRON- start vacuum around 8:35
-PRON- think that be rude to have to jump over a vacuum cord and just hear the loud noise in general

last night be -PRON- third trip there in maybe 2 month
-PRON- be local so -PRON- do not always jump at the idea of eat on the strip but this place be worth -PRON-
each time -PRON- have go the server -PRON- have be all from ireland
-PRON- love -PRON- accent and friendliness
thus far -PRON- have have the irish sausage wrap in phyllo dough as an appetizer with a spicy brown mustard

-PRON- get pack
but be a lot of fun
-PRON- have be a regular at red rock for quite some time
-PRON- absolutely love stay at -PRON- hotel and think the property be absolutely gorgeous
however -PRON- also play regularly at -PRON- casino and -PRON- will honestly say that -PRON- have be a little tight in -PRON- opinion as for like the past 10 time -PRON- have go -PRON- have not see any decent payout
a lot of people -PRON- know who be former chairman be also say the same thing
-PRON- love play there
but -PRON- feel like there be no use as the odd seem to be stack so much in favor of the house
if -PRON- see a change in payout -PRON- will come back
-PRON- be hesitant about rollover since -PRON- would really like shine coffee which be the former resident of this location
carry over quite a bit of the wonderfully cheerful and efficient staff have the same great coffee and tea and substitute great tasting doughnut for the great tasting pastry shine offer work for -PRON-
for the folk complain about the variety of doughnut please take a look at the storefront
-PRON- be tiny
how many variety do -PRON- think -PRON- can fit on -PRON- little counter
as for the people complain there be not any doughnut leave later in the day that would be because -PRON- big doughnut business be in the beginning of the day for the breakfast crowd
a couple of doughnut leave over after sit on the shelf in the display window at the end of the day
and -PRON- be not fresh
gee why could that be
how about this
show up early at rollover get a doughnut or two
-PRON- can personally recommend the chocolate frost maple glaze and maple glaze with bacon have a big cup of hot or ice coffee or tea and just relax
oh and as a seasonal fall tip try the pumpkin spice latte with a maple glaze with bacon doughnut
no need to thank -PRON-
just enjoy this perfectly decadent combination
neededan emergency fix
-PRON- say 1 hour and 1 hour
-PRON- be
best around -PRON- will recomend to everyone customer service be the good
so now -PRON- know where to go
-PRON- think -PRON- have review on this site before but -PRON- must have be on -PRON- site
like other people be say -PRON- don't stand behind -PRON- work
-PRON- door lock do not work from the beginning and -PRON- come and fix -PRON-
that last a short time and when -PRON- sell -PRON- home earlier this year -PRON- find out that the door lock be not work again
-PRON- never go through the front door so have no idea
if -PRON- be outside -PRON- could not get in but -PRON- could get out from the inside
-PRON- call -PRON- and -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- would have to pay -PRON- to come out and fix -PRON-
-PRON- will not pay -PRON- to come and fix -PRON- screw up
then -PRON- say -PRON- would discuss with the mgr and get back to -PRON-
same story
-PRON- be out of warranty 2 yrs
so -PRON- be not responsible for the door after that
-PRON- tell -PRON- that the next house -PRON- be buy -PRON- be have the same door put on -PRON- and -PRON- would have those people fix -PRON-
-PRON- do not cost -PRON- anything
about 2 month later -PRON- get a call from a person that be about 10 minute away and be head to -PRON- house to fix -PRON- for a fee and -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- be not come to my house
and -PRON- do not authorize the fix
-PRON- lose -PRON- business and everyone else -PRON- have tell about this
-PRON- be also at the home show in the spring
and -PRON- have have a big mouth
a 2 year warranty on something that expensive be ridiculous
just enough time for -PRON- to rust and fall apart
and -PRON- be not liable
like the other people say stay away
oh
and -PRON- be also tell by a former employee that -PRON- come up with a price for -PRON- door base on -PRON- possession
if -PRON- think -PRON- have money -PRON- charge more
pathetic
if -PRON- could describe -PRON- experience in one word -PRON- would be unfortunate
the pizza be bland
there be no other word for -PRON-
-PRON- taste fresh but but not very good
aside from that staff be not very warm or friendly
-PRON- be there on a monday when -PRON- have a special a large cheese pizza for $ 9.99
for whatev reason if -PRON- add topping to -PRON- -PRON- charge -PRON- the regular price plus the cost of the topping
that really do not make sense to -PRON- and leave -PRON- feeling like -PRON- overpay
-PRON- be not go to make a deal out of $ 3
but -PRON- get -PRON- out
and everyone can decide for -PRON- if that be fair or not
unfortunately the pizza just be not good enough to justify a repeat visit anyway
-PRON- have be to hearthstone three time before but -PRON- be always with a group
this time -PRON- go by -PRON- and sit at the bar where -PRON- could watch the cook do -PRON- thing
-PRON- order the baked ricotta the poach king salmon and the peanut butter lava cake
the baked ricotta be serve with truffle honey and toast point
very tasty
-PRON- do let one of the piece of bread go back
so -PRON- do not fill up with that
-PRON- be not much of a honey person but the honey on the toast and then the hot ricotta on top make for a combination that be very good
the poached salmon be excellent
perfectly cook -PRON- be a nice pink inside
the salmon sit on a bed of eggplant chick pea and herb yogurt
an excellent healthy main course
-PRON- ask -PRON- server about two possible dessert choice
-PRON- recommendation the peanut butter lava cake and -PRON- suggestion be great
the peanut butter cake be fill with wonderful butterscotch that ooze out when -PRON- break the surface
there be also some brown butter ice cream serve with the cake
the hour and a half -PRON- spend here be a lot of fun
watch the cook make pizza salad and other of hearthstone 's goody be a show in -PRON-
-PRON- get to chat with the one gentleman and -PRON- be a great place to sit
pretty average viet\/thai place on campus
the pho broth be nice and refreshing which be nice compare to other place since -PRON- be a bit too heavy
however there be an aftertaste to -PRON-
-PRON- do not really like so much
other food like fry rice and noodle dish be meh
average not what -PRON- would call mind blow
overall a convenient place to grab food if -PRON- be close to campus for ok asian food
just about as good as -PRON- get for a fun day with the little one
expansive grassy area to run around
a city playground with equipment for all age
nice little snack shop with decent food and good ice cream

weekend in this beautiful weather november be very busy
weekday be a breeze though
after see such glowing review -PRON- have no hesitation head over here for post dinner caffeination
-PRON- order a dirty chai and a skim latte
sadly the espresso be overroast and lackluster
-PRON- do not make -PRON- past the first few desperate sip
-PRON- rarely turn away espresso but even -PRON- can not stomach a burn watery latte
the chai be overly sweet and unbalanced as well
-PRON- want to like this place as -PRON- have a charming atmosphere but -PRON- do not think -PRON- will be back
this be an absolutely wonderful find
-PRON- end up in broadview heights for an event and decide to try something new for dinner
the atmosphere be cozy but nice and familiar the service be excellent and the food even better
-PRON- have a hard time decide between the hibachi and the sushi but end up get shrimp hibachi to rival all other hibachi dinner -PRON- have have
-PRON- friend get sushi that be beautifully plat and also highly rat
-PRON- be already find excuse to try -PRON- again even though -PRON- each live far from the area

-PRON- go there ahead of time to make sure -PRON- would hear the acrobat play the large string instrument in the world spread all across the hallway ceiling
just get there at least 20 minute early plenty of thing to do from check out the kà shop to be amazed by the amount of work and detail put into the costume on display play behind the scene video and hear the music play on the string instrument
also -PRON- can get drink and popcorn before the show
and meet the fantastic lucky the dragon
first impression on enter the theatre be that -PRON- enter the kà world the theatre and the stage have no define boundary stage be prolong into the theatre almost fully surround -PRON- make -PRON- part of the story
yes that be right there be a story a true and fully develop plot line
-PRON- be pretty easy to follow but open to interpretation
-PRON- be a veritable bildungsroman
the makeup costume prop and technological effect be beyond any imagination
flawless
the choreography be inspiring and intelligible for the random individual
the acrobat be unbelievable
-PRON- not only perform inconceivable act but make -PRON- seem like the most natural thing in the world
-PRON- would go again any time
and again
and again
dr. chegnini and -PRON- staff be the absolute good
-PRON- family have be go here for about 5 year now and -PRON- be very pleased

let -PRON- start by say that -PRON- have have multiple adjustment from other chiropractor in -PRON- life and dr. teames at mountain vista be completely different in a good way
-PRON- take the time to fully understand what be truly go wrong as oppose to just throw -PRON- on the table and crack -PRON- back repeatedly
-PRON- run neurologic test use -PRON- ipad and other thing to ass what be wrong then adjust -PRON- accordingly manual or with this pain free gun thingy
-PRON- totally work
-PRON- always walk out of there feel 10x good

the rest of the staff be really nice too
-PRON- highly highly recommend mountain vista and dr. teames
very clean facility and good customer service
ondrea be extremely helpful and friendly
-PRON- be a great place to bring the kid when -PRON- be sooo hot out
let -PRON- get some exercise
the trampoline be many and -PRON- also a separate area where people can use hover board for an additional cost
-PRON- think the food be really good here
-PRON- have a burger and fry and -PRON- be legit like a superior version of a mc donalds quarter pounder and fry
the server be very friendly and sociable
if i have one complaint -PRON- really loud
so -PRON- totally can not vouch for the food at this place but let -PRON- tell -PRON-
this be the place to be if -PRON- be look for some casual saturday night dance to good music while the drink be flow
-PRON- get there around 11:30ish
the bar downstairs be pretty dead at first which be perfect
that mean no line to wait for drink
-PRON- get -PRON- drink and go upstairs where everyone be hang out and dance
all of the bartender be really friendly and be pretty fast in make the drink
-PRON- also do a great job with make good drink super fast so -PRON- never have to wait too long to get serve

to all the single lady this be the place -PRON- want to be on a saturday night
the crowd be fun not rough
certainly a place -PRON- can get hit on buy a guy and score a few free drink
dandelion seem to have do a great job as a crossover day restaurant\/night bar
base on some of the other yelp review -PRON- will have to come back here sober and try the food
drive by this place numerous time and see cabby just pack the place up so think -PRON- must be good
-PRON- judge a south asian restaurant base on -PRON- biriyani and boy do this place flop hard
-PRON- biriyani be just flavor rice and literally piece of chicken bone with very little meat
-PRON- have not try the rest of -PRON- food so -PRON- can not comment on that
but damn be -PRON- disappoint
price wise this place be cheap so -PRON- can not complain about the food not the good place to sit and eat but good to do take out
-PRON- get why the cabby come here since -PRON- make the food fast and -PRON- be a quick eat
the staff be not really helpful unless -PRON- speak -PRON- language
only place that sell south asian food late into the night
so that be the only + stay away from -PRON- biriyani get the wrap -PRON- guess as the other poster have mention
excellent customer service

-PRON- be not a fan of sweet dessert but do -PRON- know the line
-PRON- have -PRON- at hello
that about sum -PRON- up
everything look so delicious -PRON- have difficulty choose just 1
finally decide on a pastry a small cup of coffee pay $ 4 for the pastry $ 3.50 for the coffee totally ridiculous for the coffee but the pastry be worth every scrumptious bite

-PRON- will spend -PRON- dollar elsewhere

-PRON- wish -PRON- would take credit card though
ambience 3.5\/5
nothing special but small and homey
price 3.5\/5
not too expensive or cheap similar to other asian join in the area
come here for the coding cafe meetup
-PRON- be a really calm atmosphere to get work do
try the mint mocha and -PRON- be fabulous
this hotel if -PRON- can call -PRON- that be a joke
-PRON- feel like -PRON- be a renovated apartment complex from the 1950 's
the hallway be like an echo chamber
-PRON- can hear people talk all the way down the hall
the door be paper thin
-PRON- hear everything outside the room
-PRON- have to walk down to the front desk to get ice because -PRON- can not call down
yes -PRON- do not have an ice machine
instead -PRON- hand -PRON- an ice bucket with a small bag of ice
on friday -PRON- have a rooftop party which be hop
but -PRON- have minimal parking
and -PRON- do not reserve this parking for pay guest of the hotel
so the parking be first come first serve and -PRON- could not give a crap if -PRON- can not park in -PRON- lot or two block away as -PRON- do
-PRON- have to go to the front desk and complain for 15 minute until the girl finally say sorry but tell -PRON- what -PRON- will take the parking charge off really -PRON- be go to get charge for parking that -PRON- do not use
seriously wtf
there be only one elevator so when this party be go good luck or take the stair
the way this place be run remind -PRON- of a hostel not a hotel
for what -PRON- be charge -PRON- be lack in huge way
management should seriously reconsider -PRON- policy and how -PRON- treat -PRON- customer
hotels.com bill this as a four star hotel not even close
what a fantastic experience
rosalynn -PRON- server be attentive and very kind -PRON- do not want for anything
jocelyn -PRON- chef be awesome
the food be outstanding
amazing food
fresh ingredient unique flavor and a menu customize weekly
tuck away from the main street in a quiet courtyard\/garden area the atmosphere and service be delightful
highly reccomend
overall food and service be good
the one star that -PRON- knock off be for the price of the food and the nickel and dim of a lot of the stuff that would normally be consider standard for -PRON-
aside from the price -PRON- order the bull dak which be label as spicy
-PRON- be spicy but not that bad for -PRON-
nothing completely outstanding to -PRON- but i get both chicken and dduk rice cake in -PRON- meal
-PRON- nibble on two piece of the spicy wing
-PRON- be good
a little dry but flavor pack a punch and be not slather on there but that could be a minus for some
-PRON- have to eat the wing with the daikon radish because korean wing be mean to be eat that way
-PRON- friend get the pork bun
-PRON- be ok
-PRON- would probably not order -PRON- again just for the fact that nothing about -PRON- make -PRON- say this be good or this be unique
quick simple dinner
expensive but -PRON- be worth a visit
-PRON- be glad to find this restaurant in toronto
-PRON- believe -PRON- be the first one in town
-PRON- be definitely worth try
seafood be super fresh and yum
-PRON- order shrimp mussel and clam
price be good
some people complain about the price
come one
-PRON- be seafood at the end of the day
love -PRON- captain 's boil sauce especially when -PRON- be slightly spicy
will come back
review by -PRON- husband vito do an amazing job and get -PRON- exactly the cut -PRON- want
-PRON- know the chance of good customer service be high when people work at an establishment be nice to each other and king 's crown certainly do not disappoint
everything from the product use and the expertise be top notch
will definitely visit again
5 star do not adequately represent how fantastic this bar be
if -PRON- could -PRON- would give -PRON- 1000
the bartender jay be super helpful and friendly -PRON- have the most phenomenal food ever see at a bar as other have say the pork roll be the bee knee and -PRON- plethora of special give -PRON- poor college wallet a breather
-PRON- be a travesty that more people do not know about this place
go there eat love and tell -PRON- friend
-PRON- will be glad -PRON- do
the food here be delicious
-PRON- be a bit different than what -PRON- be use to but still very good
there be plenty of option to choose from
although the staff be friendly the service be not top notch but -PRON- be willing to overlook that
the only real complaint -PRON- have be that -PRON- be pretty hot in there
-PRON- be summer -PRON- expect the air conditioner to be crank up a bit more
-PRON- would recommend that one never get a ground floor apartment face the pool and jacuzzi
the pool have several tv 's that be often blare day and night
-PRON- be suppose to be on a timer but at any time -PRON- can be turn back on
the pool area\/jacuzzi be open 24\/7-and lot of all night going on there
most other high end complex have pool hour usually close at 10
-PRON- also have 21 yr frat boy above -PRON- -PRON- be sure more than 2 boy be live there party and play loud music day and night
-PRON- do not get much help from staff on this
-PRON- have to call security almost every night
the apt contract which -PRON- sign clearly state that that kind of disruptive behavior be not tolerate and resident will be force to leave-- but -PRON- stay on
after a month -PRON- move to a 4th floor apt and have to pay move fee again for -PRON- furniture--
this apt face the empty lot of future ritz carleton and thing improve greatly
-PRON- recommend a 4th floor apt
with that view
the reason -PRON- be give this the 2 star though be because of the experience -PRON- have have try to get -PRON- $ 500.00 deposit back
-PRON- do not know if -PRON- experience be common
-PRON- have be try for the past almost 3 month to get -PRON- deposit check and have get the runaround from staff and corporate
excuse be let -PRON- check on -PRON- and get back to -PRON- no one have ever call -PRON- back or -PRON- will have to call corporate and -PRON- will call -PRON- back never receive an answer and oh -PRON- must have send the check to the wrong address and last from corporate -PRON- send -PRON- out monday here be the check number really
the check number do not help -PRON- one bit if -PRON- never receive -PRON-
-PRON- experience still no check
this experience show to -PRON- a lack of consideration and professionalism by this corporation and -PRON- staff
-PRON- be still wait for -PRON- check
first of all the only reason -PRON- be only give bruneaux four star be that -PRON- have only have lunch there
-PRON- will update this review once -PRON- go for dinner
-PRON- know
-PRON- previous reviewer have a bad service experience
not so with -PRON-
-PRON- find the service to be excellent perhaps err on the side of overly attentive which be not a problem for -PRON-
-PRON- have the steak sandwich serenity hills filet caramelize onion and fennel radicchio sauce top with fry jalapeño and pomegranate aril on a crusty baguette and -PRON- be absolutely delightful
the steak be well cook and the sandwich well compose
the root vegetable frite be likewise excellent
the price be very good for the quality of the food
if -PRON- have to nitpick -PRON- would be about the decor
-PRON- prefer a more dim dining environment and this place be white white white and bright bright bright
again -PRON- will reassess after -PRON- have have a dinner service
get a large rare beef special
soup be not very special and there be not a lot of beef for a large size but there be enough noodle to get -PRON- full
love these guy be here so many time
the dude be like -PRON- cousin
quick fast service up and running
do not mess around at other place just bring -PRON- home into -PRON-
amazing service and people
someone -PRON- be close to go to this place regularly but -PRON- only like one lady to do -PRON- nail
-PRON- hire a new guy recently because -PRON- know how to do gel nail and the rest of the crew refuse to learn how
-PRON- be absolutely awful
-PRON- keep file -PRON- nail so that -PRON- look like gumby head
-PRON- be all crooked and pointy and -PRON- have to take the file and do -PRON- -PRON-

go tribe
-PRON- would like to preface this review to say the food -PRON- order at this time 9:30pm-10:30pm be tasty and adequate for a wannabe upscale hk style restaurant
the porkchop french toast hk tea bbq eel batter shrimp meet the standard -PRON- expect
when -PRON- din here on a thursday the restaurant have a staff of 1 waiter 2 waitress and 3 4 table of diner who come at vary time
-PRON- mention this so reader can better rationalize -PRON- experience before excuse -PRON- service attitude due to be overwhelmed by customer
-PRON- respect and follow the etiquette and suggest guideline for tipping and never have -PRON- encounter a disappointing experience where -PRON- walk away without tip until now
the food be good and the portion be so large -PRON- have leftover but this be when -PRON- dining experience go downhill and possibly past the 9 ring of hell
the only service -PRON- have be a waiter take -PRON- order and the waiter and waitress come with the food
nothing further
nobody ask can -PRON- get -PRON- anything else
at the end of -PRON- meal -PRON- make eye contact and try to get the waiter 's attention no call button
-PRON- make eye contact but continue to serve other table amongst -PRON- a table of 10 + who have just sit down and order -PRON- drink from a waitress
after fail to get -PRON- waiter 's attention -PRON- attempt to make eye contact and wave for any of the three server attention so -PRON- could get -PRON- bill and takeout box to pack leftover
minute pass and -PRON- be so transfix with provide excellent customer service to the large table that have now order beer
-PRON- decide to go find the takeaway box on -PRON- own -PRON- be in plain view about 20 step from -PRON- table near -PRON- customer washroom
just when -PRON- grab the box -PRON- need one of the waitress approach and say in cantonese can -PRON- help -PRON- with something and not even the slight apology for have make -PRON- wait or for -PRON- preoccupation elsewhere
so in response -PRON- ask -PRON- if -PRON- can please get the bill
-PRON- return to -PRON- table the waiter approach and put down the bill
after tax -PRON- meal come to $ 37.59
implied gratuity etiquette suggest customer should give a 10 tip before tax for service render
the waiter and waitress serve -PRON- food
but -PRON- do not follow through at the end of -PRON- meal -PRON- hypothesize that be because -PRON- must have think the big table of diner could give -PRON- a big tip at the end of the night
with this lack of service admittedly -PRON- give -PRON- $ 40 cash and do not ask for change and that mean only 7 tip and not 10
the waiter stand beside -PRON- see the $ 40 cash and do not take -PRON-
-PRON- think -PRON- do not pay attention just like most of the evening
so -PRON- say take -PRON-
and -PRON- do not need change
-PRON- take the bill point at the final amount and say -PRON- can not take the money until -PRON- put down more gratuity
-PRON- immediate reaction be what and confusion
-PRON- repeat that -PRON- need to give -PRON- more tip and then -PRON- further reiterate that -PRON- need to give -PRON- more tip because the economy be bad
as if the economy be not bad for everybody
let -PRON- rephrase -PRON- do not say -PRON- want more tip because -PRON- feel -PRON- be not enough for -PRON- service -PRON- want more tip because the economy be bad
-PRON- ask -PRON- why should -PRON- tip -PRON- more for service -PRON- do not provide
why should -PRON- tip more when -PRON- have to get -PRON- own takeout box because -PRON- ignore -PRON-
-PRON- ask to see -PRON- manager because -PRON- need to understand why -PRON- be wrong
-PRON- purse -PRON- lip and wave over a waitress
expecting -PRON- to rectify the situation -PRON- also point at the bill and say that -PRON- do not tip enough because tip be suppose to be 10
-PRON- repeat there be a lack of service
and -PRON- be not ask for change
-PRON- repeat -PRON- be suppose to tip 10
suppose to
have nothing to do with service
make -PRON- decision -PRON- say -PRON- be not tip 10 and in fact -PRON- be now not tip at all and want -PRON- change back
the second waitress return with -PRON- change do not apologize and also defend that 10 be mandatory
-PRON- always tip even if the service be bad but never have -PRON- have a waiter stand around insist that -PRON- open -PRON- wallet and give -PRON- more
-PRON- have never wait table so perhaps there be a mentality to tip that -PRON- do not understand as a customer who experience really poor service
but penny pincher pound foolish -PRON- insistence on -PRON- add extra gratuity have lose 2 return diner
the economy be bad and affect -PRON- all
-PRON- make a desperate choice and give 100 customer service to a big table of diner and ignore -PRON-
base on the waiter and waitress defense for insist on a 10 gratuity without acknowledge that gratuity have a positive correlation with service -PRON- do not expect this restaurant to reflect on any of the customer review present here in order to improve -PRON- service and business management
although -PRON- be local this be -PRON- first time at stack -PRON- friend have be there before
so -PRON- have dinner prior to see a show
-PRON- be not disappoint
-PRON- appetizer be so tasty -PRON- order a second round
-PRON- have hot rocks yellowtail sashimi and ahi tuna tartare
for dinner -PRON- have the seabass with lobster risotto and -PRON- husband have the maine lobster curry
both dish be delicious
-PRON- have a bite of -PRON- friend 's petit filet and -PRON- be flavorful tender and cook perfectly
between -PRON- four -PRON- share 3 side and that be plenty
for dessert -PRON- could not pass up the warm chocolate cake jelly doughnut munchkin hole and the creme brûlée
-PRON- server trevor be attentive fun and professional
-PRON- even take a picture with -PRON-
-PRON- will definitely be back
good selection of product and tool
dreadful clueless and rude staff member get the heck over yourself
need a pick -PRON- up while visit monteal this summer
walk by and decide to try a capuccino
-PRON- be really hot out that day
and -PRON- keep toy with the idea of get some gelato
the barista overhear -PRON- and suggest that -PRON- have a toast bun with the lemon gelato inside
-PRON- be amazing -PRON- be not sure what type of bun -PRON- be
but -PRON- be flaky and buttery and mix with the lemony freshness of the gelato
-PRON- be everything -PRON- want on a hot summer day
-PRON- have have experience with acupuncture in the past
-PRON- be nothing like the care -PRON- receive from ashlee
-PRON- be compassionate and caring
most importantly -PRON- be a master of -PRON- healing art
-PRON- have be receive chemo treatment and the side effect have be horrible
one treatment with ashlee and -PRON- can tell almost immediately the difference
-PRON- can not express -PRON- enough ashlee know what -PRON- be do do -PRON- exceptionally well and care immensely about -PRON- patient
-PRON- order from thai hana use grubhub
the order come pretty quickly around 20 25 minute
-PRON- order the beef pad see ew
-PRON- be slightly on the more expensive side be $ 11.95 however the portion be very generous
-PRON- can probably last -PRON- 3 meal
the noodle be delicious
-PRON- be very flavorful and slightly sweet
there be also baby corn broccoli and carrot so -PRON- get a decent amount of vegetable
the beef be pretty tender however -PRON- be slightly on the dry side
the dish reheat pretty well but the noodle do get sticky as expect
-PRON- would suggest share with a friend
this be -PRON- go to starbucks every single day
-PRON- be so clean fast and efficient
-PRON- always place -PRON- order on the app and -PRON- drink be always ready within 2 minute
the design and seating be also very cute and -PRON- really maximize the space
be back numerous time now
still great brisket
add a great fried chicken
love -PRON-
a relatively decent option in the wynn though -PRON- be interesting to note just how many asian orient restaurant there be here now with some overlap in term of dish
service be fine though not particularly attentive
the food be of decent quality but much of -PRON- not all that different than -PRON- would get in a decent noodle place in la or sf for about 1\/6 the price
drunken noodles appear to be some form of the thai pad see ew and have decent flavor
nasi goreng be surprisingly light -PRON- order -PRON- spicy as possible which serve to prove -PRON- be on some sort of western spiciness calibration
-PRON- be somewhat spicy but not particularly so
chicken lo mein be predictable though slightly more greasy than -PRON- appreciate
three vegetarian dim sum jade dumpling palm pocket and white lotus come in a nice steamer basket stack -PRON- all have the same overly sticky wrapper in different form with different filling and together cost more than the entire dim sum meal for four -PRON- have at ping pang pong
taste be good but not particularly distinctive between the three form
dessert of ice kachang be large but disappointingly icy
-PRON- know -PRON- be a shave ice dessert but the texture leave a lot to be desire
overall not a bad choice if -PRON- be stick in the wynn and resign to pay the price but certainly not the pinnacle of asian cuisine
a hole in the wall with crazy good mac and cheese
-PRON- look like a dive bar -PRON- smell like a dive bar the bathroom be a dive bar 's the service be a dive bar the food be incredible
good drunk food -PRON- have ever have
-PRON- need to try all the mac and cheese
every day before work -PRON- find -PRON- need to go into cvs for one thing or another
-PRON- like the cashier here
-PRON- have employ a charming staff of age gentleman
who always have a something pleasant or a funny remark
this cvs be on the small side and the aisle be cramp but -PRON- have never have an issue find exactly what -PRON- be look for
even though -PRON- be a small cvs -PRON- prefer this location over the large store on fifth because -PRON- be so well acquaint with the cashier
yes -PRON- be a kardashian fan and -PRON- be -PRON- mission to come here during -PRON- last trip with -PRON- boyfriend

-PRON- security guard say that only kendall and kylie have visit the store since -PRON- open on november 1st
-PRON- boyfriend ask -PRON- if there have be any big problem
-PRON- say not really half of the customer be excited like -PRON- be
then the other half be in there say how much -PRON- hate -PRON- and -PRON- will have to tell -PRON- to leave
-PRON- guess -PRON- be do an official grand opening some time in december so all of the old kardash 's will probably be there for that
-PRON- pick up pencil and crazybandz for -PRON- daughter a postcard for -PRON- good friend and a keychain for -PRON- spend about $ 30
-PRON- will probably go back every time -PRON- visit vegas and pick up a little something
-PRON- guilty pleasure
for those of -PRON- look for a great service and result -PRON- would recommend raj
-PRON- be an amazing person and -PRON- be very professional about what -PRON- be do
if -PRON- be -PRON- first time take care of -PRON- body hair and -PRON- be kind of nervous about -PRON- -PRON- should definitely go see -PRON- because -PRON- will make sure to make -PRON- feel comfortable
the price be very good compare to all the work -PRON- do for -PRON- customer
-PRON- have never be this satisfied ever since -PRON- have find this place
-PRON- be constantly come back to take care of -PRON-
strongly recommend this place and raj
clearly renovate and work still be do perfectly locate little hotel
room be super clean staff super nice
-PRON- only disappointment be that the bar downstairs close when the music be do but hey there be plenty of option within a two block radius
would definitely stay here again
from a couple of month back
no coffee ready take quite a while because -PRON- do not have cup clean
no really
no chipotle wing because -PRON- be out of sauce
server walk off before wife could order
10 plus min to return
so -PRON- can guess how this review be go to add up
wife get angry with -PRON- because -PRON- surprise be quite audible re the cup excuse.10 15 min to locate and clean a cup but at that point -PRON- be just hop to get the meal over with
maybe -PRON- be -PRON- own fault but the service kinda change from dismissive to not quite hostile but with a degree of contempt usually find on staff at tow yard
if -PRON- have a gluten free family member -PRON- be really really hard to find place to go but
at near $ 80 bill for 3 gf pizza 1 app and no real drink -PRON- just do not have the service to cover the cost for ok pizza
really not do a food review because if -PRON- have any reason at all to eat real pizza -PRON- do not need to come here
love the variety of item good hour
but -PRON- would work on ur customer service maybe -PRON- be have a bad day
but -PRON- seem disinterested in be there and -PRON- service show -PRON-
overpriced
well -PRON- expect too much so the taste be what -PRON- assume as usual japanese dessert
and -PRON- be little bit hard to eat due to the layer
what nice guy
awesome service
-PRON- break down the cost and be far good than any locksmith -PRON- have ever use
-PRON- have a new customer for life
-PRON- have -PRON- car steal from -PRON- husband car
so -PRON- have to get -PRON- whole car rekey
-PRON- be quick and do an amazing job
-PRON- be visit from san francisco for a couple of day get a pass -PRON- think -PRON- be $ 30 35 for the week
-PRON- have everything -PRON- need even battle rope heavy bag speed bag pretty cool very clean -PRON- will use -PRON- from now on when in vegas
stop here on whim and have a great time
great atmosphere and chill people
bartender be awesome with -PRON- recommendation
will be back
this be probably -PRON- favourite pho place in toronto as -PRON- use fresh noodle and ingredient
the place seem like -PRON- have be undergo renovation recently so -PRON- look more comfy dining in
-PRON- weekend special be bun bo hue which be always -PRON- favour
but during -PRON- last visit -PRON- feel some component be miss such as coagulate pig blood and bun bo hue -PRON- still taste delicious but more of satay flavour
-PRON- do not taste much of shrimp paste in the soup as well
the pho -PRON- be still -PRON- favour in toronto the broth be light and perhaps not as flavourful as pho at thinh thanh but -PRON- use flat rice noodle unlike many other place in toronto that use dry vermicelli type
another item worth mention be pho bo kho very very flavourful and yummy
but -PRON- only serve that btw mon thu
the price be reasonable and may have to wait in the line up during weekend lunch rush but thankfully the wait time be always short due to quick turnaround time
overall a solid 4\/5
-PRON- have not have much experience with thai food
-PRON- be first expose to -PRON- at blue spice in albany ny and -PRON- be amazing
-PRON- enjoy the restaurant so much that -PRON- never have a desire to venture out and try other thai restaurant
fast forward to the fact that -PRON- be now a resident of north carolina
and -PRON- be crave thai
-PRON- find that thai emerald be pretty close to -PRON- so -PRON- head there for lunch one day
the restaurant be clean and well keep
-PRON- be immediately greet by a very friendly hostess and all the waitstaff be very friendly
while one server take -PRON- order other come by to fill water drop off food and clear the empty plate
-PRON- think most if not all of the lunch item come with a bowl of soup and a spring roll to start with
the soup be a very plain broth base soup with some egg in -PRON- and -PRON- be pretty good
with the egg and the egg flavor infuse in the broth -PRON- be a little rich but -PRON- enjoy -PRON- for the most part
the spring roll be more like a mini roll and if -PRON- do not care for social grace -PRON- could probably polish -PRON- off in one bite
the roll be nothing special and -PRON- have definitely have good roll elsewhere but -PRON- guess that be what -PRON- can expect from a free spring roll
the lunch menu which be not post on -PRON- site though the dinner menu be be basically a selection of different dish where -PRON- pay base on what kind of meat -PRON- choose or tofu\/ vegetarian if that be what -PRON- be thing be and what kind of dish -PRON- want
-PRON- seem like -PRON- have a selection of different item from -PRON- dinner menu that be offer as a small portion for lunch
-PRON- order the gaeng kua curry with pork which be a red curry with pineapple and some other veggie
-PRON- be pretty tastetacular and -PRON- love the pineapple mix with the hot spiciness of the curry
-PRON- be not too hot where -PRON- burn go down but -PRON- be spicy enough to give -PRON- snoz a small case of the run
-PRON- wife order the pad thai with the vegeterian option though -PRON- 86'd the tofu
-PRON- really enjoy -PRON- and when -PRON- snag a bite -PRON- whole heartedly agree
-PRON- also have to say that not only be the food great but the portion be huge
there be so much that -PRON- do not finish -PRON- and that rarely happen and -PRON- wife have so much leftover that there be enough for -PRON- to have lunch for two more day
if what -PRON- eat be the lunch portion -PRON- would love to see what -PRON- consider the dinner portion
all in all -PRON- be a very good thai experience
-PRON- do not want to make the same mistake -PRON- do in albany by make this -PRON- go to thai place and -PRON- definitely want to shop around to see which restaurant in the area serve up the good thai but
-PRON- know -PRON- will be come back here again at some point
wow fantastic
-PRON- be disappoint the first night when -PRON- walk in at 10:45 and be tell -PRON- be out of ice and have just have last call
the second night a different bartender eddie be very welcoming
a friend
and -PRON- enjoy the foreplay shoot for 2 a decadent mix the only thing -PRON- remember be bailey 's caramel cream serve in an edible chocolate cup
arguably the good deal on the menu
when -PRON- could not find anything else
-PRON- be eager to try eddie ask some question and come up with a drink that include mango chile infuse vodka hot hot hot and muddle strawberry and raspberry
-PRON- can not remember what else -PRON- add but -PRON- be awesome
be warn this small bar have only 6 seat and even stand probably can not handle more than 8 10
-PRON- be awesome cool and definitely a must if -PRON- be in the palms casino
-PRON- have be come to this place for 3 year each year -PRON- hold -PRON- breath that -PRON- will be as good as last year
so far so good
nothing elaborate just good basic comfort food with a friendly staff and
friendly staff
clean environment
con have to buy something to drink even if -PRON- be not thirsty
besides that great place
another ramen joint in vegas
the perfect time of the year to get nice hot bowl of noodle
talk about match make in heaven plus always enjoy check out new restaurant around the valley
guess ohjah have a bunch of restaurant each one specialize in one style or food
-PRON- never be to any of the other one
-PRON- be excited about check out one of the new one
raman be one of -PRON- favorite food
the menu be not much different then other ramen place around town -PRON- pick -PRON- style broth and then spicy level
one item that stand out for -PRON-
thankful yelp community check out the pic notice oxtail raman
-PRON- be one of there house special raman
the spicy level go mild since first time and have no idea level of hot
the medium or mild be nice subtle kick nothing major
the oxtail have mixed feeling
one piece with the bone that have hardly any meat
and -PRON- be super tough
then -PRON- have couple other piece fall off the bone just the meat and be sooo good
-PRON- be nice moist juicy and could have bowl of just oxtail
the broth have great depth and really good
the noodle be also delicious
the topping -PRON- can add more but just go with whatev come with the dish
-PRON- always tradition for -PRON- go raman style get some gyoza
-PRON- be very tasty
overall solid raman spot
-PRON- definitely up in -PRON- top five but couple of the more stable ramen spot better
the location literally almost in -PRON- backyard less then ten minute away
-PRON- have no problem come back for more then deal with long line of the more busy spot
one thing ne mention that ohjah stand out the size of the restaurant
-PRON- all associate ramen spot or least for -PRON-
not very big
ohjah be literally twice the size then any other raman spot around town
-PRON- only come for lunch so not sure the dinner crowd
-PRON- would find -PRON- hard see long waiting list like some of the small raman spot around town
the service be nothing but five star
-PRON- server be friendly explain the menu be -PRON- first time and always have smile on -PRON- face
positive vibe
the decor inside feel more like restaurant restaurant with the size lot of booth table and not forget -PRON- do have raman bar area that can watch the magic happen while -PRON- slurp down some noodle
-PRON- will be back
-PRON- be not sure if this place be call mamacita 's or mamita 's
the sign outside say mamita 's yet -PRON- could get a menu that say mamita 's or mamacita 's
no bid deal
what really matter be the food and service right
when -PRON- walk in to the restaurant -PRON- be quickly transport back to -PRON- childhood when -PRON- visit -PRON- abuela 's house
-PRON- smell like -PRON- house and be decorate just as gaudily with knick knack and other various decor
right away -PRON- could sense some authenticity
food be great
-PRON- do take longer than -PRON- be use to however -PRON- do believe cuban food that be prepare properly will inevitably take time
the waitress happily substitute the fry that come with -PRON- meal for the platano
when -PRON- get -PRON- meal -PRON- look as though -PRON- be give a whole banana
everything be cook properly and season well
the service be good
the waitress be attentive enough
if -PRON- need -PRON- -PRON- be there
-PRON- be pleasant
no complaint here
-PRON- will definitely be go back
there be a few thing that should not be in a buffet
fish for example taste horrible at a buffet
barbecued veal which sound like a bad idea already taste awful and have the texture of poorly cook octopus tentacle in a buffet
desserts that have be sit out for who know how long taste a bit like meat but not like dessert
the lamb steak be quite good though and -PRON- do like -PRON- creme brulee and -PRON- sure do know how to keep the coffee come
unfortunately -PRON- really can not say much else here except that -PRON- be convinced that -PRON- do not want to go to another las vegas buffet
after have see this restaurant on the food network and look at the review -PRON- family decide to go there when -PRON- be visit las vegas earlier this week
-PRON- arrive at 5 p.m. on monday august 20th and be greet and seat right away
-PRON- server be very attentive and come back several time during the meal to check on -PRON- and make sure -PRON- drink be full etc
so the service be great
the food eh not so great
-PRON- order the pick 3 sampler platter with fry pickle good but a little too salty smoke wing fair definitely have good elsewhere burn end flavor be good but on the dry side
-PRON- decide to order the family style dinner so that -PRON- could try a little of everything
pull pork dry flavorless brisket dry flavorless
chicken tender good baby back ribs great flavor but still on the dry side smoke sausage super spicy good flavor but again meat be dry
overall the plate of meat be lukewarm at good which would indicate that -PRON- do not slice plate everything at the same time lead item to get cold before -PRON- reach the table
the side coleslaw good cream corn(excellent bake bean super spicy
-PRON- try 3 of the bbq sauce and none of -PRON- be anything to write home about
-PRON- wish -PRON- have order individual meal and perhaps the food would have arrive hot be more moist
however -PRON- probably will never go back as there be too many other restaurant in vegas so give second shot to a restaurant be not worth another $ 100 + bill
-PRON- be pretty hard to pass up joyful house
stroll in with ricardo a for a bite to eat on a saturday night -PRON- realize quickly that no reservation be require
as soon as -PRON- walk in -PRON- be seat very quickly with menu and hot tea
at the start of the menu there be 3 dinner serving with a easy simple course if -PRON- do not want to think to hard or simply be not sure what -PRON- want
-PRON- select the number 1 serve
with soup massive plate fry rice and another plate with noodle
-PRON- can not 100 tell -PRON- what be in all the dish
but -PRON- can tell -PRON- -PRON- be pretty good with a decent serving
joyful house have a great seafood selection with a lot of live crab and lobster swim in the tank on the rear wall
although a speciality -PRON- do not get to try any
but with other yelper review -PRON- show that -PRON- maybe something worth come back to
the decor of joyful be not a 5 star restaurant that -PRON- would find in a fancy strip casino but what -PRON- do bring to the table be good food and prompt service
overall service 4 5 food 5 5 drink 4 5 seem to be a full bar
come back yes
alright fine fatburger get a slight upgrade
-PRON- never end up here on -PRON- own accord -PRON- get drag here by boy want a fatburger at midnight

-PRON- do not have to worry about be accost by dude who think -PRON- be in a rap video fyi fake bling not so cute

-PRON- do not have to worry about -PRON- burger be too pink not be able to eat -PRON-
whine whine whine
-PRON- sincerest apology
-PRON- order a veggie burger top with a fry egg bacon i've definitely have good but at least -PRON- be edible unlike -PRON- previous experience here
burger be overwhelm by topping mustard mayo pickle lettuce tomato
the steak fry fat fries be good
-PRON- will eat here if -PRON- be force but -PRON- be not go to be happy about -PRON-
pout fold arm over chest
-PRON- can not resist a new thai restaurant that come across -PRON- path
thus -PRON- have to try the new thai orchid garden that recently open a few door down from -PRON- favorite salon bella rouge
two other friend and -PRON- go to thai orchid for dinner a few night ago
-PRON- be already seat when -PRON- arrive
-PRON- park and approach the door and an old gentleman be sit out front smoke a cigarette which immediately turn -PRON- off
-PRON- start talk to -PRON- greet -PRON- and open the door to the restaurant
ahh -PRON- work there
turn out -PRON- more than work there -PRON- be the owner
-PRON- walk past -PRON- booth and sit down in the booth behind -PRON-
the smell of cigarette smoke be overwhelming
after a while the odor dissipate and -PRON- waitress take -PRON- order
-PRON- have -PRON- old standby pha nang curry with beef
cara have the pad thai and jenny have some kind of chicken and eggplant dish
-PRON- dish be wonderful
-PRON- all devour -PRON- meal and enjoy each other 's company
the only time -PRON- feel less than thrilled be once when -PRON- ask the waitress for more rice
-PRON- look at -PRON- like -PRON- be crazy but then bring more rice and when the owner come back over to -PRON- table and start pass out -PRON- business card
-PRON- be in the middle of a conversation and -PRON- have interrupt
-PRON- be just weird
will -PRON- go back
yep
the food be good
but more likely -PRON- will place an order to go when -PRON- be over at bella rouge and then enjoy -PRON- pha nang at home
this be the third pho restaurant to open up around the area
-PRON- enjoy -PRON- stay here
the renovation be do nicely and give -PRON- the thai villa type of feeling
the restaurant be clean and just the way -PRON- like
-PRON- be cozy and very small
service be polite and friendly but quite slow
have to ask for the bill 3 time before the little girl remember what -PRON- ask for
-PRON- do not blame -PRON- because -PRON- look young but at least train -PRON- more
so -PRON- can keep up with the pace
for the record that night the restaurant be not full so there should not have be any problem
the pho be not bad here bc -PRON- serve the thin noodle
the soup be pretty good and be very similar to the other one around the area
the pricing however be a little bit much
come from markham\/scarborough a small pho bowl cost about $ 5.75 6.00
a small bowl here be nearly $ 7 and a large be almost $ 8
xl be around $ 10 -PRON- believe
price to quantity -PRON- be not impressed
but the quality be there
-PRON- will be visit more to get a good sense of pricing vs quality\/quantity
3 star for now

excellent strawberry margarita
the only complaint -PRON- have be that this place be not locate in a city in which -PRON- live

-PRON- would suggest this place if -PRON- and a friend want to have a few beer -PRON- can not find elsewhere during an afternoon
would not advise for food or go there during night
good very large selection of beer have a patio on a street bad
pretty expensive for what -PRON- get beer be just slightly overprice food be overprice

service be sub par
-PRON- go there twice for completely different type of event
food and a drink on the patio service be ok could have be good
-PRON- and a friend end up get 3 small poutine to share -PRON- be ok but pricy
patio be ok turn -PRON- head a couple of time when people be honk

-PRON- end up go to the bar and order beer there
the beer be pretty expensive stella be around $ 8 9

-PRON- will definitely be repeat customer here
steamed egg goodness
any way -PRON- arrive at 11:30pm for ayce bbq
-PRON- be $ 13.99 from 11pm
-5am or -PRON- can pay full price $ 16.99 10am-11pm if -PRON- want the short rib and steamed egg after 11
-PRON- start with the short rib ribeye and marinate pork belly
right after -PRON- place -PRON- order the side come out
the tofu noddle dish and pancake be -PRON- favorite everything be great
when the meat arrive the waiter help -PRON- out by pile the ribeye all together because -PRON- cook juicier and lay out a short rib and the pork belly
-PRON- have never really work the bbq before and -PRON- must of look like -PRON- first time because -PRON- keep come back to -PRON- and move around the stuff
basically -PRON- hotter on one side of the grill than the other
the short rib be very tasty however -PRON- be try to keep some manner and not rip the meat off the bone lol
rib eye and marinate pork belly be also very good
but since -PRON- do not really move -PRON- around -PRON- kinda burn
for -PRON- second order -PRON- order brisket and pork belly
the waitress suggest the steamed egg since -PRON- be pay full price anyways
-PRON- really think
ok -PRON- will try -PRON- probably just go to be like an egg top like with some thai food
the brisket come out and be a huge serving and fresh not frozen
the pork belly be equally good and by this time -PRON- actually kinda get the hang of cooking
now for the gold medal the steamed egg come and -PRON- warn -PRON- -PRON- be go to be really hot
-PRON- probably wait 2 min
when -PRON- take -PRON- first bite
omg -PRON- have never have an egg like this before
-PRON- mean -PRON- have a whole new outlook on egg
-PRON- have come to a theory that -PRON- an egg steam with chicken stock with green onion
seriously -PRON- taste bud be dance and singing
the waitress come back to make sure everything be good and tell -PRON- to try the beef tongue and squid
but -PRON- be sooo full
after about an hour and a half -PRON- finish all the meat and some of the side
-PRON- come back with this korean drink dessert that be very very sweet
as -PRON- pay -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- only $ 4 for a pack for 50 at the asian market
-PRON- bill come to $ 36.60
totally worth -PRON-
since -PRON- do not have a lot of experience with cook korean bbq -PRON- get 5 star from -PRON- because -PRON- be extremely helpful and courteous
the service really could not have be any good
-PRON- think -PRON- be humor -PRON- while -PRON- be try to cook
but -PRON- be all in good fun
-PRON- water be always full and all the side be refill when ask
this be probably a place -PRON- will be back during -PRON- late night eating binge
this be a really nice place to hang out
there be lot of comfy place to sit and an expensive bar to spend a bunch of money at
the couch be separate enough from the dance floor that -PRON- do not feel like -PRON- have to dance if -PRON- do not want to
the lounge be very open to the rest of the casino just to remind -PRON- that -PRON- be in las vegas and to urge -PRON- to gamble more money
just take a few step outside some boundary and -PRON- can smoke because -PRON- will be on the casino floor
yay
the atmosphere be awesome and -PRON- be not that busy when -PRON- arrive
the food be alright -PRON- get the loco moco although -PRON- be a small portion -PRON- fill -PRON- up great the gravy seem store buy or freeze which be why -PRON- be give this place a 4 star review
the service however be awesome
when -PRON- come to lash -PRON- be pretty good
-PRON- original lash technician actually pull out some of -PRON- own lash when -PRON- would come in for fill but -PRON- think -PRON- be normal because -PRON- have never have -PRON- do before
when -PRON- get to have a different technician -PRON- be such a nice experience
and -PRON- would have stay with -PRON- except -PRON- leave the studio
then -PRON- start have allergic reaction evidently to the glue -PRON- be tell and have to cancel -PRON- membership
cancelling seem easy enough but here be why
-PRON- do not tell -PRON- but -PRON- have to get any credit -PRON- have on -PRON- account refund before -PRON- cancel -PRON- membership
once -PRON- cancel the membership -PRON- can not and will not give -PRON- any money back
also -PRON- keep an extra payment because -PRON- have to give -PRON- a 30 day notice even if -PRON- have allergic reaction and can no longer have the lash on
altogether -PRON- get to keep $ 100 from -PRON- for absolutely no services rendered
ich war schon einige male -PRON- be ambiente africa essen
es ist
sehr gemütlich und schön afrikanisch eingerichtet
die bedienung ist nett manchmal aber zu unsicher
das essen ist super obwohl
bei manchen gerichten da preis\/leistungsverhältnis nicht stimmt
coctails zumind der caipi ist nicht empfehlenswert
wir hatten an einem einzigen abend da glück einen super leckeren caipi gemixt zu bekomman danach leider nie wieder
und übrigen lieber barkeeper in einen caipi kommt kein mineralwasser rein
wie dem auch sei ich komme aufjedenfall wieder
denn der afrikaner ist eine schöne abwechslung zum italiener usw
achja reservieren nicht vergessen
-PRON- wife and -PRON- be look to go someplace special for -PRON- 25th wedding anniversary
-PRON- eat out often
so -PRON- plan to go to an upscale place in downtown cleveland
-PRON- wife be look online for a new place to try and -PRON- be surprised to see how high the rating be for mizestro in brecksville
this be in the same location as restaurant 21 82 but with the new owner -PRON- be a completely different experience
-PRON- be floored at the entire experience
from the drink to the service to the meal -PRON- be fine dining at -PRON- good
for example chef matt create several hand craft drink for -PRON-
one be serve in a small bottle that have the word drink -PRON- cleverly write on a tag to resemble the alice and wonderland experience however when -PRON- pour -PRON- into the martini glass over rock the color change as -PRON- pour
another drink be accompany by apple piece with cinnamon syrup salt caramel cashew powder to pair with bourbon vanilla and special bitter
-PRON- be not on the menu
chef matt just ask -PRON- a few question about what flavor -PRON- like then create -PRON-
the meal be also exceptional but rather than describe -PRON- -PRON- will post a few picture
the owner\/chef come out to meet -PRON- and -PRON- background be impressive
when -PRON- go home -PRON- google -PRON- and find the following award win chef mize a united states marine corps veteran earn -PRON- degree from the culinary institute of america cia hyde park ny while station at the pentagon in washington dc

-PRON- wife and -PRON- be town for a wedding but will definitely stop by anytime -PRON- be in town again

-PRON- meetup group come here on a saturday evening and in spite of -PRON- organizer come way ahead of time as advise so the group could secure a table -PRON- still take about an hour before -PRON- be seat
-PRON- friend and -PRON- go to the bar to get appetizer while the group wait outside
the bar atmosphere be good and -PRON- get serve right away
when -PRON- group finally get seat -PRON- still take a while before -PRON- get the food that -PRON- order
the food be good as -PRON- have expect have din in the tempe location and in this establishment 's former phoenix location
but -PRON- be surprised that there could be such a lack of coordination and organization in service consider that the restaurant have open in this location some time back
this place be utterly disturbing
the fact that -PRON- pay almost $ 7 for the beef curry with pancake roti and receive one piece of beef in a bowl small than -PRON- cup and a small piece of pancake be almost insulting
impossible to see why -PRON- pay that that much for something so little
come out for -PRON- anniversary the steak be wonderful huge cut if -PRON- want to spend money on this restaurant then this will be the place to do so
the aged steak which i order medium come out as expect
better come very hungry due to the size of the serving
-PRON- go to spot for a coffee break whenever -PRON- be in the hood
price be good compare to other place e.g. regular flat white be $ 3 with tax include compare to tan which be close to $ 4 before tax
-PRON- also have some good quick bite -PRON- recently try -PRON- portabello bahn mi sandwich $ 5
yummy and flavourful with some kind of miso base spread
-PRON- like that price include tax so -PRON- be not count change and thing be more efficient
-PRON- always play good music and barista be exceptionally friendly
get to love the name too -PRON- actually finally see a white squirrel in trinity bellwoods park this year
-PRON- do exist
yum yum and yum
-PRON- cocktail be expertly mixed and the drink menu be primarily craft cocktail
-PRON- grill meatloaf be outstanding and at -PRON- waitress urging -PRON- try the achiote squash that come with -PRON-
-PRON- be not -PRON- favorite thing ever but get -PRON- to eat squash be a monumental achievement
-PRON- be able to give -PRON- a last minute reservation which be great
the patio be adorable too
-PRON- look forward to come back
so if -PRON- like to seriously cook or bake then this be the place to go
-PRON- have all sort of professional cooking\/baking good that place like bbb will not have
like the professional bosch cooking tool mixer grinder etc
-PRON- can not say much for the place as -PRON- have only be there once to buy -PRON- mixer
however one of -PRON- friend be seriously into cooking love the place
-PRON- also have cooking class all the time
and -PRON- think a lot of -PRON- be free but be subject to availibility
walk into a small and quiet family style restaurant
the decor be kind of old and plain
-PRON- at most can sit a table for four but nothing great so big party be out of luck
there menu consist of a small variety of dish
-PRON- serve raman udon and rice and some appetizer
definitely no sushi so do not bother
service be average the waitress be nice
order the lunch special katsu curry rice
the special be a small portion from the regular main for a few dollar less -PRON- do not come with anything
the plate be pack full when -PRON- arrive
half rice half curry with fry pork
the katsu be fry really well -PRON- be crispy and the pork be tender
the curry have a little spice to -PRON- not as sweet as the normal japanese curry
that plate may not look like much
but -PRON- be extremely fill
finish about half of -PRON- and then have to get help from friend to finish the rest
overall another possible lunch place add to the list that be close to work
u be good off get pizza from 7\/11 or little ceasar 's
the pizza be sooo bad that -PRON- kill -PRON- appetite
the wing -PRON- order be fucken cold
-PRON- be freeze with a-1 sauce

-PRON- do not even have a microwave to warm -PRON- up
-PRON- be on vacation and stay in a hotel
-PRON- call the store and sam say what do -PRON- want -PRON- to do
like -PRON- be bug -PRON-
this be ur job

-PRON- be knowledgeable and actually listen to -PRON- need and want
roseanne work very hard and love what -PRON- do
-PRON- recommend -PRON- to all -PRON- family and friend
thank -PRON- roseanne
this be a panera so the food be exactly what -PRON- would expect
overstaffed for the service quality and speed as -PRON- stand here at 3:00 pm there be 8 staff on with two work
that 'd be fine if everything be clean or if the service be good
horrific bathroom
one of the stall in the man 's room have be out of order for at least six month
-PRON- feel like -PRON- step onto a set from -PRON- favorite period drama series mad men when -PRON- walk into the senator
the booth decor and even the cash register in the front still have the 1950 feel to -PRON-
this restaurant have be here since 1948 and everything be still in great condition
-PRON- din here for breakfast early in the morning and be sit right away
simple menu excellent service and quick turnaround for the food
-PRON- order the chorizo and egg and -PRON- boyfriend order the farmer 's omelet
-PRON- be a little pricey for breakfast but the quality be fresh and everything be well prepared
the senator be an awesome spot to keep in mind for breakfast especially since -PRON- be right in the dundas yonge square area
cailin be an amazing healer
-PRON- have do work on -PRON- and -PRON- not only feel completely comfortable with -PRON- -PRON- also feel so much good
-PRON- be incredibly professional relatable and all around a joy to work with
-PRON- can not wait to see -PRON- in -PRON- next appointment
if -PRON- be suffer from pain -PRON- be able to work with -PRON- intuition and vast knowledge to bring relief
-PRON- space be invite and calm which help -PRON- to relax especially when -PRON- see -PRON- for the first time
-PRON- be like -PRON- have know -PRON- for year
-PRON- can not recommend -PRON- highly enough
excellent food
great customer service
small menu selection but there be something for everyone even a kid selection
the people do not treat -PRON- bachelorette party very well
-PRON- first would not let -PRON- order from the champagne and appetizer combo menu after tell -PRON- -PRON- could over email
then -PRON- move to the dance floor around 11:30 and be move around twice as -PRON- have other reservation
by this time -PRON- have already order food for 8 people and two bottle
basically -PRON- be kick off the dance floor
when -PRON- explain this one of the waitress say -PRON- would bring over the manager and give -PRON- complementary shot but that never happen
overall a very snobby bar not at all in keep with the montreal night life culture
-PRON- end up go to another bar\/club that night
update
after -PRON- post the review the manager call -PRON- to enquire about why -PRON- have leave this review in a very aggressive tone say that -PRON- check the video camera from that night and do not see -PRON- order food that night when -PRON- definitely do
this sound quite invasive and uselessly defensive rather than enquire what could have be do to improve -PRON- experience
so -PRON- have be live here just over a month although -PRON- love the location and that -PRON- can walk everywhere -PRON- have pretty much decide already that -PRON- will not renew -PRON- lease after a year unless -PRON- move to a top floor apartment
as a bear raise new yorker who have live in an apartment for 99 of -PRON- life -PRON- be really surprised at what -PRON- have see at the broadstone especially for the money that people pay
very few landlord will have a pool party with free booze and really loud music when the majority of -PRON- resident be millennial who be inconsiderate when -PRON- come to noise level etc
with -PRON- neighbor
there have be two since -PRON- move in
apparently the rent which be high for the sq footage be because of the building 's location amenity amenity -PRON- have not be able to take advantage of on the weekend or evening basically whenever -PRON- be home because there have be loud pool party gear towards the 20-somethings in the building and crowd of people in the club room whenever -PRON- want to stop in the building be so not cater to people in -PRON- 40 up or with family who appreciate peace quiet privacy
-PRON- be hugely inconsiderate to have the music level as high as -PRON- do towards family whose apartment face the courtyard especially since there be no soundproof here
if there be someone sing on the bridge at the waterfront -PRON- can hear -PRON- in -PRON- apartment
the most annoying thing about live here be the key fob nightmare
-PRON- understand the need for security but -PRON- make no sense whatsoever that -PRON- need a key fob to get to every floor even leave the building which mean that -PRON- need to walk -PRON- guest out unless -PRON- take one elevator no lobby in the building by the way down to a particular level in the garage otherwise -PRON- need to walk -PRON- out
-PRON- make sense to need a fob to get into the building but once in -PRON- should not need one to get out also if -PRON- take the stair -PRON- do not need one at all -PRON- be guess any security threat would figure that oversight out pretty quickly
robber can use the stair
-PRON- be an absolute nightmare if -PRON- have shopping bag
the person over -PRON- have no idea that someone live underneath -PRON- as -PRON- click around in heel 50 of the time the other 50 clomp around like -PRON- weigh 400 lb why can not people walk quietly
-PRON- be hyper aware of how lightly -PRON- step to be considerate of the people under -PRON- the fact that the floor wall be thin obviously lack in any form of a sound barrier do not help
if -PRON- be think of live here -PRON- be all about location the decor in the leasing office around the pool in the club be beautifully do but there be also the follow con to consider high pricing for very small square footage -PRON- gouge -PRON- for common area utility never do in nyc consider that -PRON- already charge too much in most place the common area utility be already factor into the rent the rent be not the same amount from month to month
-incredibly difficult access for guests\/visitor when enter and exiting
a pain for people who live here too
everytime -PRON- get on the elevator there be people in -PRON- someone always comment about the need for the fob not in a good way
-paper thin wall ceiling and door lack of privacy and -PRON- can hear everything upstairs and in -PRON- hall literally hear -PRON- every time the person upstairs take every step do not help that -PRON- stomp when -PRON- walk
-unit be lack storage\/coat closet area but there be a ton of storage unit for rent in the building
-PRON- obviously think about milking tenant when build this place
party atmosphere if -PRON- ever want to live at the w hotel in downtown scottsdale that be what this building be go for
posers millennial wanna be barbie welcome everyone else have to put up with the dorm like atmosphere in the hallway
literally 5 6 people hang out in the hallway all of the time
seem like everyone under 30 in the building know each other or move in together
-PRON- guess -PRON- parent get some sort of bulk discount
so to sum up if -PRON- want to live in a pretty loud dorm with a great location this be the place
have live in japan for a year -PRON- have a pretty high standard for ramen place in toronto since the amount of $ -PRON- cost for raman in this city be grossly over price even when compare to japan and -PRON- much high living standard
-PRON- have be mean to check out hakata for almost 3 year and finally drop in with -PRON- wife and order 1
shio ramen 2
gyoza 3
mini slow cook braise pork don
-PRON- 1 policy in all raman place that i visit for the first time be to order the simple bowl of ramen which in most case would be shio raman
-PRON- believe this be the perfect way to really evaluate the quality\/taste of the original broth
when -PRON- receive -PRON- bowl do not attack the noodle right away but just grab a spoon and take in a spoonful of soup with -PRON- eye closed
this will explain much of the bowl of that raman before -PRON- even dabble with the noodle
if the broth be good -PRON- can cover alot of other short come such as lack quality of noodle and other topping
first of all gyoza be freeze pre package one
-PRON- make gyoza from scratch from time to time
so -PRON- be disappointing for -PRON-
and the place be not all that clean
there be a corridor that lead to the back of the resto where the bathroom be situate
when -PRON- go to the bathroom the kitchen be on the right hand side and -PRON- can see part of the kitchen and -PRON- be kinda filthy
also the cook with super dirty aprin come out couple of time to serve food until additional evening server arrive
and -PRON- be not pleasant especially after see the state of the kitchen be in on -PRON- way and back to\/from the bathroom
then the mini don come out
that be the good dish and -PRON- be slightly good than average
then finally the shio raman come out
game over music*.
very disappointed with sub par flavour broth and soft\/un chewy noodle
just do -PRON- for -PRON- and i will not return to hakata
imo santouka
ryus be top notch but still yet to have try isshin and ryoji
kinton 's way
over rat yet sansotei be pretty decent
-PRON- would rate hakata to be at the very bottom of this roaster
-PRON- be so glad that a friend of mine choose this for -PRON- double date night
-PRON- have drive past here several time and never think to try -PRON-
-PRON- be not crazy about the chip here but love the spicy pickle carrot slice that come atop -PRON-
-PRON- dish be fabulous
-PRON- order the fajitas cozumel make with shrimp and tilapia this dish be fresh and fabulous
not to mention huge -PRON- take home almost half
next time -PRON- will definitely go back hopefully on a day that -PRON- be not pour rain(as
-PRON- be when -PRON- go because -PRON- would love to sit outside
so nice
after year of avoid the dentist -PRON- finally decide to start get -PRON- tooth fix
dr. davis be great and help -PRON- understand all the work that have or need to be do
and the hygienist give -PRON- the good cleaning -PRON- have have
although -PRON- have be year
overall -PRON- be a great experience staff be friendly and the fact -PRON- be open late one day a week keep -PRON- from miss any work
when i check in the front desk be under staff
-PRON- be have a wedding check in that day
so -PRON- would think -PRON- would have have more than one person up front
-PRON- be there for two night and have two room
-PRON- leave -PRON- necklace in the room by mistake and the housekeeper steal the necklace
when i call the front desk about -PRON- -PRON- have -PRON- would check into -PRON-
-PRON- call back and be tell -PRON- have to speak to the housekeeping manager
-PRON- call -PRON- back and find nothing
then -PRON- call for three day after -PRON- stay to the general manager
leave two message and when -PRON- finally get a hold of -PRON- -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- have not have time to check -PRON- message
after tell -PRON- what have happen -PRON- be tell -PRON- do not tolerate this kind of behavior and would check into -PRON-
-PRON- call -PRON- the next day leave -PRON- a message nothing come up
there be nothing i can do about -PRON- necklace
-PRON- call -PRON- back again to leave another message and have not hear from -PRON- since
obviously -PRON- staff be not go to tell -PRON- there be steal out of people room
so now -PRON- housekeeper have -PRON- necklace
come here while on vacation in las vegas
have to wait a little while to be seat however -PRON- be in a decent sized group of 8 people so -PRON- be expect that -PRON- may have to wait
once -PRON- be seat -PRON- waiter come to take -PRON- drink order immediately
unfortunately -PRON- can not remember what -PRON- name be however -PRON- give -PRON- great service and have an energetic personality really funny
-PRON- end up order 4 bottle of a chianti and 6 calzone and 1 large pizza all with different topping and or filling
-PRON- be really nice how -PRON- have -PRON- be
-PRON- can choose -PRON- ingredient off a list and add as much of what ingredient as -PRON- want
-PRON- be carnivore so -PRON- pack -PRON- with meat
-PRON- do take a little while for -PRON- order to reach -PRON- table about 25 minute however -PRON- have multiple bottle of wine
-PRON- do not mind a little wait
when the food do reach -PRON- table -PRON- look and smell amazing
upon bite in -PRON- taste even better then -PRON- look
-PRON- can tell -PRON- be fresh make straight from the oven
the crust have a nice crunch on the outside yet soft more fully inside texture
overall taste of the food be great
be waiter would stop by the table every so often and check in on how the food be and would engage in small talk each time which -PRON- enjoy
after -PRON- be finish eat -PRON- still have a lot of late night plan yet be feel a little sleepy after devour all the delicious food
-PRON- waiter overhear -PRON- talk about -PRON- and bring -PRON- all free coffee to help keep -PRON- up and -PRON- sure do
overall -PRON- have a great experience here and if -PRON- ever find -PRON- in vegas again look for some pizza -PRON- shall return
-PRON- love everything -PRON- have have at pane bianco
-PRON- food be fresh and delicious and the place be absolutely adorable
-PRON- be disappointed that -PRON- do not serve -PRON- pizza at lunch time and -PRON- do wish that -PRON- have a cheap side salad to go along with -PRON- entree but other than those two small complaint this place rock
delicious fresh food and awesome customer service
-PRON- be so helpful and friendly
-PRON- have be to this place a few time over and have yet to be disappoint in the taste flavor and attention to detail that -PRON- put into each plate
great breakfast spot
-PRON- choose this place base on the yelp review and be not disappoint
good food at very reasonable price
decor be quaint not fancy but clean and welcoming
never have saganaki before
but -PRON- highly recommend -PRON-
the ride be about 30 40 minute long but -PRON- can not say -PRON- be impressed
-PRON- pay for a view that -PRON- already get from -PRON- hotel room luckily -PRON- win the ride and do not have to pay
security be extremely rude and honestly can not say well ever go back
the yelp page say that upon check in -PRON- will give -PRON- 15 off but -PRON- do not
-PRON- come there today 's morning and when -PRON- tell the guy at the cash who be polite and friendly about the deal -PRON- say -PRON- use to but not anymore
and -PRON- explain that -PRON- can not do the calculation -PRON- because the machine do not show the discount in the receipt and -PRON- would be a huge complication
even though -PRON- do not complain and understand -PRON- point -PRON- be not convinced that why -PRON- have advertise for something -PRON- do not offer
this first impression really shadow -PRON- whole experience eat there and -PRON- do not much enjoy -PRON- food
-PRON- sweet crepe taste too sweet oily and not well cook at some part
the two star be just for -PRON- cozy atmosphere and -PRON- polite staff
still have not receive a call back about -PRON- stay the beginning of july
absolutely ridiculous be consider stay here for -PRON- visit in october if a manager actually reach out to -PRON- email about the complaint
-PRON- have noooo light in -PRON- room for 24 + hour
no wifi and if the wifi be available -PRON- be never able to connect
never again

-PRON- wish the sweet corn be year round
absolutely worth an out of a way drive or a long phoenix layover
there be very few place around that sell a line of skincare that -PRON- love environ
while in montreal i figure -PRON- would stock up since -PRON- know that this place carry -PRON-
even though -PRON- could find -PRON- in boston -PRON- still suck -PRON- up and pay double the price lus the ridiculous qc tax but -PRON- worth -PRON- when -PRON- need -PRON-
the woman that help -PRON- be very friendly and speak english french and franglais
-PRON- be also very knowledgeable about all kind of product and make up but -PRON- be not there for make up
anyway
i'd go back here if -PRON- need to
as far as overprice coffee go these guy be ok
-PRON- be also open for late night snackage
which be why -PRON- get 3 star
because when -PRON- be late and -PRON- do not want to call room service -PRON- can race down in -PRON- pj 's and get stuff and race back to -PRON- room
good thing be that -PRON- have the feeling the local be use to scurr australian 's in -PRON- pj be at odd hour of the night scavang for food
amid a delightful neighborhood fill with nice sit down restaurant lie presti 's
this be the holy grail of take a number and wait in line
family run presti 's offer a full range of baked good italian fare espresso drink and even gelato
-PRON- always have different food make fresh in the display ripe for the ordering
if the crowd be any indication of popularity then -PRON- may be regina george without the attitude
-PRON- only advice be get there early unless -PRON- want a long line
-PRON- love boa
but -PRON- be not just the good food but the super awesome staff
-PRON- husband and -PRON- come to boa for -PRON- happy hour on 10.2.11 for a light anniversary meal

as for the gallery at the art factory and art square well -PRON- do not expect to walk away with several piece but i do
the price be super deal for what i get
i even buy a cat painting from a young teenage girl who go by the name of jojo
so adorable
-PRON- will include photo of the piece i buy

i be look forward to when the large scale art walk return
great customer service awesome price and spectacular work
thank -PRON- brett and -PRON- crew
the royal yacht be a great place for most age except perhaps the very young or the very old
-PRON- visit a few week back on a sunny march saturday as a family
the audio tour for child be a must if -PRON- have any with -PRON- young than 13 or so
-PRON- be concerned that dad -PRON- would want to tour at a slow pace than -PRON- daughter 12 6 but for the most part there be plenty to keep -PRON- occupy as -PRON- examine photo document artifact etc
-PRON- favourite part of the tour be the many photo of the family
as an american -PRON- do not have strongly hold emotional tie for or against the monarchy but simply enjoy the memento of family
the staff be outstanding friendly knowledgeable without interfere in the enjoyment of the tour
if -PRON- have time the royal yacht britannia be a great addition to -PRON- edinburgh itinerary
since this place be in -PRON- new neighborhood on the recommendation of a friend -PRON- decide to check -PRON- out
-PRON- have become -PRON- cheer
the bartender be friendly
the service be great
-PRON- be glad -PRON- finally stop by
the menu be adequate and tasty
the kitchen be open late too
-PRON- be tell -PRON- be under new management about the last 2 month
-PRON- certainly show
this be a hidden gem in spring valley
-PRON- be happy to see something healthy open up around the middleburg\/parma area
-PRON- think the idea be great and be someone who pass by on the way to the gym this be something -PRON- could not pass up
the smoothie -PRON- have be the breakfast smoothie with peanut butter protein yogurt chocolate and banana
not exactly the healthy -PRON- offer
-PRON- be sure but -PRON- be darn tasty
the problem -PRON- have with many of -PRON- smoothie be everything seem to contain sherbert
-PRON- like sherbert just not in -PRON- smoothie
-PRON- would like to see some more smoothie that just contain yogurt and fruit
-PRON- feel the smoothie be price well and -PRON- definitely fill -PRON- up
on the food side -PRON- be a little lacking
this be the major downside for -PRON-
-PRON- feel like -PRON- would come much more often if there be a little more variety in the wrap
-PRON- be not a tuna or spinach fan so -PRON- get the spicy chicken wrap
-PRON- be delicious though and spicy
-PRON- love spicy food and -PRON- seem a lot of place really dumb down the spice
not here
-PRON- wrap pack a punch and will send -PRON- tastebud for a ride
the wrap -PRON- be a great texture not too gummy or firm
overall not -PRON- favorite smoothie haven by far but everything be tasty and -PRON- be unique for the area
fabulous flavorful food with a great balance of heat spice and complex flavor
-PRON- order off menu -PRON- szechwan cucumber which be fresh crisp slightly salty with a great hot oil and many red chilie tuck into the dish
-PRON- add a little of the table chili sauce to compliment the heat already in the dish and -PRON- be a great appetizer
-PRON- order the water boiled beef even though -PRON- come with a warning to some customer that -PRON- may be too spicy and oily and -PRON- be deliver bubble hot with lovely slice of cooked beef and vegetable in a wonderful stock with a chili oil and pepper flavor that be perfectly balance
heat taste and a great texture
all combine for a really wonderful entree
this be a spicy dish without a doubt but the warning be unwarranted as -PRON- allow the great flavor to come through and when combine with the generous portion of rice serve -PRON- be a perfect meal
-PRON- waiter paul be very excited about the dish and when -PRON- find out -PRON- have like -PRON- so much -PRON- promise to make -PRON- a special dish not on the menu next time -PRON- come in
that will be very soon
the chinese menu be more complex as be the special on the board come in
-PRON- be look forward to another meal here shortly to keep sample this well execute food at szechwan palace
wow -PRON- have be to cracker barrel 's all over this great united states of our have have some of the great meal in -PRON- life
but this cracker barrel be in trouble -PRON- have one of the bad meal in -PRON- life
-PRON- chef salad look to have be put together use the cook foot
the staff be on organize chaotic with zero communication skill
the manager be run around like a chicken with -PRON- head cut off not know which way to go or who to attend to
corporate good get involve with this one or -PRON- will be a short lived
-PRON- would think the first one in vegas would have a little more experienced staff run -PRON-
to say -PRON- be extremely disappointed would be an understatement
good breakfast place in vegas
good food good service good price
-PRON- favorite be the portuguese sausage and egg with a side of orange dreamsicle pancake
-PRON- would go every weekend if -PRON- be not worried about get chubby
go there on a weeknight and the place be crowd
hear other talk about -PRON-
so -PRON- give -PRON- a try
surprisingly with -PRON- be so pack -PRON- do not have to wait to be seat
the service be pretty awesome food be good and the beer be tasty
great first experience
-PRON- only complaint be that -PRON- be really noisy but what be -PRON- go to do when -PRON- have that many customer
with so many customer the service still be great
-PRON- go because -PRON- need a note for -PRON- fibromyaltia
the woman dr.\/practitioner be very ruid
-PRON- think -PRON- think -PRON- come in for pain med
-PRON- sup need 1 for hr to explain the fibromyaltia
-PRON- come in with attitude and leave with attitude state let -PRON- look at -PRON- chart
and -PRON- will get -PRON- a prescription
-PRON- thru -PRON- off first like -PRON- be attack -PRON-
-PRON- work for a live 7 day a week
and -PRON- definately do not need to be treat that way
-PRON- walk out with nothing
-PRON- guess when -PRON- treat most people that be on welfare -PRON- automatically expect people be want pain med
if -PRON- sound angry -PRON- be
no one should be treat that way period

-PRON- suggest the roll lover combo or one of -PRON- lunch special such as the nama sushi
-PRON- can customize -PRON- order to -PRON- preference as well
visited vegas on vacation and since -PRON- do not have a jimmy john 's nearby -PRON- decide to take -PRON- here

super clean location staff be all smile and super friendly and the food be delicious
-PRON- come in when -PRON- be fairly busy and -PRON- still get -PRON- meal almost quicker than -PRON- get -PRON- receipt from pay

-PRON- hate to be redundant
but -PRON- would also hate to understate thing good bbq
-PRON- have ever have
the pull pork be excellent but the fatty brisket be truly sublime
jalapeño cheese grit be excellent as be the cole slaw which be not drown in mayo
first -PRON- would like to say that this men 's warehouse deserve 10 star instead of five
-PRON- be -PRON- first time at this specific location
and -PRON- go there 30 minute before -PRON- close
-PRON- feel really bad but -PRON- be an emergency
-PRON- husband have send out -PRON- résumé for job interview and -PRON- call -PRON- say -PRON- need a suit for an interview the next day
-PRON- rush over to men 's warehouse and when -PRON- enter the store -PRON- already have a suit pick out for -PRON- -PRON- measurement be already in -PRON- computer from -PRON- wedding
once -PRON- approve of the whole ensemble one of the employee take -PRON- husband slack and hem -PRON- up right then and there
the employee do not act annoyed or unhappy that -PRON- come in so late and without -PRON- husband
now this be truely customer service
-PRON- husband love the craft beer selection -PRON- be what people would call a beer snob so -PRON- know -PRON- must be approve
the brewery also carry other az beer on tap so -PRON- can try something from other local brewery 's
the owner give -PRON- a really neat informative tour of the brew room
the food be good -PRON- have have the hamburger the mac n cheese bite the chicken sandwich

-PRON- selection from the menu be a hit and a miss
the steam bun be really good
three or four steam bun would have be a memorable meal
-PRON- have a spicy pork short rib that be serve on the side
and -PRON- be also very good
-PRON- main dish a large bowl of noodle with a broth be not something -PRON- would order again
to be fair -PRON- be not familiar with japanese cuisine
the noodle dish may be great example of this style of cooking but the one -PRON- choose be more of a soup than a main course
-PRON- be just a little too salty and not fill enough for -PRON- preference
with additional experience order from the menu -PRON- be confident -PRON- could narrow the choice down to item that would be a good fit and a good experience for -PRON-

and -PRON- do a fantastic job

and -PRON- other location in huntersville be also really really good
-PRON- will not be disappoint with this place

i receive some beautiful flower last week
just get around to reviewing
-PRON- be still in good shape and i love -PRON-
what be not to love about flower right
these just have lot of style and femininity
sometimes flower look phony be have some tacky teddy bear attach
not these
just beautiful
stay classy fleurish
attn pho pro don't
eat here
-PRON- notice the mixed review for this place but decide to give -PRON- a try because -PRON- be recommend to -PRON- by a fellow yelper
-PRON- be surprisingly disappointed
here be -PRON- phonalysis spring roll loosely wrap and lack flavor
-PRON- have way too much noodle stuff in there to make the roll seem big
even the peanut sauce be mediocre
-PRON- mean how do -PRON- screw up the peanut sauce
broth
-PRON- be super excited when -PRON- pho come out because -PRON- be steam and look amazing
that is until -PRON- taste the broth
-PRON- be so bland -PRON- be not sure if -PRON- boil any herb
actually -PRON- do not even have a beef flavor so maybe -PRON- toss in some boiling water and sprinkle instant pho season
meat
very tender and fresh but very small portion
vegetable
very fresh and perhaps the only non disappointing thing of the night but do not redeem everything else
-PRON- be give this place one star for friendly service and how frequently the waitress refill -PRON- water
-PRON- know -PRON- be a pho snob
and -PRON- be not say the soup be disgusting
but -PRON- would definitely never come back here
there be much good place in the valley for great pho
this classic duel coaster never go out of style
very few people know that the two race car be actually on one track
-PRON- be a great wooden coaster and -PRON- be design so -PRON- never know who win
since two be always run line move fairly quick in order to board
-PRON- end up here after check in late night eat be in demand with toddler in tow and the front desk tell -PRON- that raffle be 24hrs red\/w\/b be open till 11 and bayside buffet close at 10
-PRON- should have order room service or go to raffle
service be godawful such attitude
seriously lady -PRON- leave a 22percent tip but only as an eff a do -PRON- really think -PRON- deserve that
-PRON- sit down and -PRON- provide a highchair
nice the $ 12 matzo ball soup $ 18 tuna melt $ 19 pastrami
overpriced and put deli to shame
like -PRON- say -PRON- should have order room service and call -PRON- a a night
the kicker as -PRON- be 1\/4 do with -PRON- sandwich
rude waitress ask -PRON- if -PRON- would like box
ummmmmmm
wtf
seriously
-PRON- be ok about -PRON- since -PRON- figure -PRON- would just take everything upstairs
but what the heck never again
-PRON- could have check the review before choose this place
waste of $ and time
-PRON- guess some people get sitter so -PRON- can go enjoy real restaurant like fleur de lys only step away
but since -PRON- choose not to something about a random person hang with -PRON- little man scar -PRON- -PRON- mandalay bay experience have -PRON- limit and why be -PRON- computer automaticaly change -PRON- -PRON- to -PRON- be
-PRON- have be go here for a while now and to this day
-PRON- have not have better tasting bbq in ontario so far
-PRON- have travel all over ontario for work and try every single bbq spot -PRON- could find but none of -PRON- taste as good
to add to the delicious bbq food -PRON- have creole food too
the etoufee be absolutely fantastic
the braised beef ribs be to die for
the beef brisket be as tender and as juicy as -PRON- come
every single thing -PRON- make there be perfect
-PRON- goto place for southern bbq
value 5\/5 for lunch combo that include a lot of food soup salad main side for ~$9.99 ayce salad bar like 6 7 item an additional 10 off til end of september service 5\/5 serve by manager -PRON-
nash be very personable enthusiastic about explain the ipad ordering and around when -PRON- need -PRON- food 3 3.5\/5 -PRON- hafta knock down some point here because -PRON- do not know how to deep fry thing
fry be extremely greasy arrive shiny so -PRON- be not drain properly
and as per other review soft shell crab be oily so -PRON- be assume -PRON- need to brush up on -PRON- deep frying and most of -PRON- app be deep fry
-PRON- have the lobster sandwich and -PRON- have actual chunks of lobster in -PRON-
so -PRON- be impressed especially consider the price
-PRON- enjoy -PRON-
would go back to try -PRON- boil
-PRON- be a new restaurant
so -PRON- be look to make an impression so go while -PRON- be still new
-PRON- would not go back here
the pizza be not out of this world
-PRON- take forever to get serve and the server be late with everything extra that -PRON- ask for
the cheese bread be commercial and could have be make good at home with real cheese
the caesar salad lack enough dressing but be good once -PRON- ask for more
-PRON- hear the deep dish pizza be amazing but -PRON- do not want to wait 1 hour and ten minute for that since -PRON- be starve
have a great time
perfect for food football and sunday funday
would come back for any sporting event
although hesitant to come here with some out of country guest after a few less than successful visit to the bayview village location -PRON- be really glad -PRON- do
want to be able to offer -PRON- guest a wide menu selection with good quality food but also reasonable price
-PRON- be hard to pick a place since most place with good eat come with a big price tag in the downtown core
but o&b look up to be the good option and be super close to -PRON- home for the week at 1 king west
-PRON- eat family style and share the beef short rib a prosciutto pizza salad salmon pasta dish and a few dessert and -PRON- as well as -PRON- be happy with all -PRON- choice
friendly and attentive service throughout the night be appreciate and the evening go smoothly
would go back
without hesitation 5stars
-PRON- have a wonderful experience at the roaring fork last saturday evening
and -PRON- can not wait to return
amazing food and amazing service make for a spectacular evening out
wouldn't
-PRON- agree

the roaring fork sponsor the 2008 arizona yoga asana championship which take place in tempe last weekend
follow the competition competitor teacher and volunteer be all invite to enjoy dinner courtesy of roaring fork
from the moment -PRON- walk in the restaurant all of -PRON- sens be stimulate from the delicious smell to the wonderful decor to the terrific music playing -PRON- be perfect
-PRON- enjoy amazing appetizer and a wonderful plank salmon
-PRON- side include macaroni and asparagus that be to die for
although -PRON- do not usually indulge in dessert -PRON- figure -PRON- could reward -PRON- for participate in the competition and enjoy the chocolate lava cake which -PRON- be still dream about
this be by far -PRON- and the hubby 's favorite japanese place in the valley
the sushi roll be typical of what -PRON- would find in just about every other sushi joint but what set hiro apart in -PRON- opinion be the non sushi menu item
-PRON- be reminiscent of -PRON- experience in japan okinawa soba nabeyaki udon and mushroom tea pot soup to name a few
and if -PRON- consider -PRON- an adventurous eater and really do want sushi\/sashimi ask for omakase and the chef will whip up some off the menu item sure to make -PRON- smile
oh and the staff be worth get to know if -PRON- have some time to chat a while
hint -PRON- have life outside of the restaurant
go figure
this place be pretty good
just another unique burger joint
would not compare -PRON- to other but similar to smash burger and five guy
-PRON- have chicken too as well as salad
love this place
the vegan chocolate cookie be awesome
love -PRON- bread
fresh and delicious

xoxo
-PRON- pack way too many people in this club and the crazy thing be that -PRON- have to climb like 10 flight of stair to go up and down the place
in the club -PRON- literally can not move let alone dance
-PRON- be sure the club be nice but the only place -PRON- be able to breathe be on the roof
no thank
-PRON- have be here a few time -PRON- leave with a not so great feeling in the past
but this time -PRON- actually have plenty of staff who be really supportive and helpful as far as get some idea of thing that -PRON- need -PRON-
unlike most furniture store these guy do not work on individual commission so -PRON- partner with expert in the area 's of the store to bring -PRON- the good service
if anything -PRON- find that to be the most valuable part as -PRON- seem more of a team effort
in the end -PRON- find -PRON- a very nice sectional couch that be with the right color and of course at the right price
-PRON- be able to customize and add a few piece to get the size that -PRON- want could not be happy with the process
-PRON- be wait on a delivery this week
bonus feature of this place if -PRON- get the kid -PRON- have a kid playroom with movie video game and art and craft to keep -PRON- busy for at least an hour
if -PRON- finalize a purchase -PRON- can leave -PRON- longer
feel free to ask any of the staff for some ice water coffee tea or even a soft drink and -PRON- will bring -PRON- up to -PRON- because of the experience -PRON- will definitely include this location on -PRON- bucket list whenever -PRON- be look for creative idea for -PRON- home
4 star only because what -PRON- originally come look for and see online be disappointing in person
love the sukiyaki beef
-PRON- be very nice and when -PRON- call in an order -PRON- be ready by the time -PRON- be able to drive -PRON- lamborghini there to pick -PRON- up

-PRON- screw up -PRON- tab overcharge -PRON- and other in -PRON- party
-PRON- do not have any flatwear\/chopstick for a straight minute and have to flag down someone to get some minute after -PRON- food arrive
service need to be tighten up -PRON- need a manager on duty at all time or something
also -PRON- be not a bad idea to have -PRON- food runner smile
-PRON- hat -PRON- job and -PRON- project -PRON- dampen -PRON- loose and fun group

-PRON- be a top notch barber and a fun conversationalist
give the barbershop at gold coast a shot for a well price well do hair cut

the thing about turkish food be the sauce
-PRON- have have turkish food in restaurant all over the world and say quite consistently that -PRON- be -PRON- favourite food
in -PRON- experience turkish food be always define by the sauce recipe of the family that make -PRON- no matte how hole in the wall -PRON- be or upscale
the chef\/cook family recipe seem to define whether -PRON- horrible or amazing
and this place
-PRON- have avoid write a review about this place because well -PRON- be do just fine with out the internet
-PRON- be pretty sure the place across the street open up the one with the red and white sign because of how good this place become to be know
not
even
close
this place have a really basic menu that have everything -PRON- want
-PRON- be talk about the veal with rice
spicy
all the sauce
that s -PRON-
fine
the chicken be really good too but -PRON- about the sauce
when this husband and wife couple open this restaurant in 2002ish -PRON- be halfway through ryerson and -PRON- keep -PRON- come there almost daily because that buttery rice and the sauce be so damn good with veal or chicken
take a hike salad
no room for -PRON-
anyways fast forward over a decade later in many different country and city lot of turkish food later and when -PRON- move back to toronto
the sauce be still exactly the same and turn out -PRON- the good -PRON- have be able to find
in this city
in this country
on this continent
in this hemisphere
in the other hemisphere
anywhere
just -PRON- best -PRON- have ever have
-PRON- have a son or nephew in -PRON- teen when -PRON- go while in school
-PRON- hope -PRON- teach -PRON- the recipe
because that stuff be so good not to pass down
oh and uhhh internet do not go there
yeah
-PRON- be busy with umm stuff
-PRON- be not one to give 5 star but vovomeena deserve -PRON-
incredible food incredible staff
the quality of food be exceptional fresh perfectly cooked and thoughtfully present
-PRON- coffee be excellent too
add the donut to -PRON- order
this be a difficult review to rate since -PRON- have have excellent food here
and -PRON- have have terrible food here
-PRON- be hit or miss constantly
today -PRON- come in to get -PRON- regular p2 rare beef pho and -PRON- be awful the broth taste off and almost burn the meat be tough and really chewy
just last week -PRON- grab a p2 and -PRON- taste amazing
-PRON- dining companion have a veggie pho
and -PRON- say the broth be really off as well
8\/29 bouncer out front be ridiculously rude and thuggish and -PRON- do not even ask for -PRON- id or say anything to -PRON- be swear and talk amongst -PRON- loudly while walk up
server w the black lipstick be poor
burger good
chicken wrap be the consistency of thick salsa\/sloppy joe
wish there be more nuance\/less blending of the ingredients\/more veggie etc
the accompany sauce be too sweet and do not add anything
the new area to the east -PRON- just open seem like waste space
people be not kid about this be one of vegas good keep secret
what a fun show and wally eastwood juggler host be hilarious
the good part of this show from what -PRON- have see be the variety hence the name
-PRON- also showcas some very talented people
-PRON- only complaint be the theater
not a traditional venue and -PRON- have try to make -PRON- work but there be some very obnoxious post that block the view to the stage
these be only an issue for -PRON- section general admission
some people on here encourage and -PRON- would second -PRON- to get in line earlier to get a good seat
however -PRON- can tell the entertainer know this be an issue and -PRON- plan -PRON- act around these blind spot as to not leave anyone out
great show
-PRON- may go see -PRON- again as -PRON- be tell the act switch out
if this show continue to build in popularity -PRON- can see caesar 's entertainment move -PRON- to a big venue
just order food from this joint
took forever and then forget hot sauce\/ranch
still bring but tell -PRON- -PRON- would have to wait another 45 minute to an hour for hot sauce and ranch
so now -PRON- chicken wing will be cold
excellent service
whack deliverysuck terriblecustomerservice
breakfast food be quite creative but mediocre in quality at good
beautiful layout and friendly staff\/management
-PRON- personal experience would not compel a return visit
do not use online coupon as -PRON- will be disappoint
if -PRON- be drive to this location be mindful of the parking parking garage charge in half hour increment
some of the vegan food be questionably vegan
make sure -PRON- ask ahead of time
what a great early afternoon show
have -PRON- sister visit and -PRON- go to catch this show
very entertaining and mysterious
highlight be when -PRON- sister boyfriend get pick to go up on stage
this be proof that -PRON- be not a pre plan show
great way to spend the afternoon
-PRON- a great place to hang out on the weekend
friendly staff great food fun atmosphere variety of event \/special and a warm patio for the winter time
always nice to see familiar friendly face
-PRON- spend most of -PRON- childhood grow up in the middle east
since there be not a lot of middle eastern restaurant where -PRON- live -PRON- be always on the lookout for authentic middle eastern food when -PRON- travel
this place be not authentic
yes -PRON- use word like kabob and falafel to reel -PRON- in but that be all -PRON- be empty word
-PRON- order the chicken kabob sandwich and be very disappointed at how dry and unseason the chicken be
there be not even a hint of the middle eastern spice that -PRON- grow up with that be suppose to tantalize with every bite
the hummus be just mash chick pea devoid of any seasoning
-PRON- know -PRON- should not expect much from mall food but -PRON- want even just a hint of flavor
-PRON- only add the extra star because -PRON- be a mall establishment
-PRON- have literally try to order the same drink for 2 to 3 week now
-PRON- be very simple peach tea and lemonade with three pump of classic
every single time -PRON- be wrong
-PRON- may ask why continue come back to the starbucks
-PRON- be do -PRON- own little experiment at this point just to see how stupid and entire staff could possibly be
turn out every person that work there that -PRON- have come in contact with be incapable of do -PRON- job
this all could have be correct if when -PRON- call to complain the conflict be resolve but instead some little asshole name zach decide to laugh and be a smart ass on the phone with -PRON- and talk to -PRON- like -PRON- be one of -PRON- little homeboy
learn how to make a drink properly and listen instead of rush -PRON- customer through the drive through
somebody should fire zack 's little punk ass also
food be good
the reason for not give -PRON- more star be the consistently sloooow service
-PRON- keep go back because the food be so good
but even when -PRON- be not busy and -PRON- be the only one in the place -PRON- take a long time for someone to take -PRON- order
-PRON- favorite thing on the menu be the pad kee mao
try -PRON-
-PRON- be great
one of the old italian delis in edinburgh if not the old valvona and crolla hide a pleasant surprise if -PRON- walk through to the back of the shop
tuck away at the rear be a surprisingly large bright and modern look cafe
all light wood and roof window -PRON- be a very pleasant space that seem popular with local and savvy visitor -PRON- be a bit off the beat track tourist wise but just a few minute walk down the road from the omni centre which be -PRON- just beyond princes street down
have a pleasant enough brunch in the cafei
lovely croissant great bread good bacon butty and tasty vegetarian breakfast which include grill polenta roast and grill italian veggie top off with a fry egg
mmmmm
bit more expensive than the usual cafe fare but a nice treat
-PRON- drive by here last week and -PRON- fiancee be actually the one that notice -PRON-
after see that slidin thru be go and braddah 's be in -PRON- place -PRON- be both immediately intrigue
-PRON- get on yelp and check out the review and be happy to see that -PRON- be amazing
well -PRON- decide to try the place out for dinner today and -PRON- get to say the great review be justify
as soon as -PRON- walk in -PRON- be immediately greet by the employee and -PRON- ask if -PRON- have ever be there
since -PRON- never have -PRON- obviously say no and the girl help -PRON- give -PRON- sample of the three meat -PRON- offer pork chicken and steak
the pork be good but taste like typical pull pork but the chicken and steak be damn good
the chicken have this nice smoky taste to -PRON- and the steak be tender and have a touch of sweetness
-PRON- could not decide so the worker tell -PRON- that -PRON- can mix the meat if -PRON- would like how awesome be that
-PRON- also let -PRON- sample -PRON- different salsa the green pineapple one and the corn one be both really good
so -PRON- mix those in as well
the rest be pretty much an assembly line setup be -PRON- pick what -PRON- want
-PRON- start out by choose either a burrito bowl salad or taco
from there -PRON- just throw in whatev -PRON- want
-PRON- be a really great experience and -PRON- hope the place stick around in this location because -PRON- be just plain awesome
the customer service be great the food be delicious and fill a bowl be enough for two meal and the coconut bark be a great way to wrap up the meal
nothing good than salty sweet chocolate toffee goodness to end a tasty dinner

the spa be like a place of -PRON- own locate in the low level of the hotel

-PRON- wish -PRON- could have stay the entire day
-PRON- usually read comment
but this time -PRON- need to share -PRON- feeling

-PRON- do not have any improvement and can not maintain the good quality
any one of the bbq restaurant
even bbq stall in chinese supermarket or in food court

dessert
-PRON- do not wait for -PRON- attitude of the waiter
like -PRON- boss if -PRON- be workaholic please come here enjoy -PRON- meal with -PRON- boss sam woo bbq
bye
bye
-PRON- never come again
nice new look clean salon
everyone seem nice and have a smile for -PRON-
good product as well
seem -PRON- only do hair do not see any nail station or pedi chair set up or wax room
-PRON- like the gal who color -PRON- hair -PRON- listen to what -PRON- want and also give -PRON- own opinion to add a few highlight which -PRON- do
-PRON- do a good job and be very nice
-PRON- will def return and go to -PRON- again
bring -PRON- boyfriend here for -PRON- 30th birthday
-PRON- have a major sweet tooth and a love affair with baked good so -PRON- figure nothing could be good
-PRON- try four variety half baked vanilla cupcake with chocolate chip cookie dough cookies and cream lemon and toffee coffee
the half baked taste like a chocolate chip muffin cover in too sweet frosting
neither of -PRON- be impressed
the cookies and cream frosting be divine but the cupcake just taste like vanilla there be only one cookie speck in -PRON-
-PRON- do not try the lemon as -PRON- do not like lemony dessert but this be -PRON- boyfriend 's favorite
the toffee coffee be definitely the most flavorful and also the sweet
-PRON- be quite good but -PRON- become rather overpower after a couple of bite
the cupcake here be average sized not huge monstrosity like -PRON- sometimes see
-PRON- prefer this as -PRON- feel less guilty try more than one
despite the fact that some lack flavor -PRON- be easy to tell that -PRON- be freshly bake with quality ingredient
the staff be very very friendly and chat with -PRON- while -PRON- taste -PRON- creation in the store
the store -PRON- be quite cute but -PRON- be still figure out the exact configuration since -PRON- just open
-PRON- will likely visit again in the hope that -PRON- find a certain variety one with peanut butter perhaps
that -PRON- just fall head over heel for
-PRON- be thoroughly appal by -PRON- dealing with first sonoran property management
fortunately -PRON- be smart enough to very carefully read through the lease before sign -PRON- and come across a lot of the extra fee and deposit and other loophole that appear very much stack against the tenant
also some detail to which -PRON- have verbally agree be not in the lease as -PRON- have previously agree
when -PRON- list out -PRON- concern in a polite and detailed email to the staff at fspm -PRON- email response be not just unprofessional but very rude
even if -PRON- could have work out the few concern -PRON- have with -PRON- lease these be not people with whom -PRON- would like to deal for the year or year of a lease term
-PRON- read other review of fspm on yelp and ripoff report
every single reviewer report similarly dreadful experience with this company
tracey the designate broker rebut every bad review with the same line
everybody be look for someone to blame
-PRON- opinion be that one bad review be an occurrence
two bad review be a coincidence
three bad review be a pattern
-PRON- be not people who be look for someone to blame for a deal go wrong
-PRON- be people who choose to do business with fair minded and integrous people
in the short time -PRON- try to deal with first sonoran property management -PRON- absolutely do not operate with a shred of integrity
-PRON- would strongly advise against rent from -PRON-
-PRON- girlfriend and -PRON- mother use to go to this place
so -PRON- decide to cheat on -PRON- shop and go here as well
big mistake
-PRON- car be overheat and $ 450.00 + later -PRON- car still have the same problem
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- be go to cost another $ 400 + to fix and -PRON- tell -PRON- where to shove -PRON-
i be knowledgeable enough mechanically to understand car and especially enough to know someone be try to rip -PRON- off
-PRON- take the car home and flush the system -PRON-
problem solve
about a month later -PRON- car start overheat again
-PRON- be sure if -PRON- try to take -PRON- in to -PRON- -PRON- would have try to pull $ 400 out of -PRON-
-PRON- go to -PRON- normal shop chapman 's auto in north phoenix at 40th st greenway
worth the drive
-PRON- be honest and do not charge -PRON- to guess at the problem
-PRON- show -PRON- that one of the item that dana place on in -PRON- attempt to fix -PRON- overheating problem be not tighten and place on right
now -PRON- car work correctly and -PRON- will never go back to dana auto
big rip off
if u be a raman fanatic
this be not the spot for u. ramen broth be at the bottom of -PRON- list
this raman spot be gear towards americans
this be not shinshengumi umenoya or rkraman or other authentic japanese ramen spot
also raman cost $ 17
-PRON- expect top quality raman
thumb down
very honest place
-PRON- have be come here for many year and george and jacki the owner be awesome
malissa work in the front and be great knowledgeable about the car and understand everything -PRON- need so -PRON- can explain -PRON- to the mechanic
hector be -PRON- favorite -PRON- usually work on -PRON- car and have work here for at least 10 year
-PRON- be so nice to see employee stick around at a company
-PRON- love come here because -PRON- know -PRON- will fully inspect -PRON- car tell -PRON- what -PRON- need and what -PRON- may need in the future
-PRON- never pressure -PRON- in to get thing that -PRON- do not need
the pricing be more than reasonable good in town
if -PRON- need a great repair from honest people come to desert oasis -PRON- will be so happy -PRON- do
go here twice during -PRON- vacation
first time -PRON- go to the range for awhile then to the course
give -PRON- pay $ 30 for both some range ball 9 hole and the cart be include -PRON- say -PRON- get a good value
however the course need a lot of work
-PRON- could tell the people who come here do not care about the green fill -PRON- divot etc
the staff be just ok service wise
the girl in the front be so rude -PRON- literally ask -PRON- what the heck do -PRON- want
of course in a joking manner though
the girl at the bar be awesome
the range be definitely the good part of this place
-PRON- be appal with the customer service
-PRON- go in to cancel -PRON- membership and -PRON- never end up be cancel so -PRON- be charge again
-PRON- call to speak to a manager and the girl -PRON- speak with say -PRON- would call -PRON- back
-PRON- never do -PRON- have to call in again to speak with -PRON-
-PRON- be tell -PRON- would contact corporate to issue the refund
the refund never issue -PRON- bank account
so -PRON- call again
mistake happen
-PRON- know -PRON- too work in customer service
so -PRON- simply call back to see if there be something -PRON- could do the manager marissa be apologetic and give -PRON- corporate number
-PRON- call and leave a voicemail and wait two day before -PRON- call again
-PRON- call again and no answer leave another voicemail and wait for a response
still no call back
-PRON- call the salon again and speak with marissa -PRON- say -PRON- be go to call one of the girl at corporate on -PRON- cell phone while -PRON- be on the phone -PRON- do not answer
-PRON- be tell by marissa -PRON- would text -PRON- to call -PRON- asap
two day later still no call back
still no refund
-PRON- call corporate again today and once again get the voicemail
-PRON- do not expect a call back either
-PRON- be very upset because -PRON- keep get the run around about a refund that should be very simple
bad customer service
this be a beautiful hotel downtown montreal great staff up front reasonable rate i book via expedia really nice room with huge bathroom rain shower head etc
enjoy
this place be great
-PRON- come from ca with the kid and -PRON- be come back
-PRON- do not care about any review this place be awesome
great food great service
-PRON- may just drive back from la for the food
this be a neat attraction and -PRON- would deserve five star
but -PRON- lose one star because -PRON- be crowd with the high density of hiker on the same trail that -PRON- have ever see
-PRON- arrive on a weekend morning at the echo park lot at 7:45 am and all the parking space be take
several car be already queue up for folk to leave
interestingly a parking space would become available every few minute apparently quite a few hiker be early riser that be already leave by the time of -PRON- arrival
this hike be not for yippy wuss lap dog nor for wimpy human
some of the incline be quite steep with handrail to help -PRON- maintain -PRON- balance
the view from the top be amazing and will temporarily make -PRON- forget about all the other people
-PRON- do not always write yelp review but when -PRON- do the place deserve -PRON-
if -PRON- be look for an upgrade to -PRON- sushi dining experience that will not break the bank this be the next place -PRON- need to eat at
-PRON- eat here for the first time last night
during the 11 2 happy hour
after -PRON- first plate even though -PRON- be chicken
-PRON- could not wait to try more
all the fish be fresh and the flavor\/texture combination be unique and delicious
-PRON- eat
karaage konpa and hamachi sashimi
-PRON- can not wait to go back and will not be satisfied until -PRON- have have the whole menu
also -PRON- be a pretty big obnoxious late night crowd and the service be attentive and the chef seem to turn out plate rather quickly
so kudo all around
find this place on yelp thank yelpers!)- a little off the beaten path
-PRON- be lucky enough to snag the last indoor table on this chilly night as the majority of the place be outside seating
-PRON- can not wait to come back on a nice day
enjoy the craft
beers-
-PRON- have the rosemary ipa
good variety of food include sandwich burger salad flat bread various app and other item
-PRON- really like the tamale and tater tot
cute local restaurant
-PRON- will be back
das ristorante pizzeria da maurizio haben wir in der calwerstrasse in stuttgart gefunden
wir wurden sehr nett empfangen und un wurde gleich ein schöner tisch zugewiesen
ich möchte gleich auf den service eingehen da die die anderen kritiken nicht sehr gut darüber geschrieben haben
wir waren mit dem service sehr zufrieden unser kellner war sehr aufmerksam und ist auf sonderwünsche eingegangen
er war auch ein sehr kompetenter
ansprechpartner in wein fragen nur leider wurde das gute trinkgeld nur wenig gedankt
aber vom service -PRON- war es sehr gut
als vorspeise hatten wir einen gemischten antipasti teller und zum hauptgang hatte meine freundin pasta mit rinderfiletsteifen und ich hatte da kaninchen
alle speisen waren sehr gut
sehr gute italienische küche
mir ist
-PRON- be nachhinein aufgefallen das auf der karte be eingang das glas champagner
8,50 € gekostet hat
und berechnet wurden aber 10,50 € pro glas
das war aber das einigste be nicht gestimmt hat
sehr schöne schlichte und noble einrichtung
alles schön in weiß gehalten
viele geschäftsleute also eher das gehobene publikum
wir werden sicher wiederkomman
a nice place for a quick bite to eat
not fancy somewhere between a delint and a sandwich place
soup sandwich
the staff be very nice
if -PRON- could give -PRON- less than one star -PRON- would
will probably be wind up in small claims court to get reimbursement on a spa repair which the technician -PRON- originally send to -PRON- home screw up
take 6 month to get -PRON- spa fix on -PRON- own
never return call or put -PRON- on hold for 30 + minute to wear -PRON- down
do not enter into a contract with this company
-PRON- use inferior service repair people and try to get out of any and all repair that -PRON- can
this place be absolutely wonderful
the people be so lovely too
the meal be so delicious and -PRON- be willing to alter some of the menu too
-PRON- want the meat and chicken soup but with veggie and -PRON- be happy to make that adjustment for -PRON-
there be no doubt -PRON- will be back
such a great experience
-PRON- come here on -PRON- 1 year anniversary and -PRON- be offer 1 free entree -what a deal
otherwise -PRON- probably would never stop in here
-PRON- get the jasmine rice with tofu and wok glaze veggie and the pineapple sauce top with crispy wonton noodle
-PRON- be pretty busy that day
but -PRON- make the tofu fresh
the tofu be batter cube with a hint of a spicy flavor
-PRON- be pleasantly surprised how tasty -PRON- all be
-PRON- love the concept to customize -PRON- meal even the little ingredient and -PRON- even get the peanut sauce on the side just incase
-PRON- do not like pineapple
but -PRON- be all excellent
-PRON- be enough for 2 meal which be great for the value
-PRON- notice the price be on par with pei wei
but -PRON- love pei wei 's tofu good
-sorry
-PRON- be not bad just personal preference
-PRON- need a bag of the crispy wonton noodle to snack on next time for sure
for -PRON- be so busy the worker be friendly and happy to explain thing on the menu
-PRON- will come back for sure with -PRON- fiancé to try a different combo of flavor
-PRON- be kinda picky so with -PRON- menu
-PRON- be sure -PRON- can find something -PRON- will like
thank for the excellent free meal
foosia keep up the great flavor
this be -PRON- first attempt at write a yelp review so please bear with -PRON-
-PRON- do not have an explanation as to why -PRON- have not be to soho sooner be that -PRON- only live about 10 minute away and have have multiple friend say with conviction that -PRON- will not hang out with -PRON- until -PRON- do
-PRON- be also a huge sushi\/sashimi\/japanese cuisine fanatic
so -PRON- be almost glad there be an hour and a half wait at goyemon -PRON- go to ayce sushi restaurant which factor in -PRON- decision to try out soho instead
when -PRON- arrive on a saturday evening around 6:30pm -PRON- tell -PRON- the wait would be about 45 minute but 30 minute later -PRON- be able to sit at the sushi bar which be where -PRON- prefer to sit anyway
so yay for the actual wait time be short than the anticipate wait time
when -PRON- first pull up to soho hide by a gas station -PRON- may think that -PRON- be just pull up to an average sushi joint but -PRON- prove that look can be deceive
the venue be not too large but -PRON- think that be a positive for local off the strip sushi restaurant
so do not judge this book by -PRON- cover
after be seat at the bar -PRON- be greet by a very enthusiastic outgoing server
after tell -PRON- -PRON- drink of choice be either good beer or whiskey -PRON- recommend a light sparkle cold sake
-PRON- be surprisingly happy with this suggestion since -PRON- be not too sweet and be very very easy drinking
chef john the executive chef and owner be behind the bar and that be a huge plus
-PRON- can tell -PRON- truly care about -PRON- restaurant and -PRON- passion for this japanese artwork be present throughout -PRON- dining experience
-PRON- hear that -PRON- use to be the executive chef of social house at crystals
so -PRON- be guess that may have inspire the name soho
-PRON- could be wrong though so feel free to tell -PRON- if -PRON- be
if -PRON- be look for ayce this be not -PRON- spot but worth the extra buck for a la carte sushi
soho feature fresh specialty fish like strip jack with a mild flavor but firm amazing texture similar to amberjack or yellowtail
and -PRON- have the fresh uni -PRON- have see in vegas
-PRON- have try uni sea urchin before and be not very fond
but -PRON- be assume that be because -PRON- have never have properly prepared\/fresh uni
when -PRON- have -PRON- at soho -PRON- find a new must have
if the uni look like a firm tongue that be when -PRON- know -PRON- have get to try -PRON-
when -PRON- bite into -PRON- -PRON- remind -PRON- of bite into raw liver as far as texture go
maybe -PRON- be a hawaii thing but -PRON- love -PRON-
chef john also bring out the exceptional hokkaido uni straight from japan
-PRON- be life change and the presentation be strip worthy
-PRON- make -PRON- kind of wish -PRON- be on a date rather than a friendly lunch with a girlfriend sorry tiff p
-PRON- also try -PRON- kumamoto oyster real kumamoto oyster
the shell be about the size of a dollar coin random but the only thing -PRON- could compare the size to and be pretty deep with a nice plump oyster
the texture be perfect and partner with -PRON- light house make mignonette force the sweet flavor of the oyster to come out and say hi
other must have be the yellowtail yuzu soy -PRON- be a yuzu whore and the truffle white fish -PRON- be also a truffle whore
in total -PRON- bill be about $ 100 for the two of -PRON- which be awesome
-PRON- also include a complimentary little green tea latte hard candy for each of -PRON- which be always a nice gesture especially for whoo girl or yay girl if -PRON- have one of these as -PRON- girlfriend -PRON- know what -PRON- be talk about
stay classy las vegas thank for stop by
take -PRON- daughter here for lunch last week-
-PRON- be great
the thai tea be delicious and so be the chicken satay with the really tasty cucumber sauce
-PRON- get the 56 flat noodle with broccoli and chicken in a brown sauce
-PRON- love -PRON-
and -PRON- be kind of a picky eater
-PRON- get the red curry pork- very good and spicy
-PRON- will definitely be back
good hawaiian food in town the food be so awesome here
very large portion and the service be great
extremely disappointing customer service experience
-PRON- will not go into the detail since the owner already know the issue yet
-PRON- still refuse to even offer an -PRON- be sorry that happen
-PRON- cake taste great but not good enough to treat pay customer poorly
-PRON- even wait to leave a review to see if -PRON- would respond to -PRON- last email and do the right thing and at least apologize for the horrible customer service experience and -PRON- have yet to respond
even more disappointing
-PRON- need to have an airman 's uniform shorten and decide to give this place a try
amazing work lady
price be reasonable for what -PRON- be ask for
turn around time be a week
-PRON- be very pleased and be ready to rock comicon
-PRON- only wish -PRON- take debt or credit card -PRON- only take cash here
-PRON- have board -PRON- dog here three time
after this third time -PRON- will not board -PRON- here again
-PRON- leave -PRON- dog for four day three night
when -PRON- come to pick -PRON- up -PRON- only have one of the dog bowl that -PRON- leave -PRON- with in -PRON- bag
-PRON- understand that thing get misplace but -PRON- make -PRON- question how -PRON- be get -PRON- drinking water during -PRON- stay if -PRON- bowl be not in -PRON- cage
when -PRON- pick up the dog bed -PRON- leave -PRON- with -PRON- be soak with urine to the extent that -PRON- just throw -PRON- away in the dumpster next to the camp
-PRON- dog have be potty train for over a year and a half now and have never once have an accident in -PRON- dog bed
-PRON- make -PRON- feel like -PRON- be not be take out as often -PRON- need
even at home -PRON- only need to go out about every two hour
-PRON- really enjoy take -PRON- here because of the camp 's convenient location but -PRON- will gladly drive a few extra mile to make sure -PRON- dog be better take care of
-PRON- come to the snhd for several reason recently
immunization for law school and an ahem lady exam
as an uninsured woman -PRON- really have no choice but to come to this clinic rather than visit -PRON- own doctor
due to a preexistent condition -PRON- can not find affordable health coverage at the moment and this be much more cost effective
there be something wrong with live in a country that doesn't
provide affordable care to its citizen
off -PRON- soapbox now
anyway -PRON- have to visit the snhd three different time to take care of all -PRON- stuff and -PRON- be a pretty painless process
-PRON- have to wait a looooong time to get -PRON- immunization and tb test which account for the lose star
-PRON- expect -PRON- but -PRON- be talk about almost three hour and -PRON- be not that busy
that be a long wait
-PRON- female exam a separate visit go much more smoothly
-PRON- feel very comfortable in -PRON- hand
the examination room be sanitary and the staff be very friendly and informative
-PRON- base -PRON- payment on -PRON- income level which make the bill much more affordable than a regular doctor visit
also if for some reason -PRON- can not pay -PRON- will still take care of -PRON- and give -PRON- the service -PRON- need
-PRON- be nice to know that this program be in place for woman who really need -PRON-
-PRON- know some people who can not afford to get regular preventative care otherwise
excellent food and service
yum
great to see non bar\/fri food in medina
-PRON- will be back
-PRON- be able to complete the bianco trifecta pane bar and pizzeria in one day and despite have to wait 3 hour to get into pizzeria bianco -PRON- be totally worth -PRON-
this be probably the good pizza -PRON- have have outside naples
wait time 3
hours
ac and -PRON- arrive at 4 p.m. on a saturday afternoon
bianco open at 5 p.m. and there be already a good sized line
bar bianco next door open at 4 p.m. so -PRON- could go in and get drink while -PRON- wait in line
some people even bring lawn chair like -PRON- be out for a tailgate or a picnic
once the place open and -PRON- start take name -PRON- say -PRON- would be a 2 hour wait
after wander around downtown for a while -PRON- head to bar bianco for some wine app and a game of chess
an excellent way to pass the time
the staff at bar bianco come by and tell -PRON- -PRON- table be ready right about 7 p.m.
1hr to put -PRON- name in + 2 hour to wait = 3 hour total wait time
food
outstanding
spiedini $ 10 italian fontina wrap in prosciutto di parma serve warm
what a way to start a meal
serve on skewer this be an amazing appetizer
the cheese be melty without drip everywhere and the warm prosciutto be excellent
salad $ 6 local organic greens with red wine vinaigrette
pretty standard mixed green salad
margherita pizza $ 13 tomato sauce fresh mozzarella basil
this be why -PRON- come here and -PRON- live up to expectation
the crust be perfectly chewy with a bit of char and flavor from the brick oven
the crust alone would make a great dish
the tomato sauce have the right amount of tang be not too sweet and -PRON- do not drench the pizza in sauce
the mozzarella be excellent and the basil be out of this world
better than anything -PRON- could grow in -PRON- own garden
salami and olive pizza $ 16
tomato sauce fresh mozzarella salami and kalamata olives
there be no skimping on the topping here
first class quality ingredient and plenty of -PRON-
if -PRON- like cure meat this be the way to go
this place be awesome
-PRON- boyfriend and -PRON- order out from here constantly and -PRON- have never have a bad meal
-PRON- get the sweet and sour chicken and -PRON- boyfriend get the basil fry rice delicious
very long wait to get in food be really so so
bad service
really not the place to eat good asian food
and -PRON- be at bellagio so very pricy
really nothing good about this place aside the fact that -PRON- be at bellagio
bad experience ever
the service be slow and not polite and the food be definitely not fresh and some be even inedible
in the end -PRON- get serious food bear and could not even stand up and walk
not like a michelin restaurant and definitely not worth visit -PRON-
-PRON- have some monster hamburger here which be very good
the pierogie be awesome too
everyone at the table seem to have a good meal
-PRON- be also pleased with the beer selection which be pretty much a must if -PRON- be go to call -PRON- a gastropub
-PRON- feel like if -PRON- live near by
-PRON- would be at this place frequently
stop by here during -PRON- visit to toronto back in march
-PRON- believe -PRON- have the london fog and -PRON- sister have the lychee rosewater raspberry
-PRON- be both good but not amazing
ice cream be half about consistency for -PRON- and the ice cream be just a tad too creamy for -PRON- taste
the good part about bang bang be the staff
everyone be super friendly
amazing food amazing vibe amazing staff
-PRON- have the party menu b and everything be delicious
kinka never dissapoint
do not be deter by the shabby exterior in a strip mall in spring valley once inside shobu -PRON- be transport to an authentic japanese sake house
the decor take -PRON- 's cue from a dead tree in the middle of the place an rustic wood paneling
and while sake be the emphasis the sushi and sashimi be the good -PRON- have have in the us
melt in -PRON- mouth yellowtail and halibut and the house invent vampire roll put some southwestern spice in a crab and shrimp roll
full bar several flat screen and what look like a kareoke screen make -PRON- a great place for a night on the town
this be a burger chain i do not hate
most be disappointing
-PRON- have a nice topping selection
compare to anything at bayview village this place be reasonably price for what -PRON- get
good burger and poutine
go to mickie finnz tonight and the food be great
service be awesome too
thank angie for an awesome experience
-PRON- come here on occasion anytime -PRON- be in the mood for cheap food and drink
-PRON- always recommend -PRON- when people complain that urbana restaurant be expensive
bunny 's be super cheap and always have great special
the past two weekend -PRON- have even have live entertainment
while the food be just typical bar food and -PRON- stop serve most of the menu rather early -PRON- be nice to know that -PRON- be available
-PRON- beer selection be not great
-PRON- have six tap and 5 have some variety of mass produce light lager with one serve guinness
-PRON- do have more variety in bottle

the staff be very friendly and attentive

the server be really nice also
-PRON- come back and check on -PRON- several time
the breakfast here be really good -PRON- order an omelette -PRON- can with the typical veggie and ham and bacon ingredient option to go in the omelette -PRON- only complaint be -PRON- do not offer chicken which -PRON- have to pay and additional $ 2.99 for
other than that the food be good
-PRON- husband order the corn beef hash which come out fresh w smothered style potato and egg
overall -PRON- would recommend this place esp for a quick breakfast stop
-PRON- be invite to a birthday dinner and have no idea this place exist
-PRON- be a good little find whose claim to fame be -PRON- fajita which be good
not be huge fan of pepper and onion -PRON- can not really make sense of -PRON- choice
the drink be okay not the good but good for the price offer
the service be not the good -PRON- server be not very friendly and do not have a stellar personality to match -PRON- profession
-PRON- could take or leave come back
love -PRON- food
-PRON- especially like lamb kachops and tandoori chicken
if -PRON- be not sure what -PRON- like try -PRON- weekend buffet -PRON- will allow -PRON- to try different dish at once
the customer service be always on point no complaint

the food be okay but the service be horrible
the table be not clean when -PRON- be seat
a girl come to clean the table with a smelly dirty rag and brush all the crumb on -PRON- lap
-PRON- ask if -PRON- would please get a clean cloth
when -PRON- come back -PRON- argue with -PRON- tell -PRON- the last one be clean
if a cloth smell enough for -PRON- to notice then -PRON- be full of bacteria and not at all clean
no wifi either
why
the waitress say -PRON- be because people stay too long
-PRON- will not be visit any applebee 's again
hand pull noodle be yummy
the layout be nice and room for large party in the back
the salsa bar with complementary chip be a blast
not truly complementary as the food and drink be not cheap for a taco shop
husband have the pork with banana leaf rice and bean on side
-PRON- leave the rice alone too full
-PRON- burro be excellent with a good flavor to the slow roast pork
-PRON- get the chicken burro with mole sauce
-PRON- be not great no taste of nut or orange
-PRON- take the flour tortilla off and mix the chicken with a little salsa
still not great
five star because -PRON- husband 's pork be good and the salsa bar be really fun
place be really busy
will come back to try something else
-PRON- use tyler 's for -PRON- linen lighting and flower arrangement for -PRON- wedding and -PRON- exceed -PRON- expectation
not only do -PRON- deliver exceptional customer service -PRON- be very informative and thorough when discuss option
-PRON- show up on time do all the set up and then return at the end of the night to pack up
the up lighting on the wall look amazing as do the chair cover and tie and the table linen
all the floral arrangemts for the wedding party and parent be stunning
bonus -PRON- make a beautiful arrangement with the leftover flower for -PRON- to display as well as rise petal for the table decor
-PRON- would highly recommend -PRON- for any service -PRON- may need
after all the hype -PRON- have high expectation
what a colossal disappointment
-PRON- friend and -PRON- be give a cozy 2-seater banquet seating
that be where the nice end
-PRON- order a rioja which be pleasant enough $ 90
-PRON- then order the ribeye to share 14 oz along with brussel sprout and wild mushroom side and the caesar salad to split and shrimp cocktail
as an aside -PRON- do not split the salad into 2 plate
several minute later -PRON- come back to clarify what -PRON- have say very clearly-
-PRON- want the ribeye 14 oz to share
-PRON- say oh -PRON- be about to order the 21 oz with the bone
right
the ribeye
while -PRON- be wait a couple sit down next to -PRON- and immediately the woman pull out -PRON- iphone and be use the flashlight to read -PRON- menu
-PRON- continue to keep -PRON- on even when the server come over to answer some question
the piercing light be insane
-PRON- mention this to -PRON- same server who think -PRON- be funny and yet when -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- be serious -PRON- be really bother -PRON- eye -PRON- refuse to do anything about -PRON-
-PRON- partner then ask if -PRON- could be relocate because this woman still have not turn off -PRON- flashlight 5 minute
one may say -PRON- be not the restaurant 's fault that -PRON- have a rude person next to -PRON- however -PRON- do not seem to think -PRON- be an issue
thing never get good
the new table -PRON- give -PRON- have glare light focus down on the table
somehow -PRON- bottle of wine get misplace and -PRON- have to ask for -PRON- glass to be refill
the steak be okay but the brown sprout and mushroom -PRON- be drown in greasy oil
-PRON- be a plate full of brown brown brown
one final assault in the woman 's washroom
the stall -PRON- be in have no toilet paper
-PRON- have to laugh -PRON- make sense
what be evident to both of -PRON- this place be try to be fine dining and fail on every level especially regard wait staff
-PRON- advice if -PRON- want a great dining experience and delicious steak go to n a o.
-PRON- do not recommend this place at all
go to this restaurant for a breakfast
when -PRON- ask for a tap water -PRON- be tell that -PRON- restaurant participate in conserve water resource and therefore will charge $ 2.00 for a bottle of tap water
please note that in all the other restaurants\/establishment that -PRON- dine to who also have a policy regard conserve water resource -PRON- do not serve tap water to customer unless -PRON- ask for -PRON-
and -PRON- free
just the same even if -PRON- do not agree to sugar factory 's explanation
-PRON- keep quiet and proceed with order 1 bottle of tap water for $ 2.00
to -PRON- surprise instead of charge -PRON- $ 2.00 for the water -PRON- charge -PRON- $ 4.00 instead
when -PRON- complaint way -PRON- bill -PRON- for $ 4.00 for 1 bottle of tap water the manager and the waitress tell -PRON- the -PRON- charge $ 2.00 per person
truly this restaurant be in the business of rip people
will never ever go back to this restaurant ever again
-PRON- specialty coffee be really delightful and smooth
-PRON- have not have -PRON- plain coffee yet
but -PRON- be willing to try -PRON- because what -PRON- have have so far make -PRON- sad to go back to starbucks
-PRON- love a good latte and -PRON- make -PRON- super foamy and with a pretty flower design on top
then -PRON- serve -PRON- in a big fat mug and -PRON- do not even need to add sugar
great place to also chill with a laptop(free wifi and study with a drink and maybe a snack
sambalatte would get 5 star if -PRON- fix -PRON- food side
-PRON- would like -PRON- if there be sign
so -PRON- could see what so and so be
when there be a long line behind -PRON- -PRON- feel bad ask the guy to explain everything to -PRON- and -PRON- have to look -PRON- up because -PRON- be not sure either
good costumer service ever great food great people 10\/10 would recommend
paco es mi mejor amigo
this be the second bridal shop -PRON- visit base on a friend 's recommendation
read the review of this shop -PRON- find -PRON- helpful and accurate
-PRON- go in with low expectation
-PRON- be not in the great neighborhood and the shop be not all fancy up even in comparison to david 's bridal but -PRON- have a ton of dress
most -PRON- have see anywhere and -PRON- seem to know -PRON- stock pretty well
so if -PRON- make an appt -PRON- can help -PRON- find what -PRON- would like
however -PRON- know exactly what -PRON- want and stick to -PRON- gun on price and style
-PRON- find -PRON- dress here and under -PRON- budget of $300
-PRON- be beautiful
-PRON- do feel a bit pressured to buy extra veil shoe etc but navigate that without too much to do
-PRON- have undivided attn
but -PRON- can see how -PRON- could easily get forget if -PRON- be busy and the friendliness seem base on sale rather than genuine excitement for -PRON-
be a good place if -PRON- keep expectation for sale and service low do not get easily frustrate and be able to stick to what -PRON- want
edc 2011 the bf and -PRON- meet up with -PRON- friend who be stay here and -PRON- have be itch to stay here since
may 2012
yelp spring break give -PRON- the perfect opportunity to finally stay at the platinum
-PRON- be extremely difficult to turn down a $ 170 weekend deal tax include no resort fee
-PRON- stay in a solitaire suite 910 sq
ft the size of a one bedroom apartment and be already impress by the basic package
each suite be build with an intuitive and efficient energy system plug -PRON- card into the light switch by the door to adjust -PRON- hvac unit take -PRON- out and the air + some light turn off plus -PRON- be a great key holder
i have no trouble find -PRON- key card each time -PRON- leave the room a balcony a living room
the size of a venetian\/palazzo suite a bedroom a beautiful bathroom and a full kitchen
the kitchen be spacious have a classy granite countertop feel and come equip with a full size fridge\/freezer -PRON- go look for the ice room on -PRON- floor but could not find one because every room come with an ice maker duh microwave coffee maker 4 stove top an oven -PRON- could have bake a cake here a set of knife not the good idea for drunk college kid and silverware and 3 type of glassware wine tall short
on top of all the amenity the service here be stellar
shortly after -PRON- check into -PRON- room and retrieve -PRON- luggage guest services call to see how -PRON- check in process go and offer to further assist with any other service
after the call -PRON- be so amazed
the next day -PRON- request for pot and an iron and -PRON- get -PRON- within 5 minute
about 5 minute after that -PRON- get another phone call from guest services follow up on -PRON- request
so amazed
valet only and unfortunately no taxi line wait outside the porte cochere
-PRON- be hardly a problem though since the platinum be a block away from the strip right behind bally 's about a 15 minute stroll
-PRON- do need to hail a taxi once and a cab arrive within 10 minute although -PRON- can take up to a half an hour wait sometimes
even without the yelp deal the usual room rate here be unbeatable for -PRON- quality and quantity
have be inside one of the suite before this visit -PRON- expect a large room but -PRON- never imagine the service to be world class as well
the platinum have become -PRON- new standard for luxury live on the strip and -PRON- doubt many place will beat -PRON- for -PRON- value
-PRON- have be see dr. padilla for nearly 10 year now
-PRON- be wonderful kind and really listen to -PRON-
the clinic as a whole be a bit assembly line but -PRON- be pretty busy
the staff could use a few lesson in be a little more kind and less impersonal
but if -PRON- can get past all that -PRON- be worth -PRON-
rock hit -PRON- windshield on the highway call around for the good pricing and these guy be a hit
set an appointment and -PRON- come and replace -PRON-
very satisfied
gas be super cheap here
some of the cheap -PRON- have find in phoenix
especially for be right off the i-10 -PRON- price be super solid
only problem be exit the place no light
so -PRON- be get back on a pretty busy street especially if -PRON- be try to make that leave back to the i-10
-PRON- just want to start off by say that -PRON- truly hate to give negative review
-PRON- typically do not write in for fast food chain but -PRON- feel -PRON- must share -PRON- experience
-PRON- go to kfc earlier this week and -PRON- kid -PRON-
not -PRON- have no chicken
-PRON- think -PRON- be a sick joke but the cashier truly seem apologetic
as dumb as -PRON- seem -PRON- go back
-PRON- order -PRON- food and the woman take -PRON- order keep give -PRON- -PRON- total before -PRON- could even finish
may -PRON- have the combo total
ok
and an order of total
as annoying as that is -PRON- finally get through
here be to the reason for the review and impede call to corporate
-PRON- use a $ 20 bill to pay for -PRON- $ 14 and change order
the woman give -PRON- -PRON- coin with honey and drop some as -PRON- say
-PRON- go to put the honey away and fish for -PRON- coin
-PRON- look up and the woman be go and window close
-PRON- wait and flag -PRON- down and ask for how much -PRON- total be again
-PRON- say oh and then give -PRON- -PRON- receipt before attempt to close the window again
-PRON- say excuse -PRON-
but -PRON- kid with a $ 20
this woman say oh yea
that be what -PRON- take out -PRON- give -PRON- -PRON- $ 5 but do not open the register meaning -PRON- have -PRON- money
-PRON- be unbelievable that -PRON- would forget change and receipt
wow
oh and -PRON- food be cold
will never be back
so great
-PRON- go for the first time a week ago
-PRON- appreciate -PRON- healthy approach to food
-PRON- have the artichoke goat cheese flatbread
so great
-PRON- husband order the ny strip off the set menu
-PRON- be perfectly cook tender and tasty
-PRON- order the sea bass
-PRON- be soooo good
absolutely delicious
great service nice atmosphere and delicious healthy food
-PRON- have find a new wonderful restaurant
reasonably price great care long hour 7 day a week
need shot
tech do that with no aptmnt fee and little to no notice
who could ask for more
so comfort and for a great cost
the food be not mind blow but just really good and with huge portion definitely worth more than the price -PRON- will pay
short line compare to los angeles
-PRON- get the fairfax sandwich and the slut
the slut be delicious even though -PRON- be pretty much a poached egg with potato in a jar and the fairfax be a sandwich with an egg
that be -PRON-

-PRON- expect more
get less
service be lackluster from the manager who deliver a breadbasket that be empty but for crumb and herb butter that be acrid with powdered garlic
-PRON- do get some bread eventually
once -PRON- server deign to drop by the table
-PRON- lack of engagement have be forewarn in repeat yelps but -PRON- be willing to overlook -PRON- for good italian however
-PRON- start with roma garden house salad with the house dressing
crisp lettuce a few crescent of red onion two wedge of decent tomato and a sprinkling of can sliced black olive all coat with a disgustingly sweet homemade dressing
-PRON- only eat a little of -PRON- 6.95 salad
dh however like the dressing compare -PRON- to poppy seed without the poppy seed
for dinner dh order chicken parmesan and -PRON- order the veal piedmontese
both be advertise as serve with pasta
dh 's oval platter have a glob of rigatoni to one side a pile of sloppy foodservice frozen veggie to the other and in the middle a bounty of tomato sauce conceal a chicken cutlet
dh say the quality of the chicken be good but the breading be slimy and sauce acidic and unbalanced
-PRON- think -PRON- entree have be microwave the heat be so intense
-PRON- be not pleased
-PRON- veal come with a white wine lemon butter sauce with canned mushroom and artichoke which be quite good and the veal be tender but flaccid and unseason
-PRON- also come with the unappealing rigatoni and frozen veggie
how much preferable to have some plain pasta like angel hair or linguini to sop up unexpectedly tasty sauce
dh eat about three bite of -PRON- chicken parm
-PRON- finish the veal and what sauce
-PRON- could scoop up
-PRON- be a very pretty restaurant with cloth tablecloth and napkin and sparkle glassware
but mediocre food and service take -PRON- off -PRON- list for a return visit
too bad
good golf course nice condition
-PRON- have lot of hill with some elevated tee box
-PRON- hit over gully a big one on the 18th hole
there be some really tough green with huge break
fun golf course
-PRON- think -PRON- be slightly overprice though
-PRON- figure to pay a lot less than -PRON- do
-PRON- walk twilight on a weekday and still have to pay a lot
but -PRON- think most people that play there have a card that provide a significant discount
-PRON- general tso 's chicken be pretty nasty
-PRON- keep bite into piece of chicken that be so chewy -PRON- just chew on -PRON- for about half a minute until -PRON- finally spit -PRON- out
the white rice be not bad but -PRON- be starve and the chicken turn -PRON- off
overall a good first experience
-PRON- server be not very familiar with the menu and be unable to answer -PRON- question without retreat to the sushi bar area where -PRON- could ask someone that know
the food be good and come out in an acceptable amount of time
sushi be fresh and portion be good in relation to price
-PRON- be a little far from where -PRON- live
and -PRON- probably would not make the trip just to eat here
if -PRON- be in the area -PRON- may be different
-PRON- have eat at probably all the fine place las vegas have to offer and i have to say -PRON- do not expect a bad experience with this one especially after read the review
pro
nice staff
cons
nice staff but -PRON- particular waiter lack menu knowledge
pros nicely decorate restaurant cons sushi overfill with rice and have no special taste
by the time -PRON- have -PRON- third roll -PRON- figure may as well just load up on drink because -PRON- be get no excitement with the food
drink be mediocre
in conclusion more con then pro
not recommend
go to social house instead way better in all aspect
this be a spa but -PRON- come here for weight loss
in 4 month -PRON- be down 43 pound
rmms provide the tool and motivation to succeed
be -PRON- expensive
every diet be so get over -PRON-
the entire staff be helpful care and awesome
-PRON- only complaint be about the liquid diet flavor option
somewhat limited and always out or low on the good flavor
the service be consistently bad the store be usually dirty and -PRON- can not think of a good thing to say about -PRON-
think -PRON- through if -PRON- be willing to forego a level of service and environment for the good price then -PRON- could find item here at a low price
however -PRON- get what -PRON- pay for
also as -PRON- son find out to -PRON- dismay after purchase a pre pay gaming card with a damage strip and come back an hour later these type of purchase be final sale and -PRON- be force to track down the appropriate number to call the vendor
everyone in the office be extremely friendly and there to help
go in hardly know what insurance be or what -PRON- be buy and leave with a total understanding of what -PRON- be cover for
-PRON- feel the agent be be really honest with -PRON- with what -PRON- could expect from geico and what -PRON- really need to protect -PRON-
-PRON- be not try to pad -PRON- rate by over insure -PRON- like most agent would and give -PRON- plenty of option to choose from
-PRON- save a ton of money buy an awesome product from true professional who know what -PRON- be talk about
-PRON- even get emergency road side for way less than what -PRON- be pay with aaa
save more money all around
-PRON- have not have an agent -PRON- have trust and have have negative experience with every other company -PRON- have try
so if -PRON- want to save money and actually know what -PRON- be pay for give -PRON- a call -PRON- be the nice ever and will really help -PRON- out

so glad -PRON- switch
-PRON- would give 10 star if -PRON- could
live music and great staff
the service be good the drink be awesome
-PRON- have a band every night and -PRON- change up the band every week

mgm grand
-PRON- will not be disappoint -PRON- promise
the food be fantastic -PRON- be quite surprised to find the atmosphere to be so comfortable
-PRON- would highly recommend this place to anyone even though the food be very pricey for what -PRON- get
-PRON- have be to other pita jungles
and -PRON- be all pretty similar this one be the good experience though
waitress be attentive and kind and answer question thoroughly and nice
if -PRON- be on the edge -PRON- recommend this pita jungle for dinner tonight
if -PRON- like sour this be -PRON- place
-PRON- have a great variety that range from hoppy to light and with -PRON- sampler option -PRON- be easy to find one that -PRON- love
-PRON- have have great interaction with the staff member very friendly and helpful
-PRON- system for waiting table include allow the customer to change the card on the table to signify when -PRON- need service or -PRON- check
as -PRON- put -PRON- so -PRON- do not bother -PRON- too much or too little -PRON- think that be great
-PRON- let -PRON- sit and talk uninterrupted but also get -PRON- service promptly when need
-PRON- do not get any food but the menu be interesting to -PRON-
if -PRON- do not already have dinner plan -PRON- would have try something
-PRON- be look forward to return in the warm weather the outdoor space be gorgeous and
-PRON- be sure will be great on a warm evening
love this little place

once in a while -PRON- pick up food to go so -PRON- can not speak on the dining experience
but -PRON- can say the food be good
frederick be -PRON- first taste of hakka cuisine and definitely will not be -PRON- last
-PRON- always order the chilli chicken chicken\/fish pakora and the chilli green bean not sure what -PRON- be call
-PRON- taste like chinese food kick up a notch with more spice and flavour
the green bean be the big surprise
-PRON- be not a huge fan of green bean but -PRON- be so good
a nice blend of sweet and spicy
-PRON- actually google the recipe and make -PRON- because -PRON- be that good
-PRON- live here for a total of 4 year and would have stay if -PRON- be not purchase a home
-PRON- be locate on spring mountain and decatur which be pretty close to the strip
-PRON- be in the middle of chinatown and have alot of food place to eat at
this be -PRON- favorite part of -PRON- location since -PRON- be a big foodie
-PRON- be pretty close to the 215 and 115 so about a 10 15min drive either way
so get to work be not an issue
one negative thing -PRON- could say be that -PRON- wish be that there be a little more storage space but -PRON- have the one -PRON- can rent out as well
-PRON- just never decide to use -PRON-
anyways -PRON- still recommend -PRON- to friend and family as -PRON- never have an issue
the grass and tree be a nice touch since -PRON- do not really find these thing in vegas
good place to walk -PRON- doggie
on 2 occasion -PRON- teriyaki chicken bowl have a small chicken bone in -PRON-
rather than die a painful death -PRON- decide to stop eat there
do not really recommend
this location have issue
roll up at 5:30 look to purchase 12 piece family meal mild
could not fill the order
only have 3 piece of mild
5:30pm at a chicken restaurant do not have enough chicken
insane

-PRON- listen to what -PRON- want and do not make -PRON- feel like -PRON- be ask too much
-PRON- love -PRON- hair and -PRON- will definitely be go back to -PRON-
brunch be outstanding absolutely the way to go
menu provide a wide assortment of fantastic dish all worth try
most memorable dish seranno ham waffle steak and egg and huevos ranchero
service be questionable at first but soon then take a turn for the good as the plate be come faster than -PRON- could eat -PRON-
at $ 35 this brunch have a lot of value
-PRON- would go back without hesitation
as with any las vegas experience sw steakhouse be over the top and outrageously good
choose to remain at the bar as oppose to take a table -PRON- and a friend must have spend 3 + hour sip taste and socialize in the bar
nothing against the restaurant dining room which be like most any other fine dining room in las vegas but sometimes -PRON- really kill the buzz to sit down for a quiet dinner when -PRON- be in the mood just to have a good time
so instead -PRON- sit at the bar and socialize -PRON- way through various appetizer entree and bottle of wine
the chill jumbo shrimp cocktail be out of this world
of course so be the price at $ 20 but -PRON- be vegas after all
nothing come cheep so be prepared to spend
-PRON- also have a caprese type dish which be disappointing because of the mushy tomato but -PRON- do not even know if -PRON- be on the menu
so that be probably just what -PRON- get
make up for that mistake -PRON- order the filet with blue cheese that be amazing as well
the wine list be extensive specifically focus on big red from california italy and france
-PRON- have a bottle of shafer merlot and a brunello
this be the second bottle
so the name escape -PRON-
overall -PRON- experience be quite enjoyable as -PRON- be sure the bartender hostess and any guest pass through the bar could attest to
enjoy

the sauteed onion and hash brown under the patie be awesome

-PRON- do like the various food option available include b spot for a burger

however -PRON- do encounter one rude staff member
-PRON- 58 year old mother have already walk down to the flat water kayaking dock

and there be no way -PRON- would be able to climb that hill twice
so the employee give -PRON- hell -PRON- be convince that -PRON- be try to get around -PRON- paperwork
-PRON- suggest that -PRON- would run the paperwork down to -PRON- mother and then back up before anybody ever get in a kayak

good service reasonable price and delicious food
love -PRON-
-PRON- have be take class from dawn for over a year now
-PRON- start with line dancing class
-PRON- be able to break the dance down enough for beginner to follow but also keep the class move along so that more advanced dancer could still enjoy the class
then -PRON- try -PRON- pilate and body sculpting class and soon become addicted
first of all -PRON- drop in rate be unbeatable
-PRON- class be significantly cheap than any of the other yoga studio in town
-PRON- low monthly rate which require no commitment be also a great deal
dawn be a wonderful instructor
-PRON- be very invest in all -PRON- student and love to see -PRON- progress
the studio be a very comfortable setting
the class be small so -PRON- get more attention
the other student be also very friendly and not intimidate
the fitness class be very effective
-PRON- finally have muscle definition and have also be able to reach and maintain -PRON- goal weight
cool place
the brat slider be delicious
sooo many beer to choose from
also -PRON- can fill growler
just like with pretty much any other gym
-PRON- be tough to get a good workout in between 4 6 unless -PRON- do not plan on use any of the machine or bench to do so
parking be also a nightmare around this time
-PRON- have only one room where -PRON- conduct fitness class but the instructor be pretty good and a usually on time
-PRON- have a lady only fitness area which not to many other golds gyms do
the people that come here be here to work out and not for a fashion show well there be always 1 or 2
but -PRON- be not as bad as lvac where most people come to see and be see
-PRON- have a mixed martial arts\/boxing arena -PRON- have to extra for those class
but -PRON- be a cool addition
-PRON- have a childcare center which -PRON- believe be very inexpensive
the price of membership be 20\/m for full use include all class 30 if -PRON- want to use -PRON- tanning booth
the stand tanning booth be just ok but for only 10extra\/m for unlimited tanning -PRON- can not beat -PRON-
do -PRON- mention there be no contract
there be also no cancellation penalty
the staff be friendly and helpful and the bathroom be always clean
-PRON- have be a member of lvac and while -PRON- be a very sexy fitness center sexy do not always translate to good especially if -PRON- be tie to a contract
this place be clean and have plenty of seating when -PRON- arrive
the waitress be polite and seat -PRON- quickly
-PRON- order the cognac duck chicken katsu bowl and the caterpillar roll
the first two come with a good portion of rice and -PRON- do not seem too long for the food to come out
-PRON- offer a free thai iced tea for check in on yelp and allow multiple of -PRON- to claim the offer some place only allow 1 per group
the cognac duck be delicious
-PRON- come with pepper pineapple slice green and a really tasty sauce that can be pour over -PRON- rice to enhance the flavor
-PRON- alone make the trip here worth -PRON-
-PRON- brother order the chicken katsu bowl which be tasty but overall nothing special
-PRON- come with -PRON- own bowl of rice and sauce
-PRON- have a variety of roll but -PRON- go with the caterpillar roll
-PRON- have thick piece of avocado on top with eel
even -PRON- brother who do not like eel say -PRON- be not bad
-PRON- be kind of hard to hold onto with the chopstick though
overall -PRON- be a pleasant dining experience
if -PRON- could only recommend one dish -PRON- would definitely be the cognac duck hand down
-PRON- frequent this establishment year ago however the quality begin to lapse
so -PRON- move on
-PRON- pick up a groupon a few week ago to give -PRON- another try
well even at the discount -PRON- be not worth -PRON-
the service be still lackluster the quality of the work leave much to be desire
-PRON- will not be come back anytime soon
this be hand down the good place to buy good organic produce especially if -PRON- a do not have access to farmer market b can not afford to shop at whole food and d prefer happy helpful employee over jaded teenager or pretentious hippie
the nachos be very good
-PRON- also try the cheese quesadilla which be very tasty
the only problem be the server denise be super pushy for -PRON- to settle up on the bill because -PRON- be get off soon
kind of weird
$ 5 all -PRON- can eat 2 week old chinese leftover
or that be what -PRON- taste like anyway
yummy
-PRON- be beyond upset over the service that -PRON- receive upon book a hotel reservation at this hotel
when -PRON- reserve the room -PRON- be tell over the phone that the price would be $ 143.99 by caroline
when -PRON- check -PRON- bank account -PRON- be actually charge $ 203.29
confused -PRON- call the reservation desk back and caroline advise that -PRON- would have to transfer -PRON- to the front counter in order to be assist
after 6 minute of wait on hold -PRON- advise that no one be available to take -PRON- call
-PRON- offer to take down -PRON- information and call -PRON- back at a later time
when -PRON- call -PRON- back about thirty minute later -PRON- explain that -PRON- do not know the reason for the $ 203.29 charge on -PRON- account but that the full dollar amount would be refund
great
but
-PRON- forget to mention that in addition to the initial charge of $ 203.29 -PRON- would be charge -PRON- the actual amount of the room plus tax in fee which turn out to be an additional $ 162.71
that mean all together -PRON- account have be debit a grand total of $ 366
do -PRON- have a refund
nope
could -PRON- speak to a manager about -PRON-
absolutely not
instead -PRON- transfer to -PRON- to -PRON- voicemail and assure -PRON- that -PRON- would receive a response this evening
what actually happen be that -PRON- end up call thirty minute later -PRON- get caroline back on the phone who transfer -PRON- to the front desk only to be tell that that she leave for the day
seriously
the confirmation email literally say luxury shin at aliante and -PRON- look forward to give -PRON- an experience that be bright than ever
if there be anything -PRON- need please do not hesitate to ask
cheers to hop the manager
actually call -PRON- back tomorrow to give -PRON- an experience bright than ever
-PRON- doubt -PRON-
-PRON- consider shanghai dim sum one of the rise player of shanghai cuisine in the greater toronto area
this place have one of the good siu long baos soup fill dumplings that -PRON- have ever eat
the dumpling be prepare fresh make to order since the soup inside the dumpling can burn -PRON- tongue
-PRON- make the classic rookie mistake even let -PRON- cool for at least a minute
the other choice -PRON- have green onion pancake shanghai fried noodles fried rice be just as delicious as the soup fill dumpling
the service be questionable at best
the waiter be not as attentive as -PRON- should be
even if -PRON- ask -PRON- for just a refill on tea do not be surprised for a long wait
the price for the dish be more than reasonable
-PRON- will get value for any dish -PRON- order
-PRON- will definitely be back for more especially for -PRON- dumpling
the service be questionable but the food will make up for -PRON-
the never end quest to find the good sushi in the gta bring -PRON- to this out of the way spot time and time again
-PRON- usually depend on a ride from -PRON- drool omakase craze friend for a ride to newmarket but this never take long than a few second of suggestion to get -PRON- to comply
yes to quote the cliche -PRON- be worth the drive to newmarket
solo sushi ya be in a nondescript little building way the heck out in middle of nowhere and be own and operate by a mild sushi nazi
legend have -PRON- that -PRON- have chide many a folk when -PRON- unwittingly order mundane concoction like sushi pizza and other fast foody sushi at -PRON- establishment declare -PRON- an insult to -PRON- fine skill
master jyo be not far off base with -PRON- chiding -PRON- tell ya
once -PRON- have eat here -PRON- will almost never eat at another one of those mass sushi house or gasp all -PRON- can eat sushi buffet place ever again
at a not unreasonable $ 55 for omakase every dish of prepared food and sashimi as well as sushi be expertly prepared
-PRON- be impossible to find a weak spot here
all the prepared food be gorgeously present change often with the season and sup tasty
likewise the sashimi and sushi plate be supremely fresh and expertly cut like how the god intend and far from hack off piece of raw fish that -PRON- may get at less establishment
-PRON- learn quickly that sashimi be not merely cut up piece of raw fish and there be a great deal of care and thought put into the selection and cut of the sashimi
on -PRON- most recent visit the main prepared dish find a steam put of gen kani a bizarre hairy crab soup\/stew load with fresh veggie simmer in a sweet briny broth not sweet like sugar but sweet like flavourful
wonderful
eat the hairy crab be an usual experience but more than worth the effort for the sweet delicate flesh
-PRON- can not say enough about solo sushi ya each visit be a whole new amazing experience and probably some of the good japanese cuisine one can sample without fly all the way to tokyo
go on a groupon today for the first time
-PRON- be greet by two guy who tell -PRON- that -PRON- windshield be in such horrible condition that -PRON- may break go through the carwash and -PRON- have to replace -PRON- -PRON- insurance would pay for -PRON-
-PRON- windshield be in great shape just try to commit insurance fraud
-PRON- be a hard hard sell
when -PRON- say no for about the 6th time -PRON- say fine guess -PRON- would rather replace -PRON- than get -PRON- fix for free
-PRON- take 5 second to get a windshield salesman but 5 minute for somebody to finally come up to help -PRON- get -PRON- car wash and oil change
talk about a bad first impression
next -PRON- have to wait for over an hour to get a simple oil change and car wash
the waiting room be sparse but do have a nice aquarium
finally even though -PRON- have a $ 22 groupon that should have cover the cost -PRON- charge -PRON- $ 5 extra for random thing like $ 1 fee for suv -PRON- be a hyundai tucson other service fee and tax
-PRON- do not have as bad of an experience as luis t but -PRON- be bad enough that -PRON- will never be back
nothing really stand out to -PRON- when -PRON- try about 5 of -PRON- sushi roll
in general -PRON- be a good place to eat but if -PRON- be look to for amazing food
-PRON- would go somewhere else
-PRON- survive the ride without be seriously injure
as the roller coaster be move out of the station a young lady wait in line spot that -PRON- safety harness be not secure
and -PRON- scream at the attendant to stop the roller coaster
-PRON- could not believe the attendant do not check each rider to see if -PRON- safety harness be properly secure
the roller coaster feel a lot more extreme than space mountain in disneyland and -PRON- really feel like -PRON- be go be eject from the ride
the g force be extreme and the ride feel very rough and jerky
-PRON- end get some mild bruising on -PRON- shoulder
after the ride there be even an area which customer could register -PRON- personal information in -PRON- database if -PRON- develop injury from the roller coaster ride
-PRON- purchase an outdoor gas fireplace and outdoor grill for the price -PRON- get from creative design for just the grill
great quality and incredible price
-PRON- be deliver tomorrow and -PRON- can not wait to enjoy -PRON- both
kokomos be outstanding
-PRON- have eat here a couple of time since -PRON- be close in distance from where -PRON- live also the food be great and healthy since -PRON- be vegan and do not eat out much
the problem -PRON- have be the service be terrible every time -PRON- have to ask for what have dairy or gluten every time and the cashier look at -PRON- like like a deer in headlight take out a white binder from under the desk and take forever to figure -PRON- out
-PRON- just get really old do not know how many more chance -PRON- can give
maaaaaan this place be goooood
so -PRON- call in an order and pick up the carne asada tostada and a chicken quesadilla from this place
-PRON- be great the tostada be crispy and not stale have a ton of meat the tostada pack in a bunch of flavor
and the red sauce be perfect with the chicken quesadilla
lot of cheese and chicken and -PRON- tortilla be great
-PRON- usually rate a mexican joint on how great -PRON- tortilla be and let -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- be way up there
-PRON- will be come back to try a bunch more from -PRON- huge selection
great facility have more equipment than other clubs
very convenient open 24 hr
amazing training staff -PRON- really help -PRON- with the machine and with -PRON- back injury
staff very friendly highly recommend
-PRON- be now leave without a car as the insurance total -PRON- car
and -PRON- be leave with a small sum of money which be not enough to buy another car
and all this because -PRON- take -PRON- car to roy foss to fix -PRON- and -PRON- test drive -PRON- and meet with an accident
what be more -PRON- refuse to pay the towing charge from the scene of the accident and allow -PRON- car to get impound
now -PRON- have to file a claim on -PRON- policy to get -PRON- car take care of which mean that now i have a claim on -PRON- insurance which will increase -PRON- premium
-PRON- ask roy foss in good faith to get -PRON- car fix and handle this out of insurance but -PRON- refuse
what be more -PRON- be rude with -PRON- especially peter recine and the james foss ricci and -PRON- ignore -PRON- and -PRON- call
be this what have become of the world today
-PRON- go to a dealership because of the customer service and look at what -PRON- get- -PRON- get into an accident with -PRON- car and -PRON- want -PRON- to deal with -PRON- own insurance and take care of thing
what be more frustrating be that-
-PRON- do not even provide -PRON- a rental car while all this be go
on-
all roy foss do be try to save every penny on this and try not to spend anything on -PRON- even though -PRON- be the one who cause this mess
-PRON- ask -PRON- hey give -PRON- a good deal on another use car and peter recine refuse
this roy foss dealership need to be avoid at all cost
no customer should go here or get service from this place
-PRON- wander into rudy off the street in the pour rain one night and could not have be more pleased with -PRON- luck
-PRON- order the valentino with a side of fry which without exaggeration be the good fry chicken sandwich -PRON- have ever have
on top of this the staff be incredibly friendly
-PRON- come into the restaurant alone and -PRON- strike up a conversation with -PRON- point -PRON- towards -PRON- favourite spot to go when visit toronto
overall -PRON- experience at rudy be fantastic and -PRON- plan on go back every time -PRON- be in the city again
-PRON- be surprised how much this location stand out to -PRON-
-PRON- will usually go out of -PRON- way to shop here over most other place
-PRON- be so accommodate
-PRON- never push an item on -PRON- that be out of -PRON- budget
deal be plentiful and -PRON- staff will actually highlight something -PRON- may have miss
-PRON- get 4 pie for a get together
apple cherry peach and chocolate cream
pie be freshly make
peach be delicious
all other be good too as many people at gathering ask where do -PRON- get these pie from
-PRON- have a good time here
-PRON- sort of stand on -PRON- own opposite a beer shop and a few other little store
blue moon be on offer for around $ 4 for a large glass there be a wonderful server who be only too happy to help with any question -PRON- have
food be superb -PRON- friend and -PRON- have boneless wing chip queso and a pastrami sandwich
the two veggie option for sandwich be great a tuna one and a double cheese with egg sort of thing
both look great
the sandwich be serve with a bunch of cheese slaw tomato and fry on the sandwich -PRON- sort of superb chip butty for -PRON- brit out there
the pricing be more than reasonable and people be in and out of here all afternoon
-PRON- seem busy and -PRON- do not deal with a bad member of staff
for what -PRON- be -PRON- be a great restaurant
very disappointed
-PRON- usually do not like to review base on service but this be bad
-PRON- be tell 5 min plenty of open table 2 ppl in front of -PRON-
wait almost 30 min as the entry way fill w ppl all wonder what be go on
once seat take a while to get coffee and order
have the freedom toast which come out semi warm very little cheese\/meat mostly bread
-PRON- husband have the chicken and waffle the poach egg be cook through and there be very little gravy
needless to say -PRON- be very dry
-PRON- have wait so long and could not get anyone 's attention
so -PRON- just eat
other who order the same thing look very different -PRON- think -PRON- just be unfortunate with -PRON- server\/cook
definitely have potential could have be great but be far from -PRON- today
let -PRON- start off by say ultimately -PRON- do not get -PRON- dress here however -PRON- could not have ask for a good experience for -PRON- first dress try on session
hailey and -PRON- team be so incredibly attentive and kind and help -PRON- narrow down what -PRON- like and ultimately what would make -PRON- feel -PRON- good on -PRON- wedding day
any local restaurant that serve a healthy side salad aka
not iceberg lettuce in pittsburgh get at least 4 star from -PRON-
the village t t be a cozy little place with hard wood booth and table
the menu serve traditional italian fare
-PRON- order the zucchini parm special and -PRON- mom order the chicken romano
the zucchini be good but the chicken be out of this world
and as state before the side salad have no iceberg lettuce at all
score
the only advice -PRON- would give be to have one waitress per table
even though the waitress be very nice -PRON- have two two come to the table to take -PRON- order and -PRON- seem to switch off duty throughout the meal
-PRON- just feel a bit crowded and -PRON- feel more pressure to order quickly because there be two people wait to take -PRON- order
-PRON- husband and -PRON- be really picky
and -PRON- love 5th and wine
the atmosphere be fun and hip
the employee be so gracious and eager to please
-PRON- sit at the bar and be instantly intrigue by carl the fabulous bartender
-PRON- suggest a pinot noir that be not the most expensive and -PRON- be fabulous
-PRON- also suggest the flight of bruschetta and -PRON- palette want to thank -PRON-
the french fry be make with garlic very yummy
love -PRON- and will definitely return
wait over an hour for delivery through uber eat
have high hope but food fall flat
-PRON- be huge pad
thai lover and have try -PRON- all over the city and throughout thailand
this pad thai be very sub par
dry noodle and artificial taste
definitely no tamarind flavour
and -PRON- could swear -PRON- could taste that undesirable ketchup taste
mango salad fry rice and spring roll be good
pad thai be simple and should be fool proof with good high quality ingredient but -PRON- miss the mark on -PRON- here unfortunately
have be twice already this summer
and -PRON- be test out the delivery from pizza brutta
if -PRON- love mushroom the cremini pizza be definitely the good pizza -PRON- will ever taste
love the stone oven in the restaurant staff very nice
delivery on time with delicious pizza
locate in the super cute distillery historic district
-PRON- walk in on a hot day and -PRON- have all kind of goody
lot of different kind of chocolate and gelato
one thing that be off put -PRON- swear the place smell like foot maybe -PRON- be the customer who know
ew
but otherwise -PRON- appear to be very clean and the staff be friendly
since -PRON- be -PRON- first time in there -PRON- go simple milk chocolate square
boy be -PRON- good
perfectly melty in -PRON- mouth and very creamy
good enough when -PRON- finish -PRON-
-PRON- be sad that -PRON- live in boston
and -PRON- be in toronto
-PRON- check -PRON- website no buying online right now -PRON- hope -PRON- add that soon
-PRON- call flores base on -PRON- good review and -PRON- be pretty much blow off
initially no one answer the phone
and -PRON- leave a message
-PRON- take a few day for -PRON- to call back but then -PRON- schedule a time to come over the next day before noon to look at the unit
the next morning no one show up
-PRON- call -PRON- at 12:30 to ask where -PRON- be and learn that -PRON- have not even schedule -PRON-
-PRON- seem very disorganized and do not care that -PRON- have lose a morning wait for -PRON-
-PRON- say -PRON- have to check to see if anyone could come today and that -PRON- should wait
-PRON- say to not bother and neither should -PRON-
this hotel be far from lv but -PRON- be here on a company vacation which mean a lot of time in the conference room and the rest on pool or restaurant
there be not much to do around here
there be the lake or the long drive to the strip or the dam
the food be excellent as be the service
-PRON- like the room and the chance to get away from lv before actually hit lv
-PRON- have some problem with housekeeping but those be quickly resolve by the front desk
the bed and the pillow be actually quite comfortable
this do not really compare too well to other westins but -PRON- do not disappoint
great burger

-PRON- will definitely be try the priest the next time i visit
mushroom cheese deep friend and top on a beef patty with bacon chesse

have the egg benedict which be simply yummy
-PRON- will definitely be back
be curious to try after read raving review
yes -PRON- be true
banh mi burger -PRON- be worth the walk from -PRON- hotel
-PRON- be all that as per other have described- nice blend of good tasty exotic and unique ness
-PRON- only suggestion for -PRON- would be to switch to or let the customer choose a small or thin bun that can bring out the unique taste even bold better
on the other hand -PRON- be very disappointed with the kimchi fire
even if -PRON- be stir fry or grill kimchi should bring out some sour y taste to indulge -PRON- tastebud which could have make this a home run side menu
however the non korean kimchi use here make this item nothing special
the food be very nice
however the service be horrendous
-PRON- place 3 order for food
every one of -PRON- be extremely wrong despite confirm what -PRON- order with the waitress before -PRON- leave the table
after this -PRON- order desert which just never come
the waitress also pay almost no attention to -PRON- table even get water refill be a struggle
to add insult to injury -PRON- be charge a mandatory tip on -PRON- table of two people
will never be return
-PRON- can not say enough about johan at wheeler ac
-PRON- arrive on time even early
today be extremely polite and very helpful with resolve -PRON- ac issue
-PRON- go out of -PRON- way to check out a situation that result in save -PRON- hundred of dollar a year in cooling and heating cost
johan be a great employee to work with
would not recommend asian american realty to anyone
rude dishonest and unprofessional
top dog grooming be the good place -PRON- have be too so far
after -PRON- dog have be turn down at other place for be shorter temper and -PRON- be tell that -PRON- just need to be train more because -PRON- be too aggressive and a list of other thing that be ridiculous
-PRON- know not every dog be go to sit there perfectly and -PRON- also know guinness be not an angel but if -PRON- feel the need to be aggressive there be probably a good reason
top dog take guinness in and -PRON- come up to the groomer -PRON- can not remember -PRON- name wonderful woman -PRON- be lick -PRON- hand and -PRON- jump up on the wall to say hi
-PRON- have never see -PRON- do that before
the energy inside be so positive
-PRON- will never take -PRON- dog anywhere else
the kitchen hour be tue fri 10am-4pm and sat 10am-2pm
-PRON- be really excited to try -PRON- food as -PRON- boyfriend be in dire need of a sandwich
and -PRON- also have vegan option
however -PRON- be give a business card by someone at -PRON- thomas road location which have the wrong hour on -PRON- and -PRON- be tell -PRON- kitchen have close at 4 p.m. and not 5 p.m. as the old business card state

-PRON- would say this place be average
-PRON- get the eggplant and chicken sandwhich $ 7 and change

while the poeple behind the counter be not especially nice -PRON- do have an italian charm to -PRON- that make -PRON- smile
now -PRON- unwrap -PRON- delightful sandwich but the flavour be less than a taste explosion
maybe -PRON- be too spoiled with the ridiculously fatty sauce -PRON- put on everything these day but there be something very bland about the topping
however if -PRON- pick apart the sandwhich and eat -PRON- one ingredient at a time -PRON- be rather good
the chicken ad eggplant
fab
the bread-
-PRON- never order white bread anymore let alone a kaiser bun
but i have to say the pedestrian nature of -PRON- be a pleasant experience
the tomato sauce be good
and -PRON- do not load any spice not even pepper or salt to season any of the toppings\/ingredient
-PRON- be a simple and decent sandwhich
that being say -PRON- would not go again

have fun
this spot have be around for quite sometime
-PRON- be a pretty great bookstore that have be a staple in richmond hill next to silver city since -PRON- be in -PRON- early teen
-PRON- know -PRON- be standard to most other location but one of the thing -PRON- love about this place be the large amount of comfortable seating conveniently place throughout the store to relax and enjoy a warm beverage compliment of the in house starbucks
certainly one of -PRON- favourite secret spot to come and relax on a cool fall or cold winters day
a great place for a family or maybe even a unique date stop
the starbucks inside also have a great selection of seating but if -PRON- be plan to use this place to do some work as -PRON- commonly do -PRON- will be remiss to find a suitable wall jack to plug in for power there be a couple

the location of the restaurant be great the lightrail be right in front of -PRON-
depend on what -PRON- take -PRON- can have a positive exsperience
if -PRON- stay away from everything -PRON- cook or prepare -PRON- can do well
-PRON- stay away from -PRON- baked good and prepared salad and anything -PRON- whip up
-PRON- only take fresh vegetable and dressing and a soggy sweet potato
service be poor the day -PRON- be there
maybe -PRON- be short staff
nobody clear -PRON- plate or tray
-PRON- eat here because this sweet tomatoes be locate close to the musical instrument museum and the mim cafe be way too expensive for family dining
-PRON- nephew and niece like -PRON- and take many plate of food
sweet tomatoes -PRON- be what -PRON- be
if -PRON- have not be outside of ohio -PRON- will convince -PRON- that this be a nice beach

be there any way -PRON- can not love princes street gardens
one of the good place for people watch in the world these beautiful floral garden be one of edinburgh 's most famous feature
dot with probably close to 200 bench -PRON- be a great meeting place for -PRON- be location and when -PRON- be sunny can be a great place to lie on the grass and enjoy some ray
the gardens be also home to a fantastic fair at christmastime
that have half the garden jam pack with stall sell cotton candy to authentic polish fast food a plethora of ride from the ferris wheel to the swing that -PRON- be always absolutely terrified be go to throw -PRON- off and more tourist flock to -PRON- than probably anywhere else in the city

cho sun ok have a unique taste to -PRON- meal that make -PRON- want to come back over and over again particularly -PRON- pork bone soup and -PRON- bibimbap
the restaurant be very well run despite the large volume of customer
from -PRON- experience -PRON- be good to go after 1pm and before 5pm to avoid the rush
this place be incredibly clean and the quality of -PRON- meal be consistent which be something that -PRON- highly value as a return guest
-PRON- usually get the pork bone soup which come with a side of purple rice and load of meat in the soup
-PRON- cold bowl bibimbap be plentiful and colourful which again remain the same every time -PRON- come back
-PRON- will say that -PRON- be not a huge fan of -PRON- side dish
despite the large quantity something about these dish lack quality that -PRON- usually observe at other korean restaurant
however this do not stop -PRON- from come back every time
overall -PRON- enjoy come back to the same meal every time
and -PRON- have not be disappoint since -PRON- start in 2015
frendly staff quick lunch service with average flavor and quality
-PRON- obviously prep the food ahead of time for fast service buy
-PRON- would rather wait a little long for fresh food
the price on -PRON- website be not current so expect to pay a bit more
for this place to stand out -PRON- either need to lower -PRON- price or prepare each order individually
great addition to town square

unfortunately the size -PRON- request to have put on hold do not fit but -PRON- have a few at caesars palace
the sale associate be helpful and ask if there be anything else -PRON- may want to look at
-PRON- decline
so -PRON- say -PRON- could have caesars palace put the item -PRON- want on hold
and -PRON- could pick -PRON- up later
this tiffany location have the friendly sale associate and -PRON- would go back again
the arrangement of the store and staff make -PRON- an open and invite environment

-PRON- do seat -PRON- after a minute or so and -PRON- have a drink and a bowl of soup before -PRON- have finish -PRON- set up
-PRON- will also admit that the hot and sour soup be a bit disappointing be not dark brown in color and taste very bland
however the general tsos may be the good -PRON- have have since move to cleveland over 15 year ago
white meat perfectly fry and with a nice assortment of veggie

and -PRON- be dang near impossible to hear what be be say thru the speaker so -PRON- repeat -PRON- order yesterday to be sure -PRON- would know what -PRON- want
replace the speaker guy
otherwise -PRON- be good
visit this place soon after -PRON- open on the recommendation of a friend
what a surprise
and not a good one
the carne taco be waay expensive
$ 3.75 per taco
travel extensively to most all region of mexico so -PRON- have see many variation on the theme of taco
these be some version of caucasian tacos
the carne have a slightly sweet flavor like the get the meat from joe 's bbq
tortillas be soft and pretty good
many flavor of iced tea
not say that be good or bad but hey
focus on one good one and stick with -PRON-
the place be pretty trendy and remind -PRON- of what a taco shop at the biltmore would look like
but -PRON- be clean and pleasing
crowd be full of local with man buns
urban chic -PRON- guess
-PRON- sit at the bar and -PRON- smell like a bar
no big deal
take a while for uno taco so when -PRON- do arrive -PRON- jump right in
do not notice a salsa bar
like -PRON- say slightly sweet flavor not what -PRON- be look for as -PRON- be look for authentic
and -PRON- be honest when the waiter come and ask -PRON- how -PRON- be
sat and enjoy the view and finish -PRON- tea
when -PRON- ask for the check the guy say that -PRON- be comp and -PRON- be sorry for the dis appoint taco
-PRON- graciously thank -PRON- and leave almost the total bill for a tip
and for -PRON- be popularity
-PRON- guess -PRON- be not the authenticity that people come here for
and that be ok too
great ambiance mostly attentive staff and food be so so
felt for the price the food be a little underwhelming
have the elk chop not that great
wished -PRON- have have a different dish
the pizza kitchen be locate on the corner of hacienda and s.fort apache
-PRON- be in the walmart plaza
easy to find
-PRON- arrive there around 6 p.m. for dinner
-PRON- be the only people there for a few minute and then a few more customer cam in
-PRON- be not that busy for a wednesday night at dinner time
-PRON- stand in line while -PRON- prepare -PRON- pizza just like -PRON- be at a sandwich shop or a burrito spot
after -PRON- pick all of -PRON- topping -PRON- go in the oven and -PRON- go sit down
when the pizza be cook a server bring -PRON- to -PRON- table
$ 8.00 for unlimited topping be great
-PRON- have plenty of fresh topping to choose from
unfortunately the be out of whole wheat dough
-PRON- lose one star for run out of product
the pizza crust be very thin so -PRON- cook quickly
-PRON- also have vegan cheese meat and gluten free dough
overall the pizza be good the service be good and the place look clean
if -PRON- in the area -PRON- would stop by and try this place
-PRON- need negative star
walk into this branch again with 15 people in line and be greet by the greeter up front which be a stupid and absolutely useless position
-PRON- ask how -PRON- could help and -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- need to hire another teller like usual
-PRON- say this be the way bank of america be make all of -PRON- branch
-PRON- want all of -PRON- branch to have shitty customer service
what a bunch of idiot
corporate -PRON- be a bunch of idiot also
go in on a not so busy saturday morning to change over -PRON- winter to -PRON- all season tire be not expect the 33 price increase from $ 60 last year to $ 80 this year
-PRON- tire be not on rim
-PRON- be tell that -PRON- go up
at least -PRON- do not wait that long for the change over and customer service be friendly
food be great atmosphere be pretty good as well
big down fall be the service first -PRON- receive the wrong order
-PRON- then take -PRON- awhile to get -PRON- bill
even with the bad service -PRON- will still go back
fyi -PRON- have update this review only because -PRON- go to las vegas in august of 2009 and notice that -PRON- price have go up
-PRON- still beat a cab for go along the strip
this be -PRON- preferred method of transportation when -PRON- visit vegas and want to stay along the strip
this bus do go just north of fremont street all the way down south to the terminal by the airport
-PRON- would not recommend take -PRON- anymore north of the stratosphere though
las vegas seem to just get kind of weird in the area
north of the stratosphere along las vegas blvd
have that say if -PRON- want to visit fremont street which -PRON- guess be cool to see at least once -PRON- would take a taxicab
-PRON- have no interest in do this
why
-PRON- have be to north las vegas
and -PRON- be just a complete dump
woopee there be a light show on fremont street there
-PRON- live close to disneyland
what do -PRON- care
anyhow -PRON- be glad that the deuce be accommodate for -PRON- -PRON- have a wheelchair lift and tie down
if -PRON- be that slow -PRON- will help -PRON- out
-PRON- be in a wheelchair lol
what suck about -PRON- be that the bus be very slow
-PRON- can not beat the price though
-PRON- be $ 7\/day
the driver however can not make change so beware
if -PRON- be take just one trip -PRON- be good off save a buck by pay $ 3 each way
-PRON- think there be a bus run every 20 minute at some part in the day
-PRON- do not know the exact schedule
fyi outside the coca cola factory near the mgm grand there be a kiosk where -PRON- can purchase daily or 3-day pass
there may be other but this be the only one -PRON- notice
-PRON- think 3-day pass be $ 15
if -PRON- be claustrophobic this definitely be not a bus for -PRON-
-PRON- will get crowd at time
last year when -PRON- go to las vegas -PRON- be talk to one of the local -PRON- would meet on the deuce who work in the fashion show mall
-PRON- be cool and tell -PRON- about the place -PRON- need to check out in town
-PRON- also mention where to find hooker 24\/7
haha
thank but no thank
if -PRON- be intrigue find a 24-hour starbucks
let -PRON- just tell -PRON- right now if -PRON- be plan on go to any other hotel\/casino that be off the main strip take a taxicab
-PRON- make the mistake of take a bus from -PRON- forget where to the rio
never again
-PRON- could not believe the clientele on the bus
-PRON- think one dude be go to just go weird on -PRON- after god know what -PRON- shoot up in -PRON- vein
there be some other wack job on the bus as well
-PRON- could not wait to get off
-PRON- take a cab back to -PRON- hotel
man -PRON- be like a $ 13 ride back to the stratosphere
if -PRON- do not mind spend the cash do not mind look for parking hate the bus and
well all of the above just go rent a car
there be plenty of other offering available for vegas that be off the strip
maybe -PRON- because of -PRON- age
but -PRON- be not very impressed
-PRON- seem that this place be well kind of awkward
-PRON- have the nachos and -PRON- be decent nothing to really complain about
if -PRON- not seat at the bar or the bench -PRON- be stick with the table which have barely enough room for three ppl
this mean the three plate be pretty much touching each other and -PRON- good friend with the person sit next to -PRON-
hope
-PRON- do not have a space issue
-PRON- guess the place be for more of a couple setting
-PRON- have one beer and leave
maybe go again maybe
r\
-PRON- want to love -PRON- but can not quite yet
pro beer selection extensive tap and bottle list
-PRON- have have the opportunity to try some great beer here include bcbs and kbs
-PRON- can order flight of beer four 5 ounce pour if -PRON- want to try several beer
ingredient locally source food everything have always taste fresh
-PRON- enjoy the lunch half and half option with the garden salad and soup du jour
the vinaigrette dress be tasty
con
price a little hefty compare to other restaurant in town
a beer will typically cost $ 7 $ 8
a sandwich at lunch be around $ 11-$13
-PRON- would definitely recommend bar service if -PRON- have a small party
service be much faster
am samstag hatten wir
unseren ersten
und letzten besuch
-PRON- be bella italia in stuttgart
das ambiente ist eigentlich ganz angenehm und wir unterstützen gerne gute lokale
-PRON- be stadtteil
empfang war aber bereit
eher
kühl und unprofessionell so empfängt man keine gäste
essensauswahl ist gleich null man kann entweder ein menu essen oder einzelne gerichte darau 3 gerichte + 1 dessert
mag man keinen fisch\/muscheln und hat an dem abend keine lust auf fleisch hat man verloren
salat gibt keinen getränkeseitig gibt es ausser
wein und
wasser auch nix
doch
apfelsaft und orangensaft
wartezeiten waren recht hoch allerding war der laden voll
nimmt man da menu statt einzelne gerichte
wird man nicht satt da man fürs quasi
gleiche geld
-PRON- be menu mini portionen bekommt
geschmacklich sehr einfach und einfach nur mittelmaß
das gesamte konzept ist einfach ein witz
null auswahl sowohl essen und trinken),arrogante und unaufmerksam personal
eine köchin die angeblich a la mama kocht
meine mama kocht besser und interessanter ich auch und für das gebotene komplett unangemessene preise
das beste an dem laden war der klavierspieler allerding wäre auch hier ab und zu mal ne pause hilfreich gewesen
fazit
nie wieder für das geld bekomme ich in stuttgart und der welt raffiniertere und leckerer essen
das bella italia ist eine echte enttäuschung für leute die oft und gerne hochpreisig essen und die preise sind in diesem bereich
und dafür auch ein besondere erlebnis erwarten
nicht empfehlenswert total überbewertet
todd 's be in the running to replace the now close rosemary 's as the intimate private restaurant that be use by executive in the film and tv industry when -PRON- be in town for the national association of broadcasters conference each april
the reason be the combination of innovative cuisine serve in appropriate portion and with quite good service
for example one of -PRON- have sear scallop which be nearly impossible to prepare plate and serve simultaneously with other plate at the same table short rib with jalapeno mash
the scallop be divine as be the hor d'oeuvres and the short rib
mark 's service be very good
to step up to five star -PRON- wife and -PRON- would recommend the follow 1
step up the quality of the wine list considerably
-PRON- could only drink wine by the glass that night
even so -PRON- would have be wonderful to see some superb wine by the glass on offer something in the $ 20 per glass range
2
the caesar salad be very plain just tear lettuce a tiny bit of dressing almost none and two mandolin slice piece of cheese
the ingredient be fresh but this really really need help -PRON- be almost flavorless the presentation be awful and there be no anchovy on offer
what be caesar salad without anchovy
well -PRON- be a pizza hut salad that be what -PRON- be
3
due to the severe drought -PRON- realize that there must be an economy of service
if the drought ever end then -PRON- strongly recommend step up the service a pour the wine into fresh wine glass each time b use table cloth on each table c provide full service for the silverware d unfold napkin and offer to place in client lap and e use a crumb scraper to remove bit from the tablecloth at least twice during the meal
-PRON- have have lunch and dinner here a hand full of time
the sushi be always fresh and flavorful
the ambience could be good
the seating be a little tight and cramp but as be many sushi joint guess this may just come with the territory
-PRON- suggest the godzilla specialty roll
this be a really good breakfast joint
the egg be good bacon be great and fresh squeezed juice rock
try a mimosa and -PRON- be bitter
-PRON- tell the waitress and -PRON- take -PRON- off the bill
-PRON- be come back every day
so -PRON- know the food be good
as rib eye and salmon freak -PRON- have an awesome experience at trader vics
this be -PRON- first time
always drive by and want to go in
jerome and -PRON- go on a tuesday night around 6:30 and be greet and seat right away
lovely ambiance music decor everything
drank shirley temples and ginger ale
-PRON- do not serve with a gun
everything be from bottle the way -PRON- be in 1940 's
that be nice
have chop ice burg salad
all ingredient be fresh and the plate chill
bacon be not as crisp as -PRON- would have want
but the dressing coat each chunk of lettuce be fine
the blue cheese be soft and wonderful
would not get -PRON- again
-PRON- want to try the caesar
the bread be awesome
love the freshness and the onion and the vinegar\/ginger tray for dipping
the cracker be alright
interesting touch
the waiter explain the oven and how -PRON- hang the meat in the hot oven where -PRON- smoke the food and the flame never touch -PRON-
-PRON- have salmon
soooooooooooooo good
look like -PRON- may have be go to be dry but not
-PRON- be silky and so melt in -PRON- mouth good with the sauce -PRON- come on
the pureed potato have just the right touch of spice
so smooth
the asparagus be perfect
all on hot plate
jerome have rib eye
yum
-PRON- be wonder if -PRON- would compare to ruth 's
it do
such a generous cut
the crispy edge just the right salt and cook medium rare just the way -PRON- like
tender and get good and good with each bite
take home leftover and that bone to chew on later
plan to go back again and to tell friend about
sorry so many of reviewer have poor experience
-PRON- be not a chinese food place
lot of reviewer have chinese sound dish
want to try the duck
great service and $ 90 total for everything
pretty fair -PRON- think for two entree and for the side that come with the meat
fair portion
can not wait to go again
maestros be next on the list though
oh -PRON-
ambiente ganz ok man fühlt sich eigentlich recht wohl bedienung sehr freundlich
essen und das ist für mich der grund weshalb dies restaurant von mir bzw
un nur 2 sterne bekommt
es schmeckte überhaupt nicht
kein gewürz und teilweise eigenartiger nachgeschmack
dieses restaurant werden wir nicht nochmal besuchen
seriously
what kind of restaurant do not have child seat
-PRON- do not stay for the food because -PRON- do not have -PRON-
just look at the place make -PRON- think -PRON- would be a lovely place to have lunch with -PRON- other mommy friend
after read most of the other review -PRON- guess -PRON- should consider -PRON- lucky that -PRON- do not spend the money
salmon dry\/overcook
server be pleasant but service a bit sloooow
-PRON- use to take -PRON- kid here year ago but -PRON- do not think -PRON- will return
how do -PRON- like -PRON- apple
-PRON- can tell -PRON- that -PRON- certainly like -PRON- in elias famous apple cake
moist apple icious cake bake with a perfect crumble topping be a temptation that be hard for anyone to resist
and yes the rumour be true first timer 's be hand a very generous complimentary piece
mystic muffin be a breakfast lunch joint with personality
elias and wonita 's personality
the duo will make sure that any stranger who walk through -PRON- door be no longer a stranger when -PRON- walk out
as for the other menu item because -PRON- have be spoil with the availiability of fantastic middle eastern cuisine in ottawa -PRON- can not honestly say that the rest of the menu would keep -PRON- come back but for some delicious apple cake that be so good that -PRON- must be forbid
definitely
this be really not good
this franchise be usually very good all the time
the turn over lately have -PRON- kind of upset the people that show great customer service be no longer there
aside from the manager and other lady there and maybe one cook and morning people everyone be new and learn
but after hour saturday 's and weekend be downright scary
especially on christmas eve when -PRON- stop in to the drive -PRON- just for 2 drink and maybe some fries(were -PRON- thought
-PRON- answer after the pleasant recorded message be simply what -PRON- wife refer to as extremely rude and to quote -PRON- be close this be at 9:20pm
rode around a person sleep against the wall by the front door in the chair and the person who answer hide after what -PRON- just say
last time this happen the night crew go bye bye
as -PRON- next call the corporate number hopefully a restructure will happen on the weekend night
come in at 12:30 on a saturday and the place be pack
-PRON- be a 30 minute wait for a party of 2 but be well worth -PRON-
-PRON- order the benny duo with bella bella benny and the chile verde benny
both turn out fantastic the poach egg be perfect
-PRON- upgrade -PRON- hash brown to a pancake and go with the blueberry danish pancake
-PRON- be large and fluffy
-PRON- also have a good drink selection -PRON- get a brewmosa with -PRON- meal
since -PRON- purchase hsa back in 2010 -PRON- have have nothing but good thing to say about the company
-PRON- have even go as far as advise -PRON- family and friend to purchase this product if -PRON- do not already have a home warranty plan
-PRON- be not sure how many have purchase but -PRON- be sure -PRON- neighbor dr. said pay for the plan -PRON- be there when -PRON- do -PRON-
this place be fantastic a small simple but clean restaurant serve cambodian vietnamese food with appropriate background music to boot
to start with the hot french coffee with condense milk be exquisite starbuck 's look out
so good
-PRON- have 2 cup
-PRON- each have soup the khmer chicken seafood soup excellent and the spicy house special hue beef soup with round rice noodle and beef brisket also excellent
-PRON- follow with mikroolaa a noodle dish quite good and original khmer stir pan noodle with chicken excellent medium spicy be still rather spicy and perfect for -PRON-
-PRON- highly recommend this place and when -PRON- be back ion the area -PRON- plan to return
-PRON- be not a country fan by any stretch of the imagination however during the week this be a really fun bar
-PRON- would avoid the long line on the weekend fyi
-PRON- also hear the grub here be pretty darned good
-PRON- will preface that -PRON- will not eat at any buffet even on the strip and that -PRON- be visit this restaurant on a tuesday night at 10 p.m.
-PRON- be not sure how this restaurant would be in the middle of a dinner rush but -PRON- be very pleased with -PRON- meal and the environment
after visit a few other casino restaurant this one really hit the spot
seriously the good caesar salad -PRON- have be have
-PRON- also highly recommend the lobster bisque
-PRON- have visit the counter twice and will not again
-PRON- first visit
-PRON- drop $ 15 on a burger and fry plus a tip
the burger be ok but there be definitely good burger in downtown phoenix i.e. 1130 in the az center
on -PRON- second visit -PRON- take -PRON- daughter for a celebratory milkshake after -PRON- music audition
the shake be just ok and pricey
what be bad when -PRON- look at -PRON- bank statement the charge be different than -PRON- remember approve with a $ 6 tip on a $ 15 purchase
-PRON- like to think -PRON- be a generous tipper but this be certainly fraud
-PRON- call to resolve the issue and be ask to come in and talk to a manager
when -PRON- come in one slow afternoon total of 5 people be eat at the time -PRON- wait to speak with a manager for over 15 minute the whole time with a server let -PRON- know every few minute that the manager would be with -PRON- in a minute
-PRON- finally leave -PRON- business card with a note to call or email -PRON-
-PRON- be not surprised -PRON- have not hear back
-PRON- will not be go back to the counter anytime soon but not solely because of this bad experience
instead of eat overprice yet mediocre burger and shake at the counter walk across the street to 5 guy in cityscape or coney island on monroe to save a few buck for a good burger
-PRON- have a big table for two the service be great and the food be fantastic
-PRON- love -PRON- a lot
the soup have a lot content and the sauce be special and tasty -PRON- would love to compare -PRON- with gyu kaku this one be less expensive but have good taste
despite of the meat the appetizer be delicious too
-PRON- order the gangnam combo
-PRON- be only 65 fo人two people and -PRON- really worth the price
this place be really popular -PRON- recommend -PRON- come early
excellent
-PRON- go for amazing drink and fry chicken
-PRON- think what really make -PRON- be the amazing truffle gravy sauce that come with the biscuit and the the fry chicken
an other thing -PRON- highly recommend be the kale salad -PRON- be really really good
the wine selection be smart and the cocktail solid
look for a smalltalk free shopping experience
then proceed to assistant front end manager maria chavez 's checkout line
-PRON- will get -PRON- in and out without say so much as hello goodbye or thank -PRON-
the ambiance be nice
but the bartender be rude
-PRON- be hand -PRON- drink and never hear from -PRON- bartender herbie again
what be the point of look at something nice if the service be poor
pretty on the outside ugly on the inside
-PRON- learn something here at the nine find irishmen pub
if -PRON- order a black tan -PRON- be get a glass with guiness float atop bass ale
if on the other hand -PRON- order a half half -PRON- will be get guiness float atop harp lager
the half half be 100 irish
sláinte
-PRON- be great
what more could -PRON- possibly want for 20 buck
-PRON- be clean staff be friendly and there be lot of machine weight free parking and lot of it)if -PRON- be so serious about fitness that -PRON- feel this place deserve a bad review because -PRON- do not have all the equipment -PRON- need then go somewhere else
for the average person this be a pretty awesome deal
-PRON- just get back from this new place in -PRON- neighbourhood which -PRON- have hear so much about
first off -PRON- wait in line for about 40 minute which be entirely due to the fact that the kitchen be so slow that in the entire time -PRON- wait only a few meal come out
the food be barely mediocre
-PRON- son order the pyramid of pancake from the kid menu and get three extremely thin cold pancake
one be a normal size and the other two be the size of loonie
definitely a much small portion than be expect and -PRON- end up give -PRON- food from -PRON- plate to fill -PRON- up
-PRON- have the hungry diner
the egg be cook perfectly the potato be cold and bland the bean be cold the pancake be thin and cold and seem pre cook
-PRON- husband order the croque madame which -PRON- enjoy but again the potato be cold
other than -PRON- well cook egg and the server be very nice
-PRON- have nothing great to say about this place
those two thing be not worth the wait or the money and be definitely not enough to warrant a repeat visit
-PRON- can find a million other place that serve a mediocre breakfast without the wait
really great neighbourhood diner with unique offering
-PRON- favourite be the smoke fish and hash brown
-PRON- order the sausage only because -PRON- be homemade and -PRON- be very good
fresh bread bake in the premise
decent wine
good price
awesome tune
pretty good go to type of place
crowd in the weekend
stop here for lunch because the place -PRON- want to go to be pack
get the two slice lunch special
the staff be very cordial but the pizza be lack luster with a tasteless soggy crust
end up throw away the free yelp check in order of zeppoli too
-PRON- be tasteless and chewy obviously make from the same pizza dough the pizza be make with
too many great pizza place in this area to waste another trip here again
way better than in and out but at $ 6 a double burger -PRON- would expect as much
there be no drive through and be sure to get the small size fry possible $ 3.99 as -PRON- be enough for 4 people and get -PRON- cajun style
this place be just okay
not quite sure why -PRON- get such crazy hype
the flavour be good and authentic flavour
two taco be large enough for a meal
but -PRON- be not crazy cheap nor particularly innovative
the gobernator be dry and the octopus be too chewy sign of be overdone
-PRON- will come back once more to try the baja fish and the cactus
but -PRON- do not expect -PRON- mind to be blow
ok
not throw -PRON- money at -PRON-
-PRON- be glad -PRON- try this great restaurant out
the restaurant be locate in the aria city center in a mall call the crystal
-PRON- be locate on the second floor that look like a wooden aladdin lamp
the ambiance be great
-PRON- be comfortable cozy and have live music
the food be pretty awesome
-PRON- order the cowboy ribeye cut bone in steak
-PRON- be the second large steak on the menu
-PRON- be probably by far the good cut of steak -PRON- have have
-PRON- be tender soft and juicy
the potato au gratin be alright
next time -PRON- be go to try the lobster mash potato
the bread -PRON- serve be pretty impressive
-PRON- actually get a bread basket full of different assortment of bread
there be pretzel bread wheat white bread stick and other that -PRON- can not recall right now
taste like -PRON- be freshly bake that day
the service be the reason why -PRON- give this place 5 star instead of 4
-PRON- server be outstanding
-PRON- be pretty knowledgeable about the food
help -PRON- make up -PRON- mind on what -PRON- want right away
do not give -PRON- too much info where -PRON- would confuse -PRON-
-PRON- do not take much to confuse -PRON-
-PRON- check up on -PRON- every now and then to see how -PRON- be do on -PRON- meal
-PRON- ask if -PRON- want to order dessert
-PRON- decline because -PRON- be stuff like a turkey at a thanksgiving dinner
so -PRON- politely ask for the bill
so -PRON- server bring -PRON- back a raspberry sorbet with -PRON- bill
-PRON- be on the house and
and -PRON- say -PRON- could not let -PRON- go without have dessert to complete -PRON- wonderful meal
how cool be that
-PRON- be not a sorbet fan but -PRON- still take a few bite because -PRON- be a fatass
-PRON- recommend to go and enjoy the food but -PRON- will return because of the service
-PRON- be so disheartened to learn that this wonderful little gem be temporarily close after 40 year of -PRON- be in town
this place be the only german place in town that would not cost -PRON- an arm and a leg
-PRON- staff be nice and would recognize -PRON-
-PRON- have the good jagerschnitzel -PRON- have ever have and some of the good brat
-PRON- be truly a sad thing to see -PRON- go
seriously
the people give this terrible review be just expect way too much for what -PRON- pay for
-PRON- just stay 9 night 12\/10 12\/18 at ip
-PRON- pay just over $ 300 for a deluxe room just over $ 30 a night
-PRON- get a strip view could see monte carlo cosmopolitan bellagio ceasers harrah 's mirage ti from -PRON- 10th floor balcony very cool
-PRON- room be not much but -PRON- be very clean and housekeeping do a great job all week
-PRON- give -PRON- plenty of clean towel and washclothe
the shower drain a bit slow at time but for the most part be not a problem at all
-PRON- room be 2 door down from the elevator which work just fine and be not slow like a lot of people be complain about
the walking distance to both the strip and the monorail from -PRON- room be virtually non existent
the casino be small and do not have many slot machine that -PRON- wife be interested in but -PRON- be not plan on stay around the hotel that much anyway
-PRON- do the buffet only once and -PRON- be breakfast
-PRON- have a 2 for 1 and -PRON- be fine for what -PRON- pay $ 14.03 for 2 buffet
matsuri be awesome
-PRON- can not beat the central strip location for the price
perfect hotel for what -PRON- be look for
if -PRON- be look for luxury book a hotel with a luxury price do not be stupid
-PRON- be not go to find luxury here but -PRON- be not pay for luxury here either
would stay here again without hesitation
visit from out of town -PRON- break a tooth
dr. rabot 's office say -PRON- accept by dental insurance but when the consultation be over deny -PRON- insurance
beware
food
pizza la vecchia 2.5 star costata di vitello 5 star risotto aragosta 4 star
the pizza be actually a bit of a disappointment because the crust and the bottom be quite burn like black burn
let -PRON- just say -PRON- have have good pizza for less but then again this be probably not the joint to go to for pizza anyway
on to the good stuff
-PRON- boyfriend order the costata di vitello which be grill 12 oz veal chop marinate with herb and spice serve with mash potato and vegetable copy from -PRON- menu online
the veal chop be super tender and juicy
probably one of the good steak -PRON- have ever have
-PRON- would recommend this dish if -PRON- be feel carnivorous
-PRON- risotto aragosta lobster and shrimp in a light spicy tomato sauce be also very savoury
-PRON- have half a lobster bury with risotto
the mildly spicy tomato sauce give -PRON- a little flair which -PRON- appreciate
-PRON- can be quite a messy dish since -PRON- have to work -PRON- way to the meat in some part of the lobster but overall totally worth -PRON-
ambiance
3 star
-PRON- do come here on the mother 's day evening
so -PRON- understand that -PRON- be busy
but -PRON- be just too cramp in there and
a little too dim
-PRON- know -PRON- be part of set the mood
but -PRON- be dim enough that -PRON- honestly could not remember much about what the restaurant be like
and -PRON- make -PRON- quite sleepy
-PRON- even place a table right by a set of stair go downstairs and every time someone walk past -PRON- could feel -PRON- chair sink in
-PRON- be really annoying so -PRON- ask for another table
that table really should not be there since -PRON- be kind of in everyone 's way
sort of an unprofessional gesture on the restaurant 's part
but -PRON- move and the food be pretty amazing
service 4 star
-PRON- waiter be wonderful and well humour
-PRON- do forget that -PRON- want -PRON- pizza to be whole wheat but honestly not a big issue
-PRON- have pretty much everything -PRON- need and -PRON- be probably overwork from -PRON- be mother 's day
bad excuse for a resort
-PRON- advertise this as a more luxurious resort on expedia but i should have check yelp
the ac be make drip noise alll night
this be an extremely old hotel room be tony for two queen bed
-PRON- guess i would not be so disappointed if i be not set up for something way better
this could be a nice quant place
but the false advertising be a big turn off
this place be awful
come here on a friday night during the ncaa tourney look for a place for good music with friend
-PRON- pay the $ 5 cover but the band be terrible
the girl singing be not even able to carry a tune -PRON- think -PRON- be almost start bleed -PRON- be so bad
-PRON- use the lady room which be disgusting
the toilet paper dispenser be break and all 3 sink be clog and full of nasty brown water
the bad part
there be a bathroom attendant in there collect tip

the food be good hearty portion not sure if -PRON- from all the beer but i come by every time -PRON- be in la vegas

crazy huge menu that s very consistent
most of the menu cater towards vegetarian and middle eastern dish but there s definitely enough for a carnivore with sub worth two meal
fairly friendly staff though -PRON- do vary and once -PRON- sit down -PRON- speedy service generally but get a seat may take a while
-PRON- veeeery popular
oh and -PRON- basically have some of the good milkshake malt phosphate etc
etc

-PRON- be wrong
-PRON- server be so slow
-PRON- be become a joke with -PRON- on if -PRON- forget about -PRON- or not
the food be ok when -PRON- finally arrive but nothing amazing
-PRON- really need to hire a server who be not 70 year old
-PRON- be just sayin
over the last 8 year -PRON- have three place that be at least 4 star or good
-PRON- could say taste be everything but -PRON- would be lie customer service be 1 follow by taste price etc etc
so on and so on

-PRON- be happy to say this place exceed all of -PRON- expectation
the customer service be above par
-PRON- be greet and seat by a hostess with a smile -PRON- busboy be attentive and friendly also with a smile that just put -PRON- over the top
the sushi chef be all of those thing and more -PRON- pair a couple of bottle of sake with -PRON- meal and return several time to pour -PRON- another as need
-PRON- may say this be typical or average service and while -PRON- agree -PRON- be not unheard of -PRON- have be -PRON- experience that typical be average to mediocre and bad
for a strip mall sushi joint at 5:30 on a tuesday -PRON- feel like a vip thank god the food be exceptional

five star for outstanding happy hour and service
happy hour hh be offer from 5p-7p 7 day a week in the bar area
-PRON- use to frequent the summerlin fleming 's hh but -PRON- be near impossible to obtain a seat due to the limited bar area seating
-PRON- be happy to report that the town square location have 4 5x the bar seating

-PRON- can not wait to return for dinner so -PRON- can order -PRON- favorite med rare ribeye
-PRON- boyfriend and -PRON- stay at a terrible hotel just 2 block from arcadia farms and find -PRON- quite by accident on -PRON- second day
-PRON- love -PRON- so much -PRON- eat breakfast and lunch there every day for the remain 4 day of -PRON- trip
excellent food great music shabby chic ambiance
if -PRON- can sit at a table at which debbie be serve -PRON- will be so happy and get great service too
-PRON- be terrific
and -PRON- really recommend that -PRON- reserve a table if -PRON- be come for lunch
this place be so fabulous that -PRON- be crowd
-PRON- personal favorite the chocolate toffee muffin at breakfast and\/or the leek mushroom tart and for lunch the ham sandwich which be exceptionally good
or the strawberry chicken salad or the coconut cake which be worth every calorie or the iced tea or the lunch crepe with wild leek and chicken
pretty much -PRON- try everything on the menu and everything be completely exceptional
and the back patio be so peaceful and relaxing
nice place friendly lady
small and cozy
no high chair bring -PRON- own
just be not super impressed
-PRON- taste like the one -PRON- buy at costco
be hop for good
glad
-PRON- be already on that side of town
these folk be liar and cheat
i contract to have a fix make to -PRON- computer
technician jeremy make the fix and next day there still be a problem
send -PRON- an e mail twice -PRON- never answer
call the co. and speak to the boss
-PRON- say jeremy will call -PRON-
jeremy call and make a date to call -PRON- that night and fix the problem remotely
-PRON- never call
speak to the boss again
boss say jeremy tell -PRON- -PRON- speak to -PRON- and fix the problem
that be a lie
man never call -PRON-
boss say -PRON- will give -PRON- the money back
i say all i want be the problem fix
boss hang up on -PRON-
do not do business with these people
-PRON- be liar and cheat
come here for lunch with some friend and -PRON- be not all that busy
sat down get -PRON- drink and take a look at the menu
everything in the menu sound delicious
-PRON- friend both get the chicken parmesan and -PRON- get a chicken alfredo which be not on the menu
but -PRON- be happy to make -PRON-
after a long wait about 45 min -PRON- food finally come out -PRON- repeat the place be not very busy maybe about 3 other table be occupy
other than that -PRON- do have to say the food be worth the wait pasta have great flavor and perfectly cook chicken
-PRON- be kind of odd to -PRON- that the linguini -PRON- use for -PRON- dish be thin almost like spaghetti thin but still good in every way
-PRON- would definitely eat there again
food be kind of bland be really disappointed in the kim chi and bacon rice
do not taste the bacon or the kim chi
the rice cake be too soft
bulgogi be good but not much meat
-PRON- also order the blue lemonade and -PRON- be the sweet thing ever
-PRON- tell thr waiter and -PRON- say -PRON- could not change that because the sugar -PRON- use be what make -PRON- blue
service be fantastic though super nice waiter
-PRON- notice some review comment on pushy service
while there be quite a bit of salesperson on the sale floor if there be not enough people someone would complain about that
since the store be just that and not a museum -PRON- be ok with bring provide with service
-PRON- have be help by a friendly woman name lauren and -PRON- be very helpful both time -PRON- have be in
caveat
-PRON- wish the item be about 30 less expensive
-PRON- be pricey
-PRON- be not go to lie
with that say a jacket that -PRON- buy be $ 20 more expensive in the store than -PRON- be online
-PRON- husband rave about the service department
-PRON- wish that instead of the convenience store next door there be the harley cafe that close in fremont street
have -PRON- next door to the harley store would have keep -PRON- in business
cheer
hear the crazy line up so when -PRON- come back to toronto want to check this out
-PRON- grow up on the fake chinese version of this and have this once in japan where -PRON- also fall out of -PRON- chair on how good -PRON- be
be curious how this fall on the spectrum
-PRON- would say if fake chinese be a 4 and the one in japan be a 10 this be a solid 7.5
do not get -PRON- wrong -PRON- be pretty good
maybe -PRON- be biased cuz -PRON- do not eat -PRON- in japan
-PRON- feel that the one in japan be even more creamy and fluffy though -PRON- could just be -PRON- memory
great cheesecake nonetheless
-PRON- have try both matcha no red bean and original
tbh -PRON- think -PRON- be both really good and no idea why no one line up for the matcha
-PRON- be a bit small but the matcha taste be awesome
-PRON- fiance love get the matcha ice cream too
that be a real winner
gertrude 's be a lovely restaurant at the entrance of the desert botanical gardens
-PRON- do not need a dbg ticket to visit gertrude 's
there be inside and outside seating and a great bar area
the outside seating be nestle among various beautiful desert flora and cacti a beautiful place to enjoy a bite when the weather be nice
gertrude 's have a nice brunch menu and light lunch item
the gertrude burger be tasty with a fabulous grill taste and the hummus be delicious
-PRON- like -PRON- berry lemonade
-PRON- have a few great cocktail like drink with no alcohol
-PRON- have be here with a couple friend and with a group of colleague from work
-PRON- can accommodate small group pretty well
enjoy gertrude 's before or after a walk in the fabulous dbg
-PRON- be spend another few day on the ground for the holiday and -PRON- be wait for -PRON- daughter to arrive so -PRON- make -PRON- way to the overlook to watch the plane for a bit
even at night -PRON- be a nice place to chill
sure -PRON- can not really see the entire airport but if the plane be take off from 18c.
-PRON- be a great spot for the kid too
plenty of parking and -PRON- be nice and dark which make -PRON- easy to see the plane
of course darkness mean that -PRON- need to pay just a bit of attention to -PRON- surrounding
so do that
-PRON- have a good experience here
-PRON- get a table right away
-PRON- have live music
service be excellent
-PRON- server be attentive and sweet
-PRON- come for the new belgium day
everyone at -PRON- party really enjoy -PRON- beer and -PRON- be great that part of the proceed go to charity
the decor be really nice
more seating than when -PRON- use to be a wine bar
bathroom be clean too
-PRON- do not get to try any food but a table next to -PRON- have a dip
and -PRON- look really good
central wine bar be cute and invite inside
there be a small area of wine by the bottle to purchase and a corking fee to enjoy one of those in the bar
there be a small menu of wine by the glass maybe 6 to 8 of each red and white a couple of beer and a cheese\/meat\/fruit plate
wine range from $ 7 to $ 11 per glass
a few of each the red and white be on tap and could be taste before order
the cheese plate be $ 15
-PRON- try two red both on tap a syrah and a pinot noir
one be $ 8 and the other $ 9
both be fine
-PRON- provide free bar snack which include popcorn and almond
overall -PRON- like the atmosphere and the wine be fine
however without any happy hour special on price per glass -PRON- be not sure -PRON- would go back at that time of day when other nearby place be offer equally good if not good wine with a great selection at good price $ 5 glass before 5 at postino about 2 mile up central
there be specials- wine tasting
-PRON- be just not sure central wine bar can compete without a happy hour special to bring people through the door
-PRON- expect to like the food but everything serve be less than mediocre
-PRON- have the classic lasagna a house favorite
-PRON- can not imagine how a dish like this could have be serve in a restaurant
unappeal little flavor no finesse and more like what -PRON- would expect from a frozen tv dinner
if -PRON- be make by a chef that person may need to find a new line of work- or find a good place to work as -PRON- be probably the chain restaurant 's standard that be low
-PRON- probably limit the food purchase to that which be the low quality food grade
caesar salad be acceptable but nothing -PRON- would order again
-PRON- wife 's dish chicken parm be not great but acceptable
dessert be commercial and average
service be very pleasant and efficient
food price be not high but that do not create a value for me- would rather have well prepare high quality food with portion much small
but no left over food to go for me-
-PRON- do not want to try that lasagne ever again
this restaurant probably do a good bar business and food for those demand little
pizzas do look ok but -PRON- do not try
-PRON- favorite location of the chain here in vegas
a couple other be kinda sketch small and usually way too crowded even though that be a good sign
regardless -PRON- have never have bad taco at any of -PRON- and super happy -PRON- open up a spot on the north side
lot of table too
pastor with everything be always a hit but -PRON- favorite be the suadero lengua and cabeza with everything
not a big fan of the tripe
so -PRON- always skip that but -PRON- must try the suadero
the lengua be always tender and delicious
do not forget the pepper and onion
lucky 's be great if -PRON- be look for this style of pizza
authentic great topping broccoli -PRON- favorite and the atmosphere be awesome
the family here be so warm all of -PRON- really funny always make -PRON- laugh when -PRON- go in there
thank -PRON- for be the first great food experience -PRON- have upon move to surprise
-PRON- have not be here in about 7 year
-PRON- end up come for dinner because -PRON- parent friend be regular here
have
some kind of free range chicken with ginger and green onion sauce veggie on the dish be tasty
-PRON- hear -PRON- be mustard green and -PRON- be suppose to be bitter
if that be the case then -PRON- taste the way -PRON- should
the chicken be tasty but could have be more tender
however -PRON- be not dry
the ginger and green onion sauce be plentiful and very tasty
some kind of duck with plum sauce this be not roast duck with a side of plum sauce
this be duck atop taro slice and veggie with a plum flavor sauce all over -PRON-
-PRON- be a sweet and sour flavor that most people who have -PRON- really enjoy
-PRON- be not -PRON- cup of tea but -PRON- be not bad
braised duck foot with dry shiitake mushroom with three old people at the table this be a hit
-PRON- have one
the duck foot be super tender
the sauce be tasty
the mushroom be soft as well
however -PRON- be more a chicken foot in the form of dim sum phoenix talon person than -PRON- be a duck foot person
tofu with salt fish and diced chicken in sizzle pot
-PRON- be usually not a fan of cub up soft tofu in any style but this be -PRON- favorite dish of the night
the tofu be soft and have a fresh tofu taste
there be just enough salt fish to flavor the entire dish while not be overly salty
-PRON- really like how the salt fish still have some texture and -PRON- be not just little speck here and there
the chicken be sort of an additive for -PRON-
-PRON- do not need to be there
love food in sizzle pot
-PRON- keep the food pip hot which be exactly how -PRON- should be eat
big spoon of this with a little rice make -PRON- a happy camper for the night
dessert be mung bean sweet soup not bad but -PRON- be not a fan of most bean sweet soup
this one be interesting though
thought there be a hint of cinnamon or nutmeg or something of that sort
total per person after tax and tip come to about $ 10 after 10 discount and tip
-PRON- also have leftover
not bad for that much food
cool story for the night
-PRON- family have not come in many year
one of the waitress claim -PRON- remember -PRON- grandfather
-PRON- think -PRON- be bluff
-PRON- turn out -PRON- remember -PRON- not from -PRON- frequent maple yip many year ago but because -PRON- use to work at fisherman villa and -PRON- grandfather be a regular there for many year
-PRON- only find out because -PRON- remember that -PRON- order roasted pigeon a lot there
-PRON- do have that on the menu here so maybe -PRON- will get that the next time -PRON- come
this be one of -PRON- new favorite sushi place in town
all of the roll -PRON- have have be delicious and the staff be always very friendly
-PRON- be not the cheap ayce but -PRON- be still very reasonable and worth the money
-PRON- also have a great deal when -PRON- be there that for $ 4 extra on the ayce -PRON- include all -PRON- can drink draft beer which work out great to wash down all the tasty\/spicy roll

check out be usually kinda slow but the cashier do honor mobile coupon which -PRON- can find right off -PRON- website
-PRON- normally have 40 off an item
be sure to read the fine print though
a lot of name brand item be exclude

this place will have -PRON- business for life
there be still honest people leave in this world
the repair guys do a re coat on -PRON- flat patio roof and justin and steve do a great job
-PRON- use a proprietary coating which be superior and will last longer than the material recommend by several other roofing company
both of the guy be very professional friendly and polite
-PRON- also inspect -PRON- tile roof and do several minor repair
the re coat job be do on time and the cost be very competitive
highly recommend

the rack look great and -PRON- be load the bin on -PRON- now
-PRON- garage be look great
thank charlie
college student work here and -PRON- make one wonder who be promote the high rating
be there the other night and be highly disappointed with the pizza and the service
the large pizza have maybe three small piece of sausage and way too many grill onion
there be a 40 min
wait
so -PRON- tell -PRON- to wait at -PRON- bar next door
-PRON- be happy hour and the menu say white wine for $ 5 so -PRON- order the house chardonnay
when -PRON- get -PRON- bill -PRON- be $ 28 for two chardonnay 's
when -PRON- inquire about the price -PRON- be tell that the chardonnay be not on happy hour and even though the menu list chardonnay 's from $ 8 to $ 14 -PRON- only stock one wine which cost $ 14\/glass
what trickery to make money
-PRON- should have tell -PRON- that the wine list on -PRON- menu be not stock
fraudulent practice
if -PRON- be possible to give zero star that be what -PRON- would give this awful company
if -PRON- review -PRON- yelp -PRON- rarely complain about a company-
but this one be a total scam artist
-PRON- home warranty send -PRON- claim to -PRON- to repair -PRON- double oven as the bottom oven be not work and the top one be
the technician arrive fumble with -PRON- oven then say oh shit -PRON- f'ed up and now -PRON- have no work oven at all
when -PRON- ask for invoice state this -PRON- give -PRON- a blank one and say not to worry another technician would be out to fix -PRON- all
now -PRON- home warranty be deny the claim state that the power supply be ruin be not wear and tear
mortify -PRON- have be call the company ask to speak with a supervisor for over two week with no call return
run from this dishonest company at all cost
buy a new oven be not the end of the world- however the deceit and the fact that -PRON- actually make -PRON- situation bad be horrible
there be plenty of other reputable repair company in town-
-PRON- highly recommend for the sake of -PRON- home or business that -PRON- use someone else
please see -PRON- other page that have very similar review under the name all desert repairs
-PRON- can see why -PRON- change -PRON- name with all of those horrible review
let -PRON- preface this by say that -PRON- purchase a bridesmaid 's dress here not a wedding gown
although -PRON- do go with the bride for -PRON- to try on wedding gown here
staff be friendly and on time
-PRON- have to remove -PRON- shoe right when -PRON- get in and -PRON- also can not bring in any drink coffee etc to the fitting room
there be a small couch for about two or three guest to sit
two fitting room just area with a curtain
-PRON- like that the fitting room have mirror in -PRON- but the curtain do not close all the way so pretty much everyone can see -PRON- get naked
dresses do not take long to come in
-PRON- require 50 deposit and then -PRON- pay the rest when the dress arrive
one of the dress have some damage but -PRON- do not put up a fuss when -PRON- point -PRON- out and be fix -PRON-
if -PRON- order 5 or more dress -PRON- get 10 off
if -PRON- be possible -PRON- would give -PRON- 10 star
so there be probably a gazillion people out there who market -PRON- service as photographer especially in vegas and honestly a lot of -PRON- photo be flat and boring and seem like -PRON- could have be take by any random person
but then there be meg who be an artistic photographer who have the ability to evoke emotion from a still image
-PRON- creativity be inspire -PRON- capture the intimate moment of life with the right placement and angle for -PRON- photo
-PRON- really can not say enough amazing thing about -PRON-
-PRON- be extremely professional and coach -PRON- through the photo and pose make -PRON- feel like a super model
-PRON- put -PRON- at ease during the photo and allow -PRON- to add -PRON- own element and -PRON- really feel like -PRON- care about -PRON- life and generally want to get to know -PRON- as a couple and individual before and during the photo
-PRON- be generally not a smiley person do not get -PRON- wrong
-PRON- be very happy -PRON- face just do not always show -PRON-
but -PRON- be able to find a way to coax -PRON- out of -PRON- for -PRON- engagement photo
-PRON- do lifestyle photography for wedding engagement anniversary senior portrait family photo and more
one day -PRON- will be charge a hefty price for -PRON- talent and will be ridiculously famous but since -PRON- just start -PRON- own business
-PRON- would definitely take advantage of -PRON- amazing pricing now
all yelper should bookmark -PRON- for a photo session
-PRON- reserve this term for food generally but meg really be the bomb diggity
@batchtoronto yelpto bringbatchhome brunch batchbrews
come here for a date night and be not disappoint
although -PRON- be base the review just off of a round of drink the decor in this place be fabulous and the sunday brunch menu look appetizing
-PRON- would really like to try
service be a bit of an issue -PRON- feel
-PRON- be almost like -PRON- server could not handle that -PRON- be not there for food
-PRON- get ask if -PRON- want food every 20 30 minute till -PRON- absolutely feel embarrassed to stay longer
not cool
-PRON- love the idea of the duce and have a blast hang out with friend here but the service be very lacking
-PRON- have a group of 15 + people by the end of the night
a handful of -PRON- be here from 7pm- midnight
-PRON- enjoy many handmade cocktail that be freshly muddle and serve in quart size mason jar at the tune of $ 15 21
but a quart do last quite a while but be water down by the end
one friend be try to get the bartender attention for a while before move onto another bar to try to get a drink
a couple time -PRON- disappear from -PRON- station the small bar near the food counter
-PRON- joke that -PRON- should just hop in there and make -PRON- own but -PRON- finally come back
-PRON- be in the party with another reviewer who mention -PRON- food take an hour and a half to get ready and after that hour and a half -PRON- still have not hear -PRON- name be call
-PRON- go to the pick up window and ask if -PRON- be ready and -PRON- be there
freeze cold
the cook say oh yea that be be sit there a while
no offer to re make warm -PRON- up or anything
and -PRON- group be hang out right near the food counter
how do -PRON- miss -PRON- and why do not -PRON- get -PRON- attention when the food be ready
-PRON- be sure -PRON- do not hear the name be call because -PRON- be later in the night and the dj have start blast music for the dance floor
a good system be in order for serve food when -PRON- have to rely on a loudspeaker that be drown out by the dance music
the valet situation be horrible at the end of the night
-PRON- have be to many other downtown spot that have valet and crowd but never a line that take 20 minute
-PRON- finally ask for -PRON- key and be direct to where the car be park so -PRON- could walk and get -PRON- -PRON-
-PRON- will probably be back but hope the duce can improve -PRON- service pay more attention to pay customer and figure out the valet situation
-PRON- be not the good area
so -PRON- do not want to walk a block or two on this dark sketchy block
wunderbares hotel in unmittelbarer nähe zum stage theater idealer ort zum übernachten für alle musical fans
-PRON- go to the regal cinema at village square quite often and have always want to try archi 's but never really get to go
but finally after see a film yesterday -PRON- friend and -PRON- decide to check out this thai cafe

-PRON- can choose the level of how spicy -PRON- want -PRON- food from 1 10 10 be the spicy
great food
-PRON- be affordable will definitely be back
-PRON- would give this place one star for the experience -PRON- just have but -PRON- do not get to take a class so -PRON- do not want to skew the rating too much
be forewarn -PRON- have a hard and fast policy that if -PRON- be more than five minute late -PRON- be not allow in
ok -PRON- get that -PRON- make sense in theory
-PRON- issue be that nowhere on the site be this post and -PRON- have never encounter this before
-PRON- be visit from out of town so -PRON- spend lot of time research class choose one at the studio get a babysitter walk a mile to get there and be six minute late
turn away
-PRON- know -PRON- should not have be late but -PRON- either need to be more understanding or post that info prominently on -PRON- website
this be a really upsetting experience not least because -PRON- try so hard
-PRON- be sleep deprive -PRON- body be drain and that class would have be helpful in -PRON- life right now
this place be great
-PRON- have be several time and -PRON- be always a good experience
-PRON- really enjoy the fact that -PRON- can pick -PRON- own seat for movie
-PRON- go here for after work drink on -PRON- weekly thursday networking event
the decor be modern with spacious seating
during the event -PRON- set up table with free appetizer such as pizza calamari cheese and bruschetta
-PRON- can not comment on the dinner or late night music scene but the two time -PRON- have go
the staff have be very nice
zu viert landeten wir eine sonntags aus verlegenheit hier
unser eigentlich ziel hatte geschlossen alle anderen restaurants in der gegend waren voll
wir waren etwa mißtrauisch und zweifelten ob es überhaupt einen gastraum gäbe da alle nach außerhausverkauf aussah
wir gingen mutig hinein und ließen un überraschen
unser fazit das griechische gasthaus falken
ist sicherlich kein sternerestaurant aber die leistung war absolut in ordnung und das bei einem hervorragenden preis leistungsverhältnis
ich hatte gyros mit kartoffelscheiben dazu gab es einen krautsalat
die kartoffelscheiben waren zwar ein wenig fett aber insgesamt war es lecker und die portion absolut ausreichend
meine begleiter hatten sich für salate entschieden die ebenfall
sehr groß waren und lecker aussahen
für ein schnell
mittag- oder abendessen ist das gasthaus falken daher eine absolute empfehlung
-PRON- get -PRON- lip do here and -PRON- absolutely love -PRON-
the doctor be not out for -PRON- money -PRON- actually tell -PRON- -PRON- have beautiful lip and that -PRON- do not need -PRON-
tell -PRON- all the side affect and all the positive
do not give -PRON- big balloon lip
do a little at a time
so -PRON- be not overwhelmed and come back and finish -PRON- off
-PRON- go for a very natural look love the doctor
-PRON- like the mgm for -PRON- location mainly
live on the east side of town a straight drive down trop
and -PRON- be at the parking garage
-PRON- park here when go to the immediate area outside of the mgm
-i do not gamble much on the strip
but -PRON- still love to plat the old horse racing derby machine
-PRON- have move a short distance from where -PRON- be but -PRON- can still here the horse trot around the track while walk through
the layout of the casino be decent as well
the walkway be large to help navigate the large crowd that gather
with many place to eat -PRON- have only be to a select few here
but -PRON- will try some more in the future
-my big let down be the lion habitat that use to be there be now go
look like another restaurant have take over that place
-PRON- make sense for -PRON- to put something there to make money but -PRON- be nice to see the lion from time to time
-PRON- have read all the bad about this canters but decide to try -PRON- anyways
to -PRON- surprise there be a woman outside spew -PRON- venom and attempt to direct patron elsewhere
-PRON- message to -PRON- be
get a life
seriously try to damage a business be beyond reasonable
if -PRON- do not like the service food quality or atmosphere go somewhere else
compare this restaurant to new york be ridiculous
ny be closed
maybe because -PRON- could not continue there overly large and under price sandwich and continue to be profitable
maybe because -PRON- be tired of the annoying patron like the woman at the door here in vegas
this place be not perfect by any mean
-PRON- be obviously struggle to get go
give -PRON- a break
do everyone really want another empty space in tivoli
when -PRON- picky eat son say french toast be good than -PRON- and ask -PRON- to check in and give 5 star -PRON- must
-PRON- wife and -PRON- be in agreement this place be ok but -PRON- be not go back
the food be just ok the atmosphere be damage by music that be painfully loud the service be not very warm and welcome and on top of that the price be high
lunch for -PRON- wife
and -PRON- be $ 80
this include a number of taco 's that still leave -PRON- a bit hungry at the end -PRON- wife have 3 glass of wine -PRON- have some lemonaide
-PRON- think $ 80 can buy good food and a good experience elsewhere
-PRON- really do not think the slider be that good here
-PRON- seem all hype and -PRON- so busy since -PRON- be usually on the east coast and this be the close location to -PRON- -PRON- be from ca
-PRON- do not know if -PRON- be worth come here and look for this if -PRON- be on the strip like -PRON- do
the slider and chicken ring taste microwaveable and the french fry taste old and be not crunchy
-PRON- friend also say -PRON- taste just like the one -PRON- can get at the store
the slider be so small too and -PRON- only have a thin piece of meat cheese onion and a pickle not what -PRON- be expect
2 4 cheese slider a small fry and a soft drink be not worth $ 9.27
good thing -PRON- split -PRON- with a friend and -PRON- get more food after
-PRON- be sorry
white castle
-PRON- be not sure if -PRON- will be back
-PRON- have recently change the name to -PRON- but -PRON- be the same restaurant
the place be cozy with around 10 table
-PRON- come as a group of 3 and each order a rice dish
from personal observation -PRON- be probably the only table that do not order the infamous pork bone soup
-PRON- chicken bibimbap be rather tasteless
would not recommend
-PRON- also order the sizzle chicken plate squid rice pot
the chicken plate be incredibly greasy with only a few piece of chicken
only the squid rice pot taste decent
100 would recommend
stacey have do -PRON- makeup so many time
and -PRON- be always be stunning and
exactly what -PRON- want
-PRON- be the only person -PRON- trust to do -PRON- wedding makeup
not only be -PRON- so talented with makeup artistry -PRON- be incredibly patient and an amazing listener
wish -PRON- could give 10 star
decide to try this place tonight with -PRON- girl and -PRON- good friend and son
margarita pitcher to start with and usual chip and salsa
wish the margarita be a little strong but -PRON- be good
-PRON- order the chicken enchilada with green chile sauce
-PRON- be yummy but not outstanding
-PRON- girl and -PRON- friend order some big dish and -PRON- like -PRON-
-PRON- good friend say the tamale be yucky tho
-PRON- son order the quesadilla with fry and -PRON- do not touch the quesadilla
-PRON- mom try -PRON- and know why -PRON- be nasty
so -PRON- tell the server
and -PRON- refund -PRON-
overall very nice but -PRON- wanna try -PRON- mex appetite somewhere else next time
extremely unfriendly bar staff
-PRON- have be twice in the last 2 week and have the same bad experience both time
stood at the bar and -PRON- ignore -PRON- and when -PRON- finally ask -PRON- say to move to the end of the bar even though -PRON- would be serve earlier in the day at the side of the bar
next time -PRON- come there be long line at both end of the bar and people sit at the table game with empty glass wait for service and one poor woman work while two other stand watch -PRON- from the floor
when -PRON- go over to ask if there be another bar or more help would be come
-PRON- say -PRON- just have to wait
this be unlike anything -PRON- have ever see in any casino
two visit and both time slow surly and extremely poor attitude toward the customer
landscaping and view be pretty but -PRON- will not be back
and -PRON- have plan on a mini vacation at the new hotel
can -PRON- give zero star
-PRON- have look forward to an evening at chow and end up extremely disappointed
most of the appetizer be bland the drink be overprice at $ 45 for one glass of champagne
when -PRON- be seat -PRON- see a hair on -PRON- tablecloth along with a large crumb
there be a $ 16 overcharge on -PRON- bill
-PRON- spend $ 500 for 4 people
-PRON- would recommend take -PRON- money to tao at the venetian instead
within walking distance for much of residential asu and most importantly open 24 hour a day seven day a week
many breakfast spot near campus close at 2:00 in the afternoon or require a car to reach
the pitcher of coffee on the table be perfect for late night study or recover
long narrow space
everything be still new
hd television
table can be move around to accommodate large group and lot of booth be available to seat two or four
still an ihop not snooze but a nice addition to the area
the former ihop near campus be a casualty of the graduate hotel not a bad trade off but -PRON- be happy ihop be back
service this day be very very very slow a huge negative
server be friendly and the food be solid when -PRON- do arrive except for the pancake
-PRON- be beyond cold odd for a restaurant that have or once have the word pancake in -PRON- name
-PRON- sense early on that there be a service issue this day
-PRON- watch an apologetic manager check on table
-PRON- will definitely be back however to give -PRON- another try
the facility and the location be just too good
absolutely the good customer service -PRON- have ever have
every time i walk -PRON- be greet with smile and happiness
drink be always amazing and make super fast
-PRON- would highly recommend this starbuck to anyone
excellent customer service
service employee be top notch and do the job correctly the first time
kala be the service manager and do an outstanding job
very customer orient
perfecly al dente
with impasto be own by two of montreal 's many best know chefs(stefano faita and michele forgione
-PRON- explain why -PRON- lunch be do to perfection
these two guy along with -PRON- wonderful staff -PRON- certainly know what -PRON- be do and -PRON- show
step into the restaurant do look around
-PRON- be a beautiful lovely and modern ambiance
especially during night time
with great little touch throughout the restaurant
comfortable chair and spacious simple marble table
just beautiful
when go for dinner and sit at the bar there be these lovely touch such as -PRON- own little copper light and with a wide open view of -PRON- open kitchen
great concept
very kind chef who take -PRON- time to speak with -PRON- from time to time
when sit down this be where -PRON- eye and mouth begin to work
right away -PRON- be greet by a lovely kind and well speak waitress
-PRON- menu be present to -PRON- as -PRON- explain a bit as to how -PRON- work
due to the fact -PRON- be -PRON- first visit there
certainly not -PRON- last
after a few minute a lovely dish of -PRON- homemade bread stick and focaccia be serve to -PRON- table
follow by -PRON- drink
for those that enjoy butter and bread
there be no need for the butter the bread speak for -PRON- be self
believe -PRON-
when look at -PRON- menu which change from time to time -PRON- be very pleased that for once a restaurant that do not have a strong focus on slather large amount of tomato bath dish or typical american dish
-PRON- menu have nothing but a strong authentic italian emphasis on -PRON-
thank -PRON- for that
however this be where -PRON- will be upfront about -PRON- one and only negative criticism
for the entree there be only two choice
both equally very delicious
yet only two choice
as for -PRON- main course again only three choice
follow by dessert only two choice
-PRON- do not need an encyclopedia size menu of choice yet -PRON- do find that -PRON- lack variety
mainly because -PRON- know these guy and -PRON- staff can do magic in the kitchen
and -PRON- would have like to see more choice of -PRON- wonderful meal
-PRON- menu have a bit of a concept
an entree + main course(two service $ 21 per person
or a main course with the addition of appetizer follow by the dessert(three service $ 27 per person
as always drink be not include
so -PRON- begin with the appetizer
a warm octopus salad serve with tender fresh leaf of radicchio and a delicious vinaigrette
absolute perfection in every bite
the octopus which be quite easy to overcook and change -PRON- be texture from tender to rubbery -PRON- be perfectly tender only very few delicate movement of the knife be necessary
follow by two dish of fusili cacio e pepe(fusili in a very light cream sauce that stick perfectly to the pasta without have a puddle of sauce at the bottom of -PRON- dish
with freshly grated and very tasty aged parmesan cheese finish by a potent taste of freshly grated black pepper
as for the pasta -PRON- be self
simply and perfectly al dente
how -PRON- should be
-PRON- meal be finish by a delicate and delicious panna cotta
which be none other than heavy cream infuse with vanilla bean sugar gelatin
-PRON- have the texture of a firm but silky smooth delicate custard
with a fresh and tangy compote of strawberry
fantastic
more often than not -PRON- look for restaurant that have a strong focus on quality over quantity
as -PRON- portion may not be big much less massive(which -PRON- love that in a restaurant
impasto hit the spot beautifully
-PRON- can truly taste the hard work passion and love -PRON- have for food
especially since everything be freshly make by -PRON-
from -PRON- bread to the bread stick and pasta
true hard talented work pay off
-PRON- taste bud and -PRON- appreciate -PRON- very much so
-PRON- look forward in return
this clinic be inadequately staffed
-PRON- call frequently and be always place on hold for inappropriate amount of time
in the past -PRON- be provide with incorrect information about -PRON- pet
more specifically -PRON- be tell -PRON- dog be fine when -PRON- end up be in heart failure
of course this require stressful emergency visit for -PRON-
-PRON- always wait excessive amount of time for appointment
when -PRON- say -PRON- take -PRON- three hour total for an appointment here with -PRON- dog -PRON- be not exaggerate
most recently -PRON- be literally five minute late -PRON- dog 's appointment
and -PRON- be tell the vet could not see -PRON- dog
the only reason -PRON- have not switch to a new vet be because -PRON- dog be in heart failure and be not expect to live much longer
-PRON- already switch -PRON- other dog to a different vet
-PRON- give two star because -PRON- always like the vet -PRON-
-PRON- be the administrative aspect that be an issue
the falafel be ok
nothing special
however -PRON- pretty darn cheap
there be few place to sit
the place dosnt have much seating
-PRON- also a store witj lot of thing for sale
one of the new addition and member of italian restaurant on leith walk
-PRON- be a restaurant cum cafe cum takeaway and be strategically locate on the corner of baxter street and leith walk just a few metre down the playhouse which make -PRON- an easy target for pre or post theatre meal option for theatre goier
the owner tony crolla have follow -PRON- style from la favorita and vittorias
the food be delicious and the free wi fi be an good extra to an afternoon coffee and cake or a quick snack
the glass house of taste of italy give a sense of openness and warmth
-PRON- forget to bring -PRON- lunch at work so i decide to order food but do not want anything unhealthy
-PRON- be so happy to find this sub place on grub hub and -PRON- deliver
-PRON- have to say -PRON- sandwich be amazing
-PRON- get the club sub meal and add jalapeno and instead of mayo do the chipotle
so good
-PRON- will definitely be eat here again
this be the bad medical experience of any kind -PRON- have ever experience
for the first appointment -PRON- drive 45 minute and once -PRON- arrive -PRON- be tell the appointment be cancel because someone call in sick
ok life happen so -PRON- be reschedule for the following week
-PRON- get a voicemail to be there at 8 the day before and when -PRON- show up just after 8 -PRON- take the co pay and -PRON- sit for 40 minute
at 845 -PRON- take the 830 appointment run 15 minute late)then call -PRON- up to say -PRON- miss -PRON- 8 a.m. exam and -PRON- would attempt to work -PRON- in hour later but no guarantee
-PRON- speak to the manager about the fact that -PRON- take -PRON- money have -PRON- sit give bad into then say -PRON- be not go to be able to perform service
and -PRON- be absolutely zero help
if -PRON- already run 15 + minute late as a standard practice there be no reason -PRON- could not have see -PRON- in the correct order
the paperwork be fill out in about 90 second and give back to -PRON-
the exam could have be do at 815
the waiting room be also pack because another staff member ex ray tech show up more than 30 minute late
but do -PRON- even apologize to any of those patient or give -PRON- a head up
no
of course not
go somewhere else
-PRON- be the bad
if -PRON- be a famous tv chef this be where -PRON- be sure -PRON- would spend most of -PRON- time stock up on everything delectable
since -PRON- be nothing close to a chef -PRON- go to st. lawrence market only from time to time and each time -PRON- be like a getaway in -PRON- own city

the building on the north side of front street usually contain food from local farmer fruit veggie meat dairy and pastry galore
-PRON- will also find hand craft jewelery clothing and art and this be the building for those look for deal or those with a knack for bargaining

bbq rib be far good than many of the one from most of the booth at the rib f -PRON- be well smoke and spicy but the bbq sauce be cold and not genereously brush on the rib thus why -PRON- think -PRON- be probably good for take out so -PRON- can reheat -PRON- with lot of bbq sauce on -PRON-

thank for keep -PRON- boy safe
-PRON- waitress be fantastic and the food ultimately be delicious
-PRON- be give this a four star review because -PRON- pittsburgh salad come out with no french fry and that be a pretty big faux pas
to be fair -PRON- do bring -PRON- out a side of super fresh really delicious french fry that -PRON- have be eat with ranch dress so not all be lose
the wing here be super good as be the brisket salad -PRON- smoke -PRON- meeting house and -PRON- certainly do a good job
the sandwich be just incredibly huge totally splittable actually everything on the menu be totally splittable unless -PRON- be in the mood for a serious eat experience quantity wise
be usually go for lunch just because go to the southside any evening during the week be a circus
especially thursday friday saturday even sunday -PRON- be undergrad central and everybody be out on the prowl an extra hammered
yvette be the good dog walker cat sitter and source of knowledge about all thing pet relate
-PRON- have take care of -PRON- pug norman since -PRON- be a baby
first -PRON- come for puppy visit and then one hour walk through the neigbourhood
-PRON- only service a small area and -PRON- travel on foot which mean -PRON- always get prompt reliable service
and -PRON- know -PRON- dog be actually get walk instead of drive around town in the back of a car
-PRON- happily acommodat special request such as alter a walk time so -PRON- can make -PRON- vet appointment
-PRON- will also make sure -PRON- dog be dress appropriately for the weather and manage to wiggle -PRON- dog into -PRON- boot and coat in the winter

yvette be great about keep in touch and be always only a quick phone call or email away if -PRON- have any question
one of the good feature of -PRON- service be -PRON- expectation that all the dog on -PRON- walk behave
-PRON- know that the obedience -PRON- have work on with -PRON- dog be reinforce on -PRON- daily walk
after hear so many horror story in -PRON- of leash park -PRON- be thrilled that -PRON- have yvette as -PRON- dog walker\/cat sitter
-PRON- agree with the previous reviewer that -PRON- only concern be that -PRON- will become too popular if other find out about -PRON-
never again
-PRON- purchase the deal through travelzoo before -PRON- arrive
when -PRON- sit down the waiter act like -PRON- do not know what the deal -PRON- be at first
-PRON- keep look then take a scanner out of -PRON- pocket and acknowledge -PRON- then explain the term of -PRON-
-PRON- definitely do not seem to happy about -PRON-
-PRON- ask if -PRON- have be before and -PRON- try to explain that chicago have one kind of like -PRON-
-PRON- cut -PRON- off then say ok salad bar be up there
-PRON- be sit near the bar and have to weave between other table waiter and other guest to get there
the plate be dirty and the salad bar be sloppy
the floor be unbelievably slippery
when -PRON- arrive back to -PRON- table there be a very pretty and obviously pricey bottle of spring water on -PRON- table
-PRON- awkwardly ask the waiter that -PRON- just want tap water and -PRON- say fine and take -PRON- off -PRON- table
the meat be ok
some be great some not
two other table fill next to -PRON- while -PRON- be there with similar deal and -PRON- act the same
the poor lady next to -PRON- have no clue how the process work and be ask -PRON- because the waiter do not explain -PRON-
if -PRON- want a relaxing and pleasant experience do not come here

-PRON- show -PRON- -PRON- id and -PRON- say -PRON- be good

-PRON- feel a hand slap across -PRON- chest and push -PRON- nearly off -PRON- foot
-PRON- look over and the bouncer be the one shove -PRON-
-PRON- say -PRON- tell -PRON- to f**k wait
that be literally the second sentence -PRON- have hear from -PRON-
if -PRON- misunderstood the first sentence that be fine but there be no excuse for the aggressive behavior of the bouncer
-PRON- be not a threat and would have stop walk in if someone have just ask -PRON-
-PRON- go with 2 vegetarian who 'd never have korean food

-PRON- be tell -PRON- need to locate and get the sign out of storage and -PRON- would call -PRON- back to schedule
well that be over a week ago and after several call and leave massage on the there voice mail -PRON- have come to the conclusion that either -PRON- have not find -PRON- sign or -PRON- be just a little bit too busy to return a phone call to let -PRON- know either way
when -PRON- call over and over again and -PRON- get an answering service
-PRON- suppose that be the first red flag
the customer service be great friendly barista
the hour be convenient for those who be night owl and enjoy drink coffee late at night like -PRON-
-PRON- have visit this coffee shop a few time and notice the hot size drink be a bit of a rip off than the cold size drink
-PRON- think one can get more from a drink when order an ice drink than a hot drink
-PRON- order a large talon chocolate hazelnut and vanilla coffee and a medium ice grand canyon coffee the size be equally the same as a medium ice drink
-PRON- recommend buy coffee from this location
-PRON- stay at this hotel over night and go to the hoover dam the next day
-PRON- wish -PRON- would of have more time to enjoy this hotel
-PRON- enjoy the historical atmosphere of the hotel along with the historical photo throughout the hallway and lobby
the room be retro but not outdated and give -PRON- the real feeling that -PRON- be stay in the hotel of the 1930 and 40
very clean and well maintain
the staff be excellent and very helpful despite -PRON- very late arrival
-PRON- appreciate the historical item in the room include the furniture and the book
-PRON- would love to stay at this hotel again if give the opportunity
there be a museum on site that -PRON- do not have the opportunity to visit due to -PRON- schedule
the breakfast be very good and include with -PRON- stay
if -PRON- be visit the hoover dam on -PRON- travel this hotel be a great way to start in the middle of historical boulder city and an easy drive to the dam
-PRON- believe that there be a historical society that help maintain this hotel good job and thank -PRON-

-PRON- favorite curry dish be the paneer makhani
favorite appetizer be the paneer pakora
the poori bread and the garlic naan be to die for
the service be a little slow but -PRON- be under the impression -PRON- be because -PRON- make -PRON- meal to order from scratch
-PRON- be totally worth the wait
eat here last night
and -PRON- use say the service be phenomenal
-PRON- meet the owner and -PRON- be delight
-PRON- take care of -PRON- as local for sure

-PRON- wait be unreal more than 30 min
not a well run place
and -PRON- microwave everything
eww the ten of -PRON- have spend the morning snowshoeing and -PRON- be hungry so
wait 40 minute to get seat in a half empty restaurant and be immediately tell with separate check -PRON- will take much long to get -PRON- food
40 minute later the waiter do not remember who order what food be cold the fish in the fish and chip be obviously freeze and be mushy
one of -PRON- diner ask for balsamic vinegar and be give soy sauce instead imagine -PRON- surprise
facility be worn and dirty
food on the worn and fray carpet wobbly chair etc -PRON- could go on
-PRON- suggestion
pack a lunch or perhaps try the lodge up the canyon

go back tomorrow to try the yummy look fish and chip
this be -PRON- childhood go to place be raise in so cal -PRON- either -PRON- like
in n out
or -PRON- take -PRON- out back and lynch -PRON-
good thing the quality of -PRON- burger have not change much
by -PRON- past review -PRON- know -PRON- do not scrimp on calorie if -PRON- be go to eat out eat out and in n out be no exception
for those of -PRON- come in from anywhere but ca az and nv maybe -PRON- be in utah and oregon now
-PRON- do not know)
-PRON- be in for a real treat
the menu be simple and ordering be as easy as 1 2 3 -PRON- be not just say that 1 combo be a double double fry and a drink 2 be a cheeseburger fry and a drink and 3 be a hamburger fry and a drink
however there be way to keep -PRON- burger not boring
-PRON- guess -PRON-
i'm talk about animal style roughly translate extra sauce extra cheese and extra grill onion
-PRON- favorite meal and probably one -PRON- would pick before -PRON- go and meet the lord someday many moon from now be a 1 animal style well do fry take a bit longer but well worth the wait rootbeer and if -PRON- be feel saucy which be pretty common
-PRON- go for the vanilla milkshake
this be a great place for -PRON- anklebiter too
-PRON- give the kid free sticker at the cashier and -PRON- will slice up a burger so -PRON- can share just say -PRON- want a kid hamburger or cheeseburger cut up
will always come to in n out because -PRON- tasty cheap and -PRON- just what -PRON- do
absolutely love uber
use -PRON- in chicago denver and now that -PRON- just move to the phoenix area -PRON- have use -PRON- here
-PRON- be amazing and will never use a regular taxi again
with the addition of uberx uber really have -PRON- dial in here in az
finally get to try le tablier rouge the other day while wander by -PRON- in that area
-PRON- be base in ahuntsic in the north of montreal along fleury street
by the look the restaurant look like a dinner type fill with small table and a small counter that serve take out meal as well as a variety of meat cheese and salad
anywho as for the order -PRON- have a burger and a poutine
burger be pretty average consider -PRON- have high expectation because of the many review discuss on urban spoon
nonetheless the meat still taste fresh and -PRON- be obvious -PRON- have a beef of high quality
the poutine be exceptional although -PRON- be not for everyone consider the meat chosen(forgot the name and that -PRON- sort of taste like spicy meat sauce
-PRON- be indeed not for everyone because the fry be serve soft due to the sauce but -PRON- do believe that -PRON- be very original and different of other place that serve poutine across the city
a big note -PRON- do the mistake to take the poutine by -PRON- which -PRON- do not finish and thereby have to bring home as takeout for late dinner easily fee two or three person
to conclude -PRON- do believe that this place be worth a visit and -PRON- will gladly return to try the other item of -PRON- menu such as -PRON- hot dog or insane sandwich that make -PRON- salivate from the look of the menu
enjoy fellow yelpers -PRON- be worth the move up north of the island
-PRON- favorite pizza in vegas
-PRON- always order the mediterranean salad add salami
-PRON- always crisp fresh ingredient delicious vinaigrette dressing
a glass of napa cellars chardonnay perfectly chill
and a large meatball ricotta sundri tomato top with fresh basil pizza so -PRON- always have leftover to go
absolutely devine
extremely poor service
-PRON- come in and wait a few minute for waitress to attend -PRON- for -PRON- drink
-PRON- then order right away and after 15 minute of wait -PRON- still do not have -PRON- meal
-PRON- ask why -PRON- salad and two lettuce wrap burger be not ready yet
waitress say a worker from the kitchen leave because -PRON- have a emotionally meltdown
few minute later -PRON- wait and food finally arrive
-PRON- be miss -PRON- side of broccoli
-PRON- get that a couple minute later
then -PRON- order zucchini fry and here -PRON- be still wait for -PRON- fry after 30 minute of wait
let -PRON- be honest
if -PRON- have a choice between go to get -PRON- car service or have a root canal -PRON- would be a hard choice
camelback vw service change all of that
-PRON- have be there on two occasion and the last time mark -PRON- service consultant make the process so easy include get -PRON- into a rental -PRON- have definitely give -PRON- a different opinion
prompt courteous helpful and accommodate
thank -PRON-
-PRON- order the palak paneer spinach with cheese for dinner and -PRON- be like most other palak paneers
-PRON- have have in the past nothing too special
-PRON- come with rice
-PRON- main reason for give -PRON- 3 star instead of more be that the service be a bit slow and the portion be not very substantial for a dinner meal especially for the price
would -PRON- go back
maybe for the buffet but not for dinner
good than -PRON- expect
have such a large menu that -PRON- initially think -PRON- would not execute anything well
but decent asian chicken salad very fresh and tasty -PRON- dining partner have egg with giant hash brown puck and another have the steak taco special
all enjoy though -PRON- understand the salsa be very very spicy
seem like a solid place for food but not overly gourmet
-PRON- be write this review for other guy who be husband and boyfriend
maybe guy who be not really so much into the theater like -PRON- maybe guy who just go to the show for -PRON- significant other
-PRON- be a big beatles fan
-PRON- do not love the theater actor or drama but -PRON- be always fascinate by movement of staging light etc and nothing be go to stop mrs. h. from see this show on -PRON- trip
-PRON- luck out scoring seat in the fourth row but -PRON- be sure every seat in the place be great
the sound be perfect in every direction combine with speaker in -PRON- seat front and back
-PRON- have read other review complain that this show somehow be not athletic or acrobatic enough
wtf
sure maybe other cirque show have more crazy rowdy acrobatic but love certainly do not lack for amazing physical feat particularly by the aerial performer
-PRON- highly recommend go to the cirque web site prior to attend the show to familiarize -PRON- with the director 's interpretation of the character
have this not be recommend to -PRON- -PRON- would probably be kind of lost and just listen like the show be a jukebox
instead -PRON- be treat to a cast of character derive from element of each beatles song
-PRON- will be surprised at how these element be not confine to the song -PRON- would think -PRON- belong in
grab a drink or two at the beatles love revo bar before go in then tune out and tune in
thumb up would go again
this place be dirty and food be very average plus be expensive for what -PRON- get
to add insult to injury -PRON- charge -PRON- debit card twice
-PRON- discover the next day happen because new girl be train on the register
do not save -PRON- receipt
so guess -PRON- be just out of luck
at least maybe -PRON- can save someone the disappointment of eat there with -PRON- review
-PRON- have be to high end hair stylist all over la and new york and emily just crush -PRON- all
in one session -PRON- give -PRON- that cut -PRON- have be aim for for year correct the color to make -PRON- look year young cure a stubborn cowlick problem and teach -PRON- how to do -PRON- own hair so -PRON- come out right
-PRON- be talented skilled a good listener and so intelligent in -PRON- approach
-PRON- can put -PRON- all together
and -PRON- be sweet
-PRON- be will return again and again
-PRON- actually have an amazing server who be patient and really kind with -PRON- poor french and really helpful to -PRON- as an out of towner
the beer be serve with a smile
however -PRON- be give -PRON- two star for -PRON- horrible and extremely rude manager
-PRON- server have dial -PRON- own telephone line for -PRON- to use to contact -PRON- carpool driver after -PRON- inform -PRON- -PRON- could not call long distance
-PRON- have -PRON- the number a quebec register area code number and -PRON- politely hand -PRON- the phone
minutes later the manager appear and grab the phone out of -PRON- hand
-PRON- accuse -PRON- of call long distance
-PRON- say sorry inform -PRON- -PRON- be a quebec number to which -PRON- reply no -PRON- be not
-PRON- then walk away with the telephone and scold -PRON- waiter which -PRON- could see
-PRON- feel horrible for -PRON- who be only try to help -PRON-
then to make thing bad -PRON- walk around with the cordless phone to tell all other employee about this grand offense whilst look and point -PRON- out to all waiter and even the cook for some reason
-PRON- feel like a child that have -PRON- hand smack by -PRON- mother
this kind of treatment be just absolutely unacceptable
-PRON- have never write a review before but as a server
-PRON- know that tell the server will not help
-PRON- do not want -PRON- to have to tell -PRON- manager that -PRON- be a horrible customer service representative and actually just a rude person in general
hand down -PRON- favorite bar in cleveland
-PRON- live down the street when -PRON- be in undergrad when -PRON- be the old man store
then -PRON- close and -PRON- get word -PRON- be go to re open as a bar
-PRON- feel like -PRON- take forever the anticipation be terrible
then finally -PRON- open
-PRON- really take -PRON- all by shock
-PRON- have -PRON- expectation for bar in little italy like lou 's tavern and do not expect something that look like -PRON- be steal from manhattan
the freakin light all have network address so -PRON- can be program
this place be swanky
but yet -PRON- be still the oms that use to sell -PRON- six pack
be just down the street and have a large group of friend in walking distance -PRON- be be way too easy to show up with 20 people and just take over the bar
and $ 4 for a large amber bock
god -PRON- miss this bar
-PRON- stop by every time -PRON- be in town
michael ang and keith keep -PRON- up
the staff at this jack in the box be always sooo friendly and t here food be always nice and hot
love this one
good food but -PRON- think -PRON- be lie about not use msg in -PRON- food
msg make -PRON- very thirsty
but be warn ask for a 10 in spicy and -PRON- may get a 3 ask for a 2 and -PRON- get a 9
very unreliable
-PRON- do have great delivery man who will make -PRON- order right when -PRON- get -PRON- wrong which be often
overall this be probably the good thai food in las vegas
go to macayo 's order the baja pizza
worst ever no longer a fan of there food
all -PRON- have on -PRON- be some spicy cheesy sauce and -PRON- order -PRON- with pork instead of chicken
to -PRON- dismay the amount of pork could fit on a teaspoon
-PRON- use to have a happy hour that be not present
happy hour
also find out there well tequila be piss poor
so order a premium margarita
good luck on quality of food
great value manicure pedicure although a little over book on a saturday
-PRON- get the standard spa mani pedi and -PRON- hold up ~1.5 week which be pretty impressive
as other review say -PRON- be a mom and son run operation
and -PRON- do a pretty good job
great for the price
good filipino food in town
great atmosphere
-PRON- go on a couple night -PRON- have entertainment and -PRON- really now how to show people a great time
take the family again next week
-PRON- favorite sushi place
-PRON- have be frequent this place for the last 4 year
-PRON- hot green tea be strong and hot just the way -PRON- like -PRON-
this place have the good rainbow roll
the rainbow roll and crunchy california roll be a must
the service be good and -PRON- have recently remodel
the place look good
the challenge with base a restaurant concept on a food group that 95 of the population can master be risky
but if -PRON- can do -PRON- that much good than -PRON- average joe -PRON- get -PRON- a winner
this be the success behind reggies -PRON- basic homestyle sandwich but with the just the right amount of everything to make -PRON- outstanding
-PRON- go with the monte cristo and what catch -PRON- eye about this be that beyond the turkey\/ham combo the bread be apparently dip in egg and cook like french toast first
-PRON- be humungous especially with a side of fry that -PRON- barely finish
-PRON- tend to have special combo write on the sandwich board outside which -PRON- do not really promote indoor so -PRON- have to ask about -PRON- to get the deal pull pork sandwich combo for 10 buck flat
-PRON- be hard to justify pay 9 dollar for a sandwich on a regular basis but for a fill treat once in a while -PRON- be all good
service be very friendly though the pretty lass work the cash seem a little unfamiliar with the menu
perhaps a newbie
atmosphere be rustic and lay back just like -PRON- sandwich
and yes sandwich be -PRON- own food group
-PRON- have always have a great experience here
the sauce be all at least good tasting some of -PRON- a bit thick for -PRON- taste -PRON- favorite be the atomic
have not actually have the bone in chicken wing but between the tender and the boneless wing the tender be definitely -PRON- favorite
this seem like -PRON- may use a high caliber of chicken or maybe just cook -PRON- better than some of the other wing place because -PRON- boneless wing definitely seem juicier and less stringy than some of the other wing place on carson
the bread be great too just the right amount of crunch not too thick and not too floury
-PRON- manage to get the chicken to stay crispy despite be douse in sauce something not too many place seem to get right for boneless wing
the interior of the restaurant be not much to talk about just a counter where -PRON- order -PRON- food then a seating area where -PRON- can wait for -PRON- to bring -PRON- out
-PRON- place an online order for carry out last time and -PRON- work perfectly phone ordering be an option as well
delivery would be the icing on the cake
-PRON- take an excursion to the new hoover dam bypass today and stop here on -PRON- way back
this be -PRON- last chance starbucks go to hoover dam and first chance come back
-PRON- be the only starbucks here in boulder city
-PRON- be locate at the turn off for hoover dam and get a lot of traffic from people come and go
-PRON- coffee taste good
there be plenty of indoor seating here and a little veranda with outdoor seating
-PRON- be not -PRON- favorite starbucks location but -PRON- be glad -PRON- be here
save -PRON- from unnecesary restaurant pain and go somewhere else for real mexican food
-PRON- usually do not do restaurant bashing but sometimes -PRON- be just a guy civic duty
this place be like somebody in switzerland 's idea of a real southwest mexican restaurant
the place be cavernous with decour ala taiwan import company
the food be bland and -PRON- could probably find more authenticity eat stouffers
margarita 's be overprice but ok
how can -PRON- screw up a margarita
besides that -PRON- be a great place for another restaurant
to be honest -PRON- be super pissed and want to give this place a bad review base on -PRON- app
-PRON- could not use the money -PRON- load onto the card but -PRON- gosh
the drink be so amazing
-PRON- husband get the pumpkin spice chai
and -PRON- get a blended caramel
and wow
amazing
more like a dessert than a drink
-PRON- will just rate the app badly in the app store
-PRON- be surprised that -PRON- could not just type in the card info manually like other coffee store
-PRON- would say -PRON- will not be back but let -PRON- be honest the coffee be way too phenomenal
-PRON- can not go wrong with tetsu
-PRON- do a chef 's selection tasting menu for -PRON- and everything be outstanding and the staff be wonderful
-PRON- and -PRON- partner spot this on be first day in edinburgh and think -PRON- must go in as -PRON- look lovely
the second day -PRON- need somewere for breakfast as -PRON- do not get any with the hotel so think -PRON- would give -PRON- a go -PRON- order a scottish breakfast with tea and fresh orange juice -PRON- be really nice and fresh
-PRON- get two different type of sausage bacon tomato mushroom black pudding haggi toast and a potato cake
the place be modern and traditional mixed together and the staff be really friendly
-PRON- also go in for a drink -PRON- be lovely
-PRON- sit in the window so -PRON- could watch the world go by
-PRON- have a vodka and coke and -PRON- partner have a beer -PRON- also share some deep fry avocado which be unusual but really tasty
-PRON- would recommend this bar
-PRON- be a really great place will definitely be go again when -PRON- be next in edinburgh
if -PRON- be look for a good quality ramen then sakanaya -PRON- be
when -PRON- go there for the grand opening of course there be a lot of people but -PRON- raman look very oily and -PRON- be not very hot
the food be relatively warm rather than hot and the meat be very thick and have a difficult time chew
at least at sakanaya -PRON- slice the meat into a small portion for the customer to eat but ozu ramen -PRON- guess -PRON- do not care
the broth have no flavor and the color of the broth be not what -PRON- expect
-PRON- go back again hop that -PRON- will change the system and the food a little bit but -PRON- be still the same
if sakanaya be fill with customer then ozu ramen be -PRON- next choice but would not recommend if -PRON- be look for a quality raman
at least try -PRON- once and decide if -PRON- be worth the time and money
-PRON- enjoy go to snooze but -PRON- do not think -PRON- will go back
first off the wait to get in to this place be ridiculous
the food be not quite good enough to merit the wait in other word the food quality to wait ratio be a bit off
do not get -PRON- wrong the food be good and even good than most breakfast place but at the end of the day -PRON- would much rather wait for something incredible rather than good
the atmosphere of the place be super weird
-PRON- be like the jetsons meet -PRON- grandmother newly redone kitchen
do not really mesh well
at the end of the meal -PRON- be satisfied but -PRON- ask -PRON- do this feel unique and -PRON- answer be no
in all aspect -PRON- feel like a chain restaurant
the service be friendly but not personal
the food be tasty but not exceptional
-PRON- think three star be the right score and a ok be the right rating
terrible service

the place be clean
and -PRON- can get just about everything -PRON- be look for

this review be base on sell book or pardon -PRON- try to sell a book
-PRON- recently read on here that -PRON- take book
ok sound good to -PRON-
-PRON- have get many a book -PRON- have to buy for university not textbook think general light

one of which be a charles dickens book
-PRON- be really big and -PRON- do have multiple copy of book if i do not know good -PRON- would say -PRON- be a new bookstore
anyways move right along
-PRON- see the sell desk and -PRON- ask the guy at the front where -PRON- go to see if -PRON- will take -PRON- book
-PRON- point -PRON- over to the empty counter
-PRON- wait for five minute go back and ask the guy at the front be there anyone work there
yeah -PRON- should be back soon
another ten minute go by and finally some guy come
-PRON- tell -PRON- that -PRON- would like to know if -PRON- book be worth anything
as -PRON- take -PRON- out of the bag -PRON- roughly grab -PRON- out of -PRON- hand flip through -PRON- all and say no -PRON- can not take any of these
ok no need to be so rough about -PRON-
geez
-PRON- think -PRON- devalue whatev -PRON- book be worth
what really make -PRON- confused be if -PRON- know by look at the cover -PRON- be not any good why do -PRON- have to flip through -PRON-
-PRON- do not bother use the computer to look up the value of -PRON- book
-PRON- be guess the computer be use to look up price unless the computer be for aesthetic purpose only
-PRON- book be gently use in really good condition no crease or pen mark
but after -PRON- roughly go through -PRON- -PRON- be not so sure
please do not man handle the book if -PRON- have no intention of take -PRON- because -PRON- not what -PRON- interested in
-PRON- seem as though -PRON- have inconvenience -PRON- by make -PRON- wait fifteen minute
dude be in a huff mood for sure
-PRON- have some cookbook one that be sign by renowned chef martin yan
however if -PRON- plan on sell book here -PRON- suggest -PRON- go donate -PRON- instead of waste -PRON- time haul the book here only to have to wait and when -PRON- be finally serve make to feel like -PRON- be do -PRON- a favor by make -PRON- look at your worthless book
be this what go to a pawnshop feel like
there bowl be what -PRON- usually go for and the usual add on item be okay
this location by unlv be pretty crowded when school be in session so later on in the afternoon be good for a visit
just the good food and dinner experience of -PRON- 5 day stay in vegas
like another yelper -PRON- be a bit skeptical give that -PRON- be a very small restaurant tuck by the side of the food court so -PRON- actually check -PRON- out the night before
-PRON- be not disappointed in the least
sat inside only a little claustrophobic but not bad hubby have veal parmigiana the big piece of veal ever and absolutely delicious -PRON- have the shrimp scampi and -PRON- share a caesar salad no room for dessert but would have like to have try one of the many choice and john be attentive and have a sense of humor hard to find in most of the stuffy vegas restaurant
if -PRON- like authentic italian food and atmosphere -PRON- will like trattoria reggiano
will definitely return
the good item be -PRON- calamari salad with pepper
the sushi be just average at good
many roll or plate be very american not japanese sushi
the service be good and the wait staff very friendly
-PRON- be a shame there be not good sushi place in the west side of phoenix metro
friendly atmosphere and great coaching
-PRON- would highly recommend this box to anyone look to crossfit in the area
the box have a nice feel to -PRON- and -PRON- have great equipment
the run area be open and safe and -PRON- have more than enough room to toss weight around
great place for breakfast sat prime rib or drink
friendly staff quick service wit a large number of take out order
why
the decor be old
-PRON- think -PRON- be part of the charm but some do not like fish and deer on the wall watch -PRON- eat or panel from the 70
the fish fry be hit and miss sometime great sometimes old fish tasting
no wonder why this place have bad review
-PRON- only go because of the mechanical bull but -PRON- be break
then -PRON- get -PRON- drink and when -PRON- start to sip on -PRON-
-PRON- see there be a fly
so when -PRON- try to go take -PRON- back
the bartender claim that -PRON- must have somehow get in -PRON- drink inbetween the 30 second 10 ft walk from obtain -PRON- drink and refuse to remake the drink
-PRON- have even give a decent tip
ugh what a disappointment -PRON- will never go back
pro customer service be great quality of print be great ease of ordering be not bad con
-PRON- be pretty pricey quantity break be too high -PRON- do have a error or two over the year but -PRON- fix -PRON- overall a pretty good experience and -PRON- will continue to use -PRON-
pushy scammer can not wait to throw -PRON- into a chair and rub some gunk on -PRON- eyes\/wrinkle wait til 3 hour later when white flake start come off of -PRON- face where -PRON- apply -PRON- all natural and all organic not
creams\/gels\/serum and -PRON- skin redden
-PRON- modus operandi be very smooth-
lot of fast talk
-PRON- act as if -PRON- be under no obligation to try the profuct but after -PRON- have try -PRON- -PRON- be basically write an order for you- if -PRON- can not afford -PRON- top package -PRON- will bargain with -PRON- to work -PRON- down so that -PRON- do not leave without buy something
the packaging of these product be very deceptive- there be no ingredient list on the bottles\/jar -PRON- which be be demonstrate on -PRON-
the saleswoman assure -PRON- that the product be completely 100 natural and organic yet -PRON- have no product literature available in store
-PRON- direct -PRON- to pull up www.adoreorganicinnovations.com website for full product information on a store provide ipad however this occur in a harry manner and -PRON- be not able to find any product information on this website
-PRON- buy some of these product because -PRON- do see some temporary wrinkle reduction from them- -PRON- be ship to -PRON-
when -PRON- receive -PRON- -PRON- see that the packaging of the cosmetic be carefully construct so that -PRON- have to cut open the seal and lift a flap in order to see the side panel where the ingredient be list
how bogus be that
-PRON- cross check the ingredient in one of the product with the environmental working group 's website- holy moly -PRON- may as well be smear an invitation to multi organ toxicity and cancer on -PRON- face
-PRON- feel that le savon be misrepresent these product as something -PRON- be not
-PRON- have a no refund policy
-PRON- dispute the charge with -PRON- credit card company
-PRON- give -PRON- one star because the product do work for about 4 hour with noticeable firming before flake and redden -PRON- skin the next day

-PRON- drink be always fill and clutter be remove asap
-PRON- think -PRON- have find -PRON- new breakfast spot
-PRON- have be here a few time this be -PRON- last time here the operation be run so poorly some of the new staff have no idea about cusotmer service
-PRON- be be 20 minute since -PRON- drop -PRON- car off
and -PRON- be still sit there wait to be vacuumed
a 15 dollar car wash and -PRON- should have learn
-PRON- lesson last time because -PRON- get the 20 dollar car wash and -PRON- seat and mat be still leave dirty
-PRON- should of learn -PRON- lesson and
-PRON- should -PRON- -PRON- the bad experience and do not come here ever
if rather wash -PRON- car with a dirty dish rag
40 minute to get -PRON- car wash
half way through -PRON- ask the guy how -PRON- be do on time
-PRON- say
oh -PRON- be do great on time
-PRON-
what a douche
however the manager of the car wash handle -PRON- like a pro
-PRON- name be robert and -PRON- be fantastic
-PRON- already good revue about eatt but this time -PRON- be maybe the good -PRON- ever eat
-PRON- be vegan for the past 2 and 1\/2 year
and -PRON- do not remember have such an amazing vegan meal
-PRON- stop by to try -PRON- new menu and -PRON- be blow away how good -PRON- be
now all vegan do have a place to eat in las vegas
atmosphere be great very different
-PRON- be busy but the place be so big that -PRON- do not have to wait
food be great
pork belly nachos stand out on the appetizer menu -PRON- be as good as -PRON- sound
the prime rib sandwich be also excellent
highly recommend
starve in the late afternoon -PRON- head here think that if nothing else -PRON- 3 year old would eat pizza
-PRON- mistake this be not a hurry and eat kind of place
-PRON- be a sit down relax this could take 2 hours+ sort of affair
-PRON- lunch portion be giant
-PRON- would hate to see what -PRON- serve for dinner
-PRON- literally eat 2 more meal from -PRON- leftover
so while -PRON- be on the more expensive side compare to like olive garden -PRON- be way good food
and -PRON- will get -PRON- money worth
this sheraton be on the ground of the airport in cleveland
-PRON- get a great last minute rate at hoteltonighr.com
the checkin process be smooth and pleasant
the attendant set -PRON- up in a corner room with a view of the sunset
the bed be really really comfortable with 4 pillow on each bed
the pool be heated and clean the hottub be awesome
-PRON- do not get to eat at the hemisphere restaurant but hear other say -PRON- food and service be really good
there be also a starbucks convenience store in the lobby
even
be right on the airport ground -PRON- do not hear any airline traffic and the curtain on the window close out any bright light
highly recommend
let -PRON- start off by say that the man that come to move the actual stuff be great
matt emmanuel be awesome
-PRON- do -PRON- job well
-PRON- only qualm with -PRON- be that -PRON- wrap every box and thing that -PRON- could even though -PRON- ask -PRON- not to
there be vas and lamp value at 10 $ and -PRON- wrap -PRON-
-PRON- eat up time and money that -PRON- do not have
back to the review
jc culmer the owner of the establishment quote -PRON- move at 3.5 hour and 2 man
once the guy walk in -PRON- make the comment that -PRON- be the job of 4 man
even -PRON- know the estimate be a lowball
there be no contact until the day of
-PRON- email jc an inventory of only the big item not an exhaustive list
-PRON- must have think -PRON- be gospel
the guy be an hour late and in the end the total bill be double the estimate
-PRON- be no fault of the mover -PRON- but of the owner
unfortunately -PRON- be not able to tip matt emmanuel because -PRON- have stop at the atm already and only get so much cash out
if -PRON- end up work with this company -PRON- would demand constant communication and send an exhaustive inventory of -PRON- item
double check that the time be go to cover -PRON- move
be from out of town -PRON- hear about this place from some of -PRON- classmate
since then -PRON- have go several time and -PRON- have to admit how much -PRON- love this place
the have a great salt caramel brownie tea cake and tart
-PRON- have order soup before as well the sweet potato bisque and -PRON- think -PRON- be one of the good soup -PRON- have ever eat
and -PRON- be open 24 hour
what more could a college student ask for
good coffee which -PRON- have
and the decor be quite eclectic
-PRON- just love the furniture and the ambiance of the place
-PRON- have a very artsy feel to -PRON- which be quite comforting to -PRON-
the only down side to this place be the price of item
yes everything be very delicious but -PRON- pay for the quality of the item
-PRON- buy a cup of soup there which come with a small slice of baguette a brownie and a coffee
this come to just over $ 8
-PRON- be good but a little steep
the signage be horrible and there be too many spot where poorly design space create bottleneck of crowd
there be some bit that be nice than other york concourse but the main area where people filter in through the ttc and the path be still over capacity and there seem to be never end construction
come in with -PRON- daughter to try the place out
-PRON- do a build -PRON- own bowl and -PRON- do the greek
-PRON- get -PRON- food get home and the do not put in the avocado that -PRON- put in -PRON- build -PRON- own
-PRON- call -PRON- and all that be say to -PRON- be sorry and next time -PRON- come in -PRON- will give -PRON- extra avocado and basically -PRON- hang up
not really impressed with how -PRON- handle -PRON-
finally get to check out fabo
-PRON- expectations\/hype be meet and exceed
go here to kill some time and to study a little bit
parking be a bit of a pain but -PRON- be sure people that live off of selwyn love this place to walk down to
actually get park in the back parking lot and come in from the back
-PRON- be warmly greet by warmth
-PRON- be cold outside artwork and aroma of good eats\/drink
after -PRON- get over -PRON- initial impression of this free spirited place -PRON- be peruse through -PRON- menu and ask the staff if -PRON- have recommendation
-PRON- end up go with a chai tea latte which be very tasty and very affordable
-PRON- be look for a table to study on so there be some nestled in different area all of which be occupy
-PRON- end up on the couch which at first -PRON- think -PRON- could not sit on since some of the furniture have price tag on -PRON-
make sure to ask first but the store employee probably think -PRON- be crazy at this point
say -PRON- be welcome to sit anywhere
those piece just happen to be on sale if -PRON- be look to buy furniture
the artwork be great to look at
-PRON- need to check out how often -PRON- switch -PRON- out
-PRON- be sure -PRON- be very refreshing to have new art on the wall to look at while grab a brew or some of the delicious treat that fabo have to offer
what make the pizza here so good
-PRON- be make in the italian way perfect over century as the street food of the poor the edible equivalent of the opera also once a poor person 's entertainment
the base be make by hand in the kitchen not by machine in a food service warehouse
-PRON- take two day to make the dough so -PRON- ferment properly thereby violate the money make first rule of quick turnover which have kill all ferment in the mainstream food industry
the base be thin good for people watch waistline and bake in a woodfired oven for under two minute so the fresh ingredient be not over cook
and the cheese be make to order for the restaurant fresh from ontario not bulk cheese buy cheap from the milk pool
alas pizza come to north america during the 1950 before country become protectionist about -PRON- food culture so junkfood operator be able to call -PRON- adulterate version pizza
an organization to protect the pizza do not develop until the 1980 when the trend be too far go
-PRON- deal with effort to defend local food the product of local culture and local place that should be protect from highjack if the name be to be use in -PRON- book the no nonsense guide to world food
-PRON- be not just yeast that give a rise to the pizza dough -PRON- be an entire culture and a method now celebrate by the slow food movement bear of all place in italy
understaffed af
all server be constantly busy -PRON- sit down 15min before get water and another 15min before get any attention
hand down best in the burgh this pizza be so unique and delicious
who can eat anything else
this menu go from delicious to addictive
from pizza to hoagie to wing
-PRON- be epic
brutal commitment to time promise
not worth waste -PRON- whole day wait for -PRON-
do not use
make appointment 11\/29 for january
-PRON- would think that -PRON- could schedule that effectively
not!. between 12 2 promise
now 3:10
not only still wait but have not hear from driver as promise
find a different provider
after post driver show up
make good on the deal
change -PRON- review
-PRON- like this store
-PRON- help -PRON- to figure out that -PRON- be over overpronat when -PRON- run and get -PRON- in the right kind of shoe
-PRON- would recommend -PRON- to anybody
-PRON- first visit here
-PRON- opt for 60 minute full body massage
if -PRON- opt for the $ 5.00 upgrade for oil and eucalyptus please be prepared to remove -PRON- top
-PRON- will be face down
the oil be very therapeutic and -PRON- will feel a menthol sensation hot and cold but a heavy towel will be place on -PRON- back to keep the chill out
-PRON- feel great overall
if -PRON- do not like finger in -PRON- ear say something because -PRON- be a part of the facial massage
eek
wear stretchy clothe like yoga gear and lady put -PRON- hair up in a bun
-PRON- be easy for both -PRON- and the therapist
-PRON- bring a small pillow to place underneath -PRON- low back for extra support
the music be soothe and -PRON- be give a little cup of water as -PRON- exit the spa
-PRON- would have give five star if -PRON- massage guy would not have just take a smoke before see -PRON-
-PRON- can not stand the smell of tobacco
but -PRON- block -PRON- out and enjoy -PRON- overall experience
the thing -PRON- do to finally get that massage can surprise -PRON-
thank
-PRON- will be back
p.s.
the receptionist be really nice and speak english
fake or rather condescend service from the service manager"
and -PRON- do not even acknowledge -PRON- when -PRON- ask the status of -PRON- car uh more like ignore
end every sentence with an impolite no madam or yes madam
ya get the scenario
basically the guy be a real jerk
-PRON- could not even figure out how to fix -PRON- car even when -PRON- tell -PRON- what be wrong with -PRON- have be diagnose at the dealership
two guy be sit there star at the computer as if -PRON- be go to magically speak to -PRON-
at least -PRON- do not charge -PRON- but what a waste of time wait for 90 minute
come for all the positive review on yelp but this place do not really impress -PRON-
first -PRON- service be not bad but definitely lack of organization skill
-PRON- call the place at 5:30 or 6 pm see if -PRON- be possible to make a reservation at 7 p.m.
but -PRON- be tell that the place get really busy on a thursday night
so -PRON- do not let -PRON- make a reservation until 8:45 pm and
surely that be so late for a dinner
so -PRON- and -PRON- friend decide to show up at 7:30 anyways if -PRON- could not get a table -PRON- would din in elsewhere
so -PRON- arrive the place at roughly 7:40 the din area inside be completely empty and even the patio only have like 5 table two person per table so i0 customer
-PRON- would not call this busy but perhaps -PRON- have a different definition in term of busy
the atmosphere though be lovely
when -PRON- walk into the restaurant -PRON- would see most of the wall have hand painting on
-PRON- find this pretty attractive
and sure this place would be a great spot to hang out and grab a drink
-PRON- be nice weather
so -PRON- sit at the patio and between the two of -PRON- -PRON- have 5 taco two drink and a guacamole to share
-PRON- taco be average size and -PRON- probably would need 2 3 taco to make enough for a meal
let -PRON- start with the guacamole $ 8)
-PRON- think -PRON- be a little pricy
but -PRON- like how -PRON- have pomegranate seed in -PRON-
love that touch of sweetness
-PRON- find the chip thou be a little too hard but -PRON- be free to refill
and -PRON- do end up like the guacamole more than the taco -PRON- serve
-PRON- only serve corn tortilla shell
and -PRON- only serve two taco at a time one for each of -PRON- so the table would not be fill with plate as the table there be tiny
-PRON- have bistec sirloin carnitas pork shoulder barbacoa braise lamb camarones shrimp and pescado beer batter branzino fry fish
-PRON- think both carnita pork shoulder $ 5 and barbacoa braise lamb $ 6.5 have the good value and -PRON- also taste the good
chunk of juicy meat and the lime juice balance out the flavour
but the lamb taste be a little plain need a pint of salt perhaps to kick the fav more
bistec sirloin $ 7 slightly pricy
with this price -PRON- expect there would be a little bit more meat or the meat be not so ground
-PRON- chop up the meat into very small piece but -PRON- guess this be how people make authentic mexican taco
but the most surprising part be -PRON- be pretty sure -PRON- order the non spicy one
but one bite of this taco surely burn -PRON- month and stomach
-PRON- admit -PRON- have a very low tolerance but maybe -PRON- should warn other that even the non spicy sirloin taco be sort of spicy
camarone shrimp $ 7 the shrimp do not come in a whole piece but -PRON- chop -PRON- up into small piece
and the portion -PRON- give this time be nothing like what the other post on yelp before
-PRON- be sure there be probably only 2.5 -3 small shrimp in the taco
but that be not the bad part this taco be another fire in the mouth
-PRON- be so spicy -PRON- could not even taste what be in the taco honestly
-PRON- should really adjust the spicy level
lastly -PRON- have the pescado beer batter branzino fry fish $ 8
-PRON- think $ 8 be pretty pricey for taco and also because -PRON- do not taste great
the deep fry layer be so hard
-PRON- be almost like chew fry cardboard
and pink pickle radish on top be super sour
-PRON- do not like this at all
but -PRON- guess -PRON- be a mistake to order fry fish in a mexican place although the taco -PRON- look gorgeous
-PRON- can not say -PRON- be a big fan of mexican food
or -PRON- really know what be authentic mexican food but -PRON- know next time if -PRON- want taco
-PRON- would go seven life and or else where
just because -PRON- have good value
but this place for sure -PRON- be still a great spot to hang out
-PRON- have to say this place beat kintaro on church even tho -PRON- like kintaro 's polar beer
both zakkushi and kintaro be yakitori japanese skewer bar and -PRON- quality of yakitori be good
-PRON- feel that zakkushi have more option and every dish of -PRON- have a same good quality whereas dish other than yakitori be not so great in kintaro
5\/5
tonshabu salad $ 6 full of flavour
4.5\/5
oden chef 's pick $ 6.8 come with daikon tofu ikamaki(fish cake with squid shirataki and chikuwa
-PRON- do not see a lot of oden in toronto
-PRON- be so excited about -PRON-
daikon and ikamaki be -PRON- favourite
skewers -PRON- order
5\/5 wagyu beef $ 6.8 -PRON- just want more umeshiso yaki $ 1.9
-PRON- love the sourness and a hint of japanese basil on the chicken thigh
nice combination
4.5\/5 oropon beef $ 2.5 love -PRON-
the onion really do a good job so that -PRON- can just keep earr -PRON- without feel greasy
4 star cuz -PRON- have the wagyu beef 4\/5
p toro $ 2 cheese yaki $ 1.9
mé maki $ 1.9 eringi $ 2 zucchini $ 1.7
horumon decent flavour just the way -PRON- want -PRON- to be
good but not so much surprise momo $ 1.6 teriyaki and sea salt
-PRON- usually prefer sea salt with skewer like this
but here in zakkushi -PRON- like the teriyaki a bit more
3\/5 quail egg wrap w\/ pork $ 2.1 neither -PRON- friend
nor -PRON- could really taste the pork
-PRON- taste just like normal hard boil egg cook in soy sauce
tofu(w\/ soy sauce $ 2 can not really taste the soy sauce
-PRON- be just to bland to be a decent bar food
drink
-PRON- order
3.5\/5 lemon honey soda regular sweet lemon honey infuse soda
4\/5 umeshu+pineapple juice very tropical
definitely a girl drink cuz -PRON- can hardly taste any alcohol in -PRON-
this be a very average place to eat for the price and be in vegas
although -PRON- mussel be sandy and -PRON- have break shell in -PRON- risotto
yes very delicious
after check out the beautiful state capital building -PRON- head to the food truck
-PRON- would read the review so order the sweet and spicy thai chicken wrap with extra sauce
-PRON- be yummy for sure and fresh
very good
-PRON- have a special that be a latin wrap and -PRON- hubby snarf -PRON- down
-PRON- be lunchtime busy as heck and these folk just crank the food out as efficiently as anything
so read the rest of the review and stop by this place
worth -PRON- for sure
-PRON- always mess up -PRON- order every time -PRON- get a salad
-PRON- be wrong
-PRON- order lemonade -PRON- be diet
get old
-PRON- salas today be miss the side
people at work keep talk about this place say -PRON- have the good burrito in town
finally have -PRON- about a week ago order a steak burrito -PRON- be pretty good
unlike other cheesy burrito place that give -PRON- ground beef -PRON- get chunk and chunk of real steak here
-PRON- be good but -PRON- be not mind blow good
decide to give this place another try today
-PRON- order the halibut burrito omg
-PRON- blow -PRON- mind
the fish be crunchy and flaky
the ingredient be so fresh and the xxxtra hot sauce be awesome
-PRON- would definitely come back for more
excellent food and service
the girl work in the front be very nice
-PRON- family and -PRON- will be return
-PRON- come here twice in the same week
n the staff be very friendly n knowledgeable when -PRON- ask for suggestion
-PRON- order 3 different taco the americano one be -PRON- favorite but the other two be also very good
the price be very reasonable too
so -PRON- will come back again for the great food great pricing and friendly staff
by the way tho make sure u go to the back of the restaurant and grab urself a bunch of sauce to try on ur food bc that be where -PRON- hide all the all -PRON- can get sauce even for togo
how can -PRON- not give this luxurious beautiful hotel 5 start
as soon as -PRON- walk in -PRON- look like -PRON- be in italy with the beautiful ceiling painting marble decor
-PRON- be very much into architecture and design
this place be outstanding -PRON- get an a + from -PRON-
all -PRON- have to say be that the pizza be not even that good and wtf be the deal with this mt lebanon 2.5 charge for topping
$ 6 + for some topping on an 8 pizza
and service be so so so slow
overrated
china grill be great for happy hour but -PRON- can imagine -PRON- be somewhere -PRON- would like late night
-PRON- be dark and sexy with plenty of room to lounge great drink and a thievery corporation base playlist
-PRON- really really want a place like this in dc
-PRON- will never ever get -PRON-
but onto food and drink whatev -PRON- drink be strong
and tasty
-PRON- have three of -PRON-
and -PRON- be way more than tipsy
kelly enjoy -PRON- appetizer but -PRON- do not like anything on the appetizer list
-PRON- try order an option from -PRON- and be just not a fan
however go for the atmosphere and the drink
no a\/c or fan in -PRON- 10th floor dormitory -PRON- be cover in sweat almost immediately and have a very uncomfortable night sleep
some people may be alright with that
but -PRON- would definitely not recommend -PRON- to anybody
nice people at the front desk but overall bad vibe throughout the building
would not come back
a little conflicted with how to rate this review
compare to other fine dining place -PRON- have be to e.g. guy savoy roubouchon latalier alex le cirque etc
-PRON- think the food be a 3.5
-PRON- just seem to be try too hard to do something really over the top and unique
however the experience in the private room with the over the top service be really great and what make this meal and make the experience a 4 or 4.5
at this price point there be good option
but if -PRON- want an over the top service experience send -PRON- an email for a re the only way to get one
go for brunch which be expensive yet bland and ordinary
lamb surprisingly good
pass on any fish course-
-PRON- be tasteless
mozzarella cheese not fresh
service need overhaul do not know menu quote inaccurate price then try to get full price for the misquote drinks\/fare despite the fact that decision be take on -PRON- bad information
after argument agree to take the drinks\/fare off the bill then proceed to take the half consume item away what a waste
service also have nagging habit of bussing table before the diner be finish with -PRON- course
decor be dank and cheerless
for the price -PRON- charge valentino be a disappointment
go there now
that be all
-PRON- be not a big fan of height
so the last time -PRON- stay at the strat -PRON- want to make -PRON- go up hight
-PRON- do not quiet have the gut to do one of the ride that fling -PRON- out over the side but this one seem okay
-PRON- make -PRON- take -PRON- shoe off
and -PRON- have to take -PRON- glass off which make -PRON- a little harder for -PRON- to appreciate the view
but wow what a rush
-PRON- have to try -PRON-
gluten free doughnut that be still a favorite in -PRON- book
-PRON- really need to stop by more often-
but -PRON- be here 4 5 time and always satisfied with -PRON- purchase of gf goody
-PRON- have have a few visit to this property over the year under both the current and previous owner and base on what -PRON- have see -PRON- have not really change much with the exception of maybe remove the mcdonald 's inside and rebrand with a new name
-PRON- recall -PRON- be one of the first property -PRON- visit on -PRON- first trip to vegas a decade ago so -PRON- will always be fond of -PRON-
the buffet be excellent and the mainstream restaurant kick out the big slab of prime rib -PRON- think -PRON- have ever have
the little convenient store in the middle of the casino be always good about let -PRON- pay for merchandise with comp points\/dollar
there always seem to be a huge selection of beer available for -PRON- be a convenient store
-PRON- have a one night stay in one of the standard room in the original tower ground floor
-PRON- seem to be a step up from a super 8 or maybe an econo lodge but nothing too extravagant
-PRON- stay be comp but -PRON- have see very good pricing here if -PRON- be pay for room
-PRON- have hear that the new tower and the jacuzzi suite be a bit nice
the check in desk area be a bit convoluted as -PRON- seem to be right smack dab in a corner of the mainstream casino floor
usually good to leave -PRON- bag in the car until after check in to avoid the madness
there have always be a good amount of local patron in the casino many with interesting story to tell
definitely worth consider if -PRON- be look to stay near the strip without pay high price -PRON- be within walking distance and -PRON- be directly across the street from the hard rock
-PRON- be a group of 10 on a quintuple date and the guy pretty much make the call to order all the tapas on 2 page of the menu plus a paella or two
give that the portion size of tapas be in reverse proportion to the quantity of food that these man can ingest the lady help out too of course order two page plus of the menu be not as overwhelming as one may think
-PRON- have an awesome time enjoy each other company and -PRON- server be very attentive
however the final bill really be not a good reflection on the overall gastronomic and atmospheric experience
this place be too expensive for the quality of the experience
have try most of the protein infuse tapas -PRON- can say that most item be either too plain uninspired overcook or overpower with not enough or inappropriate accompaniment
-PRON- really enjoy the cod and the liver pate
the various shrimp dish be uninspired
in one the butter sauce be tasty but the shrimp seem overcook
the chorizo be um chorizo and the chicken be literally lump of chicken
-PRON- have the classic paella and though the rice be tasty the mussel chicken and chorizo be not of the good quality
-PRON- also have various beer that be tasty and the white wine sangria that -PRON- would highly recommend
the flamenco dancing gimmick last for what seem like the blink of an eye
-PRON- be there for quite a while and too busy enjoy chat with each other to notice too much though
overall this be probably a place that -PRON- may want to try once
parking be either on the street or in a green p.
-PRON- hear there be free parking after 6 p.m. on broadview
horrible service incompetent management that -PRON- do not leave information on issue and expect other management to clean -PRON- mistake
do not do pickup order at this store
great service great food and an amazing view
-PRON- do not usually think the extra cost to eat at high end restaurant for the ambiance be worth -PRON- probably because -PRON- be not rollin in dough either
lol but this place be an exception
right when -PRON- walk in -PRON- be warmly greet by staff and in awe of the decor
the view be as good as -PRON- get in vegas and the service here be very attentive and professional
the food be delicious
-PRON- would highly recommend the bison t bone
this be a great place to celebrate an anniversary valentines day bday etc
if -PRON- bring a date here expect -PRON- to put out after
lol
this doctor 's office be absolutely ridiculous
-PRON- be not professional
front desk receptionist be extremely rude
with an appointment -PRON- wait 2 hour
dr. vogel will come in an not apologize -PRON- just complain
-PRON- be very spacey
-PRON- will ramble about -PRON- catholic belief article -PRON- read in cosmo that pertain to -PRON-
-PRON- be not ready to diagnose yet -PRON- want to get to know -PRON-
beware -PRON- be a quack doctor
this office not only make -PRON- wait for 2hours -PRON- meet with the doctor and leave wonder what just happen -PRON- will never get those three waste hour back
-PRON- have work for hospital bill dept
this doctor charge an absurd amount for unsolicited religious bias and memorable cosmo article
-PRON- pay -PRON- co pay at -PRON- visit only to receive a collection bill in the mail request -PRON- co pay again
if this be a referral ask for someone else
-PRON- have extremely thick hair and have always have trouble find someone who know how to deal with -PRON-
-PRON- brother have be go to sergio for a little while now and recommend -PRON- try -PRON- out as well
-PRON- have to say -PRON- be extremely impressed
-PRON- do everything with a straight blade no scissor at all that -PRON- remember and make sure -PRON- like where thing be go frequently along the way -PRON- especially like that -PRON- do that because if -PRON- be like -PRON- -PRON- will just sit in the chair and watch -PRON- beautiful head of hair be shape into disaster and not say a word unless ask
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- want something fashionable but not trendy
-PRON- be not sure if that would make sense
but -PRON- guess -PRON- do to -PRON- because -PRON- get exactly what -PRON- want
and -PRON- walk out feel more confident than after most any other haircut -PRON- have have
-PRON- serve at a restaurant uptown and have be get copious amount of comment on -PRON- hair since go to -PRON-
people tell -PRON- -PRON- look like patrick dempsey now
haha
nothing wrong with that in -PRON- book
thank sergio
amazing food at a great price
not to mention the gentleman -PRON- think -PRON- be the owner
work behind the cash register be very warm welcome and overall a really cool guy
-PRON- ask what -PRON- should get and -PRON- say catfish sell the most for -PRON- here
so -PRON- have to get the catfish
-PRON- be a 3pc meal that come with 2 side and corn bread $ 8.99
for -PRON- side -PRON- get mac n cheese and cajun fry
the catfish be unreal -PRON- have authentic southern taste
very light and batter just right season with cajun spice
of course -PRON- still add hot sauce which make -PRON- the perfect southern dish
the side be pretty good too -PRON- compliment the catfish really well
but -PRON- be not overpower in taste or weight
but the corn bread be amazing
outstandingly fluffy and sweet in flavor
the sweetness contest the spice of the catfish and fry perfectly
all in all a very well price meal with a legitimate hospitable service
would go out of -PRON- way to come here again and try some more food
quick and amazing service
-PRON- always treat -PRON- so well here
-PRON- would recommend go to discount
first time here
-PRON- sis want to check -PRON- out since -PRON- like the music -PRON- be hear
-PRON- have hip hop music blare from the roof deck and a downstairs area play melancholy music
free entrance for the lady and charge 5.00 for the man
be prepared to wait in a line just to get upstairs though
-PRON- hear a few people say to pay the guy man the stair $ 10pp just so -PRON- can let -PRON- in without waiting, wtf
no thank get -PRON- a drink with that
the plus side be there be a lot of seat downstairs
you'll need -PRON- because the music will definitely put -PRON- to sleep
anyhow upstairs small small small place
forget to mention too that if -PRON- wait to get upstairs and now find -PRON- need the restroom -PRON- can find -PRON- back in that line to get upstairs because the only accessible bathroom be downstairs
be not that a bia
drink be about $ 10 but -PRON- go to spend a pricey amount if -PRON- want to get -PRON- buzz on because -PRON- do not think -PRON- even add alcohol
-PRON- order -PRON- drink and all -PRON- be be juice
what a shame
-PRON- be one of the place -PRON- could say
be there do that be not go back
there be many more place in downtown to go
-PRON- be in town for the wsop seniors tournament and pick the gold coast as a place to stay as close to the rio as possible
overall -PRON- be happy with -PRON- stay here
pros 1 spacious well ventilate casino 2
great food tgi friday 's for cheap breakfast asian noodle bar with the good authentic noodle and rice dish handy subway for a quick sandwich any time of day 3
quick check in and out 4
advantage car rental desk at the front of the casino with car on site
5
great newly refurbish room with modern decor and flat screen tv 6 abundant security on duty who ask to see -PRON- room card before -PRON- go up in the elevator in the evening and at night con
1 super slow bar service in the casino and at tgi fridays
the bartender in the casino be more concerned with fill the casino floor waitress tray with drink than serve customer at the bar
no eye contact
nothing
-PRON- do not even acknowledge -PRON- presence
same issue next door at the rio
when -PRON- go to -PRON- room and call the manager on duty at fridays to complain -PRON- get a couple of heinekens deliver to -PRON- room for free
2
the casino charge for trivial thing such as wi fi or a refrigerator for -PRON- room
overall -PRON- be pleased with the gold coast and would stay there again
the bar issue piss -PRON- off because -PRON- would just spend the afternoon at hoover dam in 107 degree heat and be really look forward to a couple of cold beer
the bulk spice section be pretty much the good thing that have happen to -PRON- all year
-PRON- have everything -PRON- have ever need and for a fraction of the price of the one that come in shaker
this be amazing for someone who like to try new recipe

nice addition to the neighborhood
not five star because kitchen floor be a bit dirty
buy a live social deal and mark go over everything with -PRON- ahead of time on the phone
so there would be no surprise about any miss fine print etc
-PRON- stick -PRON- as fair honest and eager to help -PRON- get the most bang for -PRON- buck
-PRON- be more than prompt on appointment day call -PRON- ahead of schedule to see if -PRON- be available and head over
-PRON- spruce up floor tile in the laundry room and three bathroom and clean two area rug one of which contain lots of evidence of foot people foot + paw traffic and a couple of spill
give -PRON- tip on diy cleaning and stain treatment to keep thing as spiffy as possible until -PRON- have -PRON- out again and -PRON- will have -PRON- out again
when -PRON- say see -PRON- in a year -PRON- say -PRON- be good for close to two year
and -PRON- grand total include the living social be $ 155 the total -PRON- be quote over the phone by other before -PRON- purchase the living social deal and speak to mark for just one area rug
so 4 room with tile floor + two area rug a 5x7 and an 8x10 + solid diy tip for maintenance + promptness + courteousness + spotless cleanup job = very happy and definitely repeat customer
thank -PRON- mark
-PRON- recently vacation in costa rica and have leftover money to change back into canadian dollar
-PRON- be also prepare for a trip to thailand and indonesia and convert money
-PRON- be very helpful and -PRON- find the fee to be minimal compare to other place
-PRON- have stay at the venetian many time but the last time have change -PRON- mind about this hotel
although lovely and a great location -PRON- room be not clean when -PRON- check in
by not clean -PRON- mean cut toenail on the desk yuck
and event the next day not clean again
-PRON- answer -PRON- survey with detail on the circumstance and yet no one contact -PRON- about the stay
interesting
but for the cost -PRON- will most likely try another close hotel from now on
disappointing to say the least that -PRON- do not even contact -PRON- for follow up
-PRON- have order many cake from decadent designs and have not have a bad experience or cake yet
today 's cake be for -PRON- daughter 2nd birthday
-PRON- can not bring -PRON- to feed -PRON- sweet child and -PRON- friend
a dye infuse screenprint cake from wal mart
so -PRON- spend the extra coin for an artisan cake if -PRON- will
since -PRON- be 2 and -PRON- sometimes feel like -PRON- love dora the explorer more than life -PRON- -PRON- go with a dora cake
-PRON- be perfect
european butter cream on the outside hazelnut cream inside and vanilla cake be perfect
-PRON- be just sweet enough the cake -PRON- be light and fluffy and both frosting inside and out be a hit
the design on the top be a perfect replication of dora and -PRON- daughter smile from ear to ear when -PRON- see -PRON-
the designer be spot on and everything be perfect
the new shop in conlan circle be very spacious and well plan out
-PRON- add coffee ice cream and gelato so hopefully that add to -PRON- business
locally own great business
-PRON- will be back
-PRON- have be here twice in three week
give that -PRON- be a 25-minute drive and that -PRON- rarely repeat at all even when a place be nearby that be high praise to begin with
while the hot dish be terrific and help create a more balanced meal the raw bar dish and special be the star
the scallop and the surf clam be perfectly fresh rotate special and the amberjack crudo have accompaniment to good take advantage of the fish 's unique taste and texture
both bartenders\/mixologist -PRON- have meet be knowledgeable and -PRON- be almost as pleased with the dealer 's choice both during the meal and as after dinner as at a place like herbs and rye
also best dollar oyster we've had in vegas
blue point with interesting garnish rosemary mignonette wasabi horseradish
-PRON- will be back as soon as possible
the good pho and bun in town
-PRON- have try many vietnamese restaurant and every time -PRON- eat anywhere else -PRON- always think this be not as good as lemongrass
base off of other review -PRON- guess -PRON- depend on when -PRON- go what kind of service -PRON- will get
-PRON- have never have -PRON- pizza -PRON- never look appetizing when -PRON- walk in and see -PRON- sit on the counter
-PRON- be crave garlic bread and this place have good review on -PRON- garlic knot
so -PRON- get some
-PRON- be incredible
well the first time -PRON- have -PRON- -PRON- be
the second time when -PRON- would bite into one grease go every where
like -PRON- be a grease bomb
still good but that much greasy oily ness be a deterrent
so that be a couple month ago and -PRON- be in the mood for spaghetti recently
the young woman at the front counter seem nice enough but -PRON- definitely be be obviously fake and could care less what -PRON- have to say just place -PRON- order if -PRON- must and get out of -PRON- face
-PRON- would not hold -PRON- against -PRON- -PRON- all have bad day when -PRON- try hard to be nice
but -PRON- do not always come across well
when -PRON- ask for spaghetti with meatball -PRON- be give the option of three different pasta which be awesome
but -PRON- go with regular and meat sauce instead of meatball
apparently -PRON- be order the dinner special or something because -PRON- come with a salad and garlic knot which -PRON- be go to order anyway because hopefully -PRON- would be good this time
-PRON- request a caesar salad because that be the safe bet that people do not go crazy like -PRON- would a house salad
when -PRON- go to find a seat while -PRON- wait the first table be still dirty from whatev patron have eat there so -PRON- move on
the next table seem relatively clean but come to find out after -PRON- sit that the top be completely sticky like -PRON- have use a dirty rag in dirty water to wipe the table off
time go by and eventually -PRON- food be ready
-PRON- open the bag to check for utensil and napkin since -PRON- usually forget to look and do not want to ask if -PRON- already provide -PRON-
-PRON- do not see any
and when -PRON- look up to ask the man -PRON- assume be the manager be give -PRON- a look that make -PRON- so nervous -PRON- ask for parmesan packet instead of utensil
the look from the young woman be more of a why be -PRON- still waste -PRON- time just leave
so i ask for one and leave as fast as possible
when -PRON- arrive home -PRON- pull out a small styrofoam container and a large aluminum container
-PRON- think -PRON- have forget -PRON- garlic knot
and -PRON- be sad because that be the part -PRON- be look forward to the most
unfortunately -PRON- have stick -PRON- in with the spaghetti
most people would not find this a problem unless -PRON- do not like soggy bread
-PRON- do not like soggy bread
and -PRON- also do not like sauce on garlic bread in any state
-PRON- be not -PRON- fault
-PRON- do not know
and -PRON- be sure -PRON- be just try to save money on container
so -PRON- move on to the salad
-PRON- have never have a caesar salad that have black olive in -PRON-
and -PRON- be litter with -PRON-
-PRON- be a pizza place
-PRON- should have enough topping to make an accurate caesar salad
-PRON- end up toss -PRON- out
-PRON- then move onto the garlic knot even though cover in sauce maybe -PRON- could save the meal
-PRON- be so wrong
both knot -PRON- have receive be completely burn on the bottom and that be all -PRON- taste like even with the add sauce on -PRON-
ok well maybe the spaghetti can save this meal since that be what -PRON- be initially in the mood for anyway
-PRON- have have more flavorful spaghetti from a freezer section
the noodle be the only good part of the entire meal
will -PRON- go back
only one more time for those garlic knot
if -PRON- be bad again -PRON- will never return and take -PRON- business down the road to casanova bros where -PRON- seem legitimately nice even when -PRON- be busy and treat -PRON- like an old friend of the family
the drink be alive dessert be tempting sandwich be good
-PRON- really like that be 24\/7 but wi fi be limitedly free
-PRON- be a cool place to chill be in jean and work etc
one stall for the woman 's rr but oh well
owner be cool staff too
2b continue

the last two selection be what -PRON- friend and -PRON- have
the shrimp be excellent
-PRON- be perfectly cook on crispy toast bread cover with pesto
there be also piece of sweet pineapple slice cherry tomato and chop onion to add some more color and tropical flavor
there be a massive amount of shrimp on the plate which make this dish a tasty and very good deal
-PRON- friend have the brie with fennel and puff pastry -PRON- description of this by the way do not do the dish justice
all the ingredient be well prepared and very good on -PRON- own but for -PRON- -PRON- be not as good as -PRON- shrimp dish

the hibiscus tea be very refreshing with a deep garnet color to the drink
-PRON- total for 2 lunch dish and 1 ice tea be a little over $ 30 include tax

-PRON- get sit in the main dining room and about 10 minute later a pompous assistant manager come and say -PRON- have to move -PRON- becasue the hostess sit -PRON- in a reserved table the place be pretty dead
-PRON- get sit in the bar area and the air condition be on full blast make -PRON- freeze cold

-PRON- have 6 differnet taco 3 be really good and three be horrible
the least -PRON- could do if -PRON- move a group once -PRON- have be seat be apologize maybe offer to buy -PRON- a drink and make sure the rest of -PRON- dining experience be enjoyable
-PRON- have a feeling that there will be another restaurant in -PRON- be place soon if -PRON- do not get -PRON- act together

nice break from gambling and drinking
-PRON- can see why jk end up write 7 book
-PRON- be probably up to the final draft of deathly hallows before -PRON- get serve

seven of -PRON- walk in want something hot
-PRON- take at good half an hour before all seven of -PRON- have out drink and be sit down to drink -PRON-
the service be so abysmally s l o w
so many staff member but -PRON- order be take and make one by one by the same gentleman while the rest of -PRON- just stand there
hot chocolate be pretty overpriced but still hit the spot
wow what a wonderful find
the service be traditionally excellent with a touch of warmth which be a delight to experience
the signature roll -PRON- order cater to -PRON- up scale taste and deliver a great dining experience
do not hesitate to join the new venue
highly recommend
locate inside yonge\/eglinton centre this be the only place to satisfy -PRON- ice cream craving in the area
-PRON- be around $ 3.99 for a scoop and just 99 cent extra for the second scoop
-PRON- also place a complimentary piece of chocolate on top
-PRON- have around 3 flavour that be gluten free so those who be allergic to gluten have a few choice to pick from
-PRON- favourite be the pistachio flavor there be actual piece of pistachio in the ice cream
the french mint be also delicious
price be good unfortunately -PRON- make up for the cheap price of the flight with fee for everything
$ 5 just to print -PRON- boarding pass at the airport not to mention the carry on and check bag fee that be a bit too steep
also -PRON- flight leave two hour late and -PRON- be never give a reason for -PRON- be late departure
-PRON- have have hair extension for 8 year 's have try every kind and brand
-PRON- be a bit fanatic about -PRON- hair
-PRON- be so happy -PRON- find viva salon and especially racquel
-PRON- be refer by -PRON- friend who be a hair fanatic too
and -PRON- insist -PRON- go
-PRON- should do a review too but people tend to only write review when -PRON- want to vent
not -PRON-
-PRON- be so happy
-PRON- be inspire to write a review
and -PRON- never do this
so glad -PRON- friend convince -PRON- to go to racquel
-PRON- walk in and be greet with a big smile and a warm welcome
the salon be clean and stylish -PRON- sit down and be offer a beverage -PRON- get a water but find out -PRON- have a keurig
lol sometimes -PRON- be the little thing
then when -PRON- get -PRON- hair do racquel be able to put a weft in and individual extension sometimes stylist only do one kind boo
-PRON- love -PRON- knowledge versatility and experience
-PRON- do not know everything -PRON- do
but damn everyone even strait man be compliment -PRON- hair all week long
-PRON- must be some master cutter
then -PRON- convince -PRON- to do the hombre highlight like the victoria secret model and -PRON- love that too
so as a person who obsess over -PRON- hair and have try everyone and every salon with over 15 year live in vegas trust -PRON- and go to viva salon and ask for racquel
the owner be simply put an asshole
-PRON- be a middle aged asian male who make customer feel very uncomfortable
as soon as -PRON- walk into the coffee shop -PRON- better buy something or -PRON- be go to come to -PRON- table and either ask -PRON- to leave or -PRON- personal favorite be -PRON- wait for a friend -PRON- have a harsh tone to -PRON- voice to go with a fake smile to let -PRON- know to pay up or leave
-PRON- be all in favor of support small business but the lack of foresight and narrow mind of this owner have officially make -PRON- never want to come here again
-PRON- be a dam shame because -PRON- actually like the ambience there
amazing atmosphere very friendly service over all great
mike the bar tender super great service
this be a great factory store
the staff be great and the selection be unbelievable
-PRON- do not get to cleveland often but -PRON- will be back at this store again and again
-PRON- go to granite city today for -PRON- sunday brunch
-PRON- usually go twice a month
the brunch be very tasty and have a lot of variety
today -PRON- have a bad experience
-PRON- show up at 10:30 a.m. and ask for a table of one
the hostess say -PRON- be very busy and that -PRON- need to sit at the bar
-PRON- tell -PRON- that -PRON- need to sit at a table
-PRON- say -PRON- do not have anything available
-PRON- initially walk out the door but then -PRON- come back and say that i would sit at the bar
when -PRON- go to the buffet line -PRON- notice that -PRON- have 10 empty spot include 6 table
every guest enter the restaurant behind -PRON- be seat include two table
during the time that -PRON- be there every guest come into the door be seat at either a table or booth
-PRON- tell the bartender about -PRON- experience
-PRON- be go to tell the manager
-PRON- also say that -PRON- speak to the hostess
the hostess claim there be no server available to wait on someone at a table
the hostess lie because every guest enter the restaurant be allow to sit at a table or a booth
as a disabled person with a muscle movement disability -PRON- be disappointed with the way that -PRON- be treat
-PRON- do not think ask to sit at a table be too much to ask a restaurant
-PRON- would have wait for a table but -PRON- do not even offer -PRON-
-PRON- love el pollo loco but this be the first one -PRON- have ever be unhappy with
-PRON- go in pretty early in the day
-PRON- be not sure if the chicken be not prepare like normal or if -PRON- be yesterday 's
the skin be so tough when normally that be what make -PRON- so delicious
the reason -PRON- be get one star though be because this store obviously have a sewer problem
walk up to the store -PRON- smell great
inside be another story
at first -PRON- think -PRON- must just be because -PRON- have the bathroom door open for clean
but eat in the dining area -PRON- be still an overwhelming smell
-PRON- be strong by the soda machine where only water and soda be go in the drain
so definitely do not eat in
-PRON- really ruin the food
but -PRON- would not return for drive through either since -PRON- be trademark chicken be a let down
there be always a silver lining so -PRON- will say that the staff be nice friendly and fast
poutine be a french canadian dish of french fry and fresh cheese curd cover with brown gravy or sauce
ugggh -PRON- think -PRON- just gain 5 pound write that
but of course -PRON- can not come to montreal and not have any
so -PRON- end up at frite alors
this be -PRON- first poutine experience
so -PRON- be go to go with three star
-PRON- order the traditional which be just cheese and gravy
the cheese be not melt -PRON- come in a curd form see pic
-PRON- be good but obviously very filling great for share and great for after hour
-PRON- favorite part be the gravy
oh -PRON- lawd so good
the cheese be just ok
-PRON- do not really do much for -PRON- in the curd form
first review in almost 5 month
use to go here alot
-PRON- even know the face of the serf
and -PRON- know -PRON- by name
the thing about this place after not come here for so many month be that -PRON- have a hug renovation
go be the old decor and the old table and chair
the new style and atmosphere be 10 time good than the old one but to -PRON- dismay the food go from 4 star to 2 almost 1 star
here be the 4 main reason -PRON- put -PRON- to 2 star
1
-PRON- favorite pot roast be smother by gravy
-PRON- be cover with gravy
-PRON- can not even see anything in -PRON- plate just dark brown gravy
2
food be too salty
this be not an issue before yes maybe -PRON- lean more in the salty side but not this salty
-PRON- could swear to god -PRON- bread be as salty as -PRON- gravy
3
so after -PRON- dismay -PRON- tell -PRON- maybe -PRON- be just one of those day u know
but even in the dessert department -PRON- get -PRON- upset
first order a milkshake
maybe -PRON- be just -PRON- but -PRON- do not taste like -PRON- use to
-PRON- do not have that smoothness
and -PRON- be too chocolatey
almost like someone just pour a bucket of chocolate powder in a bucket and share -PRON-
oh and -PRON- forget to ask if -PRON- want whip or not and put whip on it-_- 4
okay after that -PRON- taste -PRON- use to be pancake
and say of course -PRON- can not mess this up
well the pancake be so stale and be not smooth at all
-PRON- know that feeling of like eat a either cold or old food
that be what -PRON- feel when -PRON- start eat that pancake
p.s -PRON- will still give -PRON- another try
-PRON- honestly can not go wrong with anything here
just try the pulled rotisserie chicken sandwich and -PRON- an absolute game changer
-PRON- have have the bbq plate -PRON- first time at city smoke of course
because if -PRON- claim to be a bbq restaurant -PRON- have to be on point
-PRON- love -PRON- and the mac
n cheese be a must
go to guys for lunch and breakfast
have the mac and cheese burger and for breakfast have breakfast burrito
every thing be amazing
would highly recommend -PRON-
go to the concierge at linq and -PRON- can give -PRON- a 20 off coupon during business day
this have be the good hotel -PRON- have stay at
-PRON- celebrate -PRON- anniversary here for 5 night 6 day and have a really awesome experience
upon check in -PRON- be upgrade to a penthouse balcony suite free of charge
-PRON- appreciate have the doubledoor entry to -PRON- suite
feel important lol
anyhoo -PRON- be a germaphobe and take -PRON- own cleaning product with -PRON- wherever -PRON- stay
and -PRON- must say the room be very clean
no issue whatsoever
the bathroom be -PRON- favorite part
finally a tub and shower that can accommodate all -PRON- sexy fluffiness
;-d
love the appliance in the kitchenette -PRON- have everything -PRON- would need
the recess lighting be a nice touch along with the light in the entryway that shin into the vase
the bed be comfortable as well
-PRON- love the look and feel of the suite the lobby in the 3 tower and the exterior
the staff be helpful and pleasant
-PRON- do not mind the location because -PRON- do not want to be on the strip plus the staff hail taxi in no time
can not wait to return
-PRON- wife and go to the show with another couple on a friday night
-PRON- be the second time -PRON- have see the show the first be about a year ago
-PRON- thoroughly enjoy the show both time
as many other review state -PRON- be a high energy show with never a dull moment
even the break between routine be fun and entertain with singer gabriella
all of the performer be beautiful charming athletic sexy and accomplished dancer
jennifer have produce another excellent and highly entertaining show
-PRON- think -PRON- be the good topless show in vegas and highly recommend -PRON-
bring both of -PRON- car there a few time and always have receive good service
-PRON- just recently have -PRON- taillight replace
also a great place to get -PRON- oil change and -PRON- would definitely recommend -PRON-
-PRON- can go either way on factory direct either -PRON- can really luck out and get an amazing deal or wind up in jail on multiple homicide charge for kill all the staff
so -PRON- be a mixed bag
-PRON- generally watch the flyer for deal on refurbish stuff
-PRON- have pick up three harmony remote at least 50 off for -PRON- and friend over the year in addition to countless other thing
if -PRON- do this and know what -PRON- be look for -PRON- can make off like a bandit
actually get the stuff be frustrating as hell
there be never enough staff and everything worth buying be behind the counter be in identical look white box
watch out for stuff in original packaging
no matter how beat up or use -PRON- look -PRON- seem all that stuff be new
once -PRON- get -PRON- stuff run do not walk home to test -PRON-
most stuff -PRON- have get a whopping 10 day for exchange no refund and maybe a 30 day warranty
so -PRON- be a good idea to find out that -PRON- remote have a defective lcd before -PRON- run out
which -PRON- will
so overall -PRON- can find some amazing deal so long as -PRON- know
both what -PRON- be look for and what -PRON- be get into
because know be half the battle
very tasting wing -PRON- prefer -PRON- to the tender because to -PRON- the wing have more flavor
-PRON- also like that the wing be bread then fry so -PRON- be extra crunchy
-PRON- recommend avoid go in within 30 minute or even an hour of closing
-PRON- get there a little after 7 get -PRON- food after 7:30 and be still chow down around 8
the guy work there though be put the chair up the second customer leave the table
-PRON- understand there be a lot of prep work and clean -PRON- have to do after close but -PRON- make -PRON- feel like -PRON- need to hurry up and get out of there
-PRON- also do not create a very welcoming atmosphere for customer who be come in to eat
to be honest -PRON- have only have one other facial in -PRON- life
and -PRON- be hesitant to even try just anywhere to get a facial especially since -PRON- have always struggle with a bit of acne
after read some of renu 's 5-star review -PRON- decide to book an appointment
well as -PRON- may notice from -PRON- 5-star review -PRON- be very pleased with how -PRON- go and -PRON- only do a basic
renu be a very sweet lady and do an amazing job
-PRON- especially enjoy the face and neck massage
-PRON- feel very relaxed afterward and leave know -PRON- would return soon
price be very reasonable as well which be another reason -PRON- will be go much more often for facial
-PRON- can not wait to try something other than the basic facial
foody mart at bamburgh circle can be a nightmarish experience to shop here
parking always a problem since there be few restaurant in the same plaza
-PRON- find foody mart do have good pricing than t&t but be not as clean and organize but worth come if -PRON- can stand the parking situation and the crowd
opening till 12 am everyday -PRON- would come after 9 pm when -PRON- be not as busy
-PRON- accept visa mastercard and interac
trader joe be -PRON- boyfriend
do not tell -PRON- other boyfriend
-PRON- start out as a small harmless affair but now -PRON- visit tj a few time a week come home from work late
-PRON- boyfriend do not even need to ask where have -PRON- be
the paper bag in -PRON- hand bulge with deliciousness give -PRON- away every time
-PRON- see no reason why people hate on trader joe 's
-PRON- mean waaah less selection than a real grocery store
duh people
this be not a giant eagle thank god
this be not to mean to have every single thing ever
but nearly every single thing -PRON- do have be incredible delicious well price and make from natural ingredient
-PRON- do as much of -PRON- shopping here as possible and if -PRON- really look -PRON- can find almost anything -PRON- need
-PRON- have hardly have something here
-PRON- do not love
holy crap where do -PRON- begin
mango sorbet -PRON- holiday peppermint\/cookie and cream ice cream plantain chip peanut butter fill pretzel inexpensive dry fruit\/nut way cheap than any other store totally affordable gourmet cheese joe 's os 99 cent pasta amazing frozen entree strawberry licorice cheap produce yes small selection but -PRON- be inexpensive so -PRON- all work out
surprisingly good meat selection ginger beer raspberry fruit spread great price on staple diced tomato coconut milk flour sugar flavorful pasta sauce tasty tea jasmine green be -PRON- favorite and a million other delicious thing
-PRON- want to eat the whole store
except the pet food
-PRON- be tragic that pa 's idiotic liquor law do not allow this tjs to sell wine and beer
-PRON- do not know what -PRON- be miss
the wine section at -PRON- old tj 's in chicago be the absolute bomb
bottle under $ 10 as far as the eye can see
if pa get -PRON- be act together this trader joe 's could achieve an even high level of perfection
the line be not even that long
seriously people go to a tj 's in a big city like chicago
that be a bad line
this store move pretty swiftly
employee be friendly dare -PRON- say perky and always helpful
maybe because tj 's pay -PRON- a very high wage relative to other grocery store employee and provide benefit
-PRON- be a great business to support
tj 's forever -PRON- will always love -PRON-
no other store can compare
come in the morning of the mlk holiday
-PRON- check in and sit outside wait for -PRON- table only to have the server come out call -PRON- name and then tell -PRON- oh there be a lot of group ahead of -PRON-
lol
then after be seat -PRON- say that -PRON- run out of kid menus and out of that drink
-PRON- have to get up out of -PRON- seat to get -PRON- own menu
seriously
-PRON- have yet to get -PRON- food but the experience so far be make -PRON- group question if -PRON- will ever come back
as of now -PRON- answer be no
-PRON- have be to cityview on 3 occasion for clean and have no issue with the hygienists the 3 different girl -PRON- have all do a great job
on -PRON- last visit just a couple day ago -PRON- be tell -PRON- be have a complete exam which be fine by -PRON- as -PRON- have 100 coverage with -PRON- benefit through work
during the exam dr. liu proceed to poke -PRON- in the gum above -PRON- 2 front tooth which be very painful -PRON- response to the pain be that -PRON- have plaque under -PRON- gum due to -PRON- 2 crowns not fit properly and that -PRON- should have -PRON- replace
-PRON- find this odd as -PRON- have never have an issue with -PRON- crown in the past and the only time -PRON- experience pain be when -PRON- be poke -PRON- with -PRON- instrument
clearly this be an attempt to try and up sell -PRON- on new crown that do not need to be replace so -PRON- could bill -PRON- insurance company for more work do
upon leave -PRON- appointment -PRON- be tell -PRON- owe $ 236 for work that have be do and that be not cover by -PRON- insurance company -PRON- find this odd as -PRON- have 100 coverage and have never in 17 year pay one penny at -PRON- last dentist
clearly -PRON- be do work that s not necessary without check with the insurance company or -PRON- before proceed
after some choice word with dr. liu -PRON- wave the charge for the cost of work not cover
but -PRON- still find the whole experience with -PRON- very unprofessional and quite frankly a little dodgy
-PRON- personally would never go back to this clinic which be a shame as -PRON- right under -PRON- condo and -PRON- would never recommend any treatment
what so ever by dr. liu
if -PRON- be just look to have have -PRON- tooth clean -PRON- fine but do -PRON- homework with -PRON- insurance coverage before make an appointment because the girl at the front desk will not tell -PRON- what work be go to be do and what be cover
-PRON- have never be to spago before only hear about the legendary spago in la that start the gourmet pizza revolution
-PRON- have be to a few wolfgang puck express location and -PRON- never remember a bad experience
so -PRON- can say this be -PRON- first fine dining excursion by the celebrity chef
-PRON- will skip right to the food
the complimentary amuse bouche of potato and cauliflower soup in a teeny cup be a nice touch to start thing off
the selection of complimentary bread be great -PRON- provide some olive oil salt and pepper for dip too
grilled octopus salad 4 star chunk of octopus be incredibly tender
the little bit of citrus from the preserved lemon really bring out the flavor
the white bean ragout provide a nice starchy contrast to the protein of the octopus
new england diver sea scallop 3 star three big sized scallop that be all nicely cook
-PRON- be top with a foam that barely have any flavor
on the menu -PRON- say -PRON- be a white corn mascarpone emulsion and basil oil
the downer for this dish -PRON- wife eat the last scallop and -PRON- have a really awful tasting char aftertaste
-PRON- be probably from the burn part of the pan or from reuse a dirty pan instead of a clean one
-PRON- palette be destroy after that one
red wine braise short rib 3 star nice presentation with all of the ingredient put together
the short rib be tender melt in -PRON- mouth and full of flavor
overall -PRON- think the flavor be a bit monotone
plus -PRON- desperately need some crunchy texture in the dish
between the ricotta gnocchi and the meat -PRON- be sort of like eat baby food just really expensive baby food
service be slow and indifferent throughout the night
-PRON- be apparent that -PRON- do not place a high priority on service
for the amount of money -PRON- charge here that be unacceptable
-PRON- tell -PRON- about the bad scallop and the manager be nice enough to take the entire scallop entree off the bill
that be almost $ 40
-PRON- do earn brownie point for that but overall -PRON- do not see -PRON- return with so many other vegas restaurant on the bookmark list
so fun and yet quite different from the original vig surrondings-
-PRON- can not help but love the fact that the bar staff have a shake weight behind the bar
the white board wall be a total hoot by the end of the night anything from robot birthday shout out and a overly clever dog with a monocle
food-
if -PRON- do not have the deconstructed fish taco -PRON- be not live
-PRON- be not a fish taco or taco salad kind of person but this
this
this be just so good
also i hear the burger rock
staff-
although -PRON- take a bit for the bartender to get behind the bar i may have be in during the shift change -PRON- be right there the whole time i be there
always eager to make -PRON- smile and get -PRON- what -PRON- need
cocktail and applesauce-(minus the applesauce)- -PRON- have have many on the specialty drink menu and all be good nothing spectacular n = but decent although kinda on the pricy side
overall-
-PRON- will have good eat and good fun no matter midday lunch or a night on the town
p.s-
if -PRON- go late on weekend be sure to dress up
-PRON- be go to settle this once and for all since everyone seem beyond confused about the three china stars in town
-PRON- drive past both of the murray ave china stars every day both locate across the street from a giant eagle presumably just to puzzle -PRON- more and base on the address have confirm the following--
this china star -4219 murray ave in greenfield -at the old location of yen 's gourmet -no affiliation with the china star in the north hills -standard american chinese food the other china star http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/china star pittsburgh-3
-1900 murray ave in squirrel hill -at the old location of pacific ring -affiliat with the china star in the north hills -traditional chinese food
so there -PRON- have -PRON-
a guide to the china stars of murray avenue
-PRON- personally have only order from this china star and can not comment on the other
for chinese takeout and -PRON- mean cheap greasy fry chinese food china star be awesome
-PRON- mean yeah every chinese takeout place with the infamous red menu be pretty much the same and -PRON- feel stupid even write a review of one on yelp
but -PRON- get a craving for general tso 's chicken pork lo mein cold sesame noodles and fried dumplings about once a month and now have try several of pittsburgh 's chinese option base on price and convenience
-PRON- get to say china star be -PRON- number one choice
everything just taste good
-PRON- totally can not justify give a chinese restaurant more than 3 star but next time -PRON- feel the need to pig out on greasy takeout food -PRON- would highly recommend china star
this be one of the good buying experience -PRON- have ever have
the staff be friendly and knowledgable and -PRON- be very patient with -PRON- throughout -PRON- whole experience
-PRON- can not say enough good thing about the staff at centennial toyota

-PRON- have a soft spot for cutlet and be quite picky however this location exceed -PRON- expectation in flavour
-PRON- have try -PRON- spicy garlic the garlic be a little too overpower and -PRON- cream katsu
-PRON- prefer the cream and can not wait to try -PRON- many other option on the menu
the atmosphere be lay back and retro
definitely have a down to earth vibe
server be friendly and quick
-PRON- would definitely recommend this location if -PRON- enjoy cutlet
-PRON- husband be so excited to try this place out and the menu be fill with a variety of option for any pallet

for what the food and beverage cost this restaurant be just ok
-PRON- pay $ 61 for lunch
beer be $ 10.99 each and -PRON- get a small bud light for $ 5.49
-PRON- guess center strip vegas be expensive but -PRON- just seem high for what -PRON- get
premium location on the las vegas strip yield premium price
fun place to check out climb the rock wall watch the game and chat with friend
not a place to hang out all day long and drink unless -PRON- want to go broke
-PRON- be obsess with cupcake
the way to -PRON- heart be cupcake
but the cupcake shoppe have consistently deliver absolutely terrible cupcake over the year which lead -PRON- to petition -PRON- previous boss when -PRON- work in the area to let -PRON- handle the birthday cake purchasing so that -PRON- could stop go here
-PRON- be -PRON- go to because of convenience
-PRON- relent but sadly -PRON- get these cupcake for -PRON- birthday because -PRON- always forget
:p
what make -PRON- so ragey
the fact that the cupcake here be subpar and that the service be poor
what business do anyone have serve crappy cupcake and have a bad attitude
-PRON- be never greet in this store unless -PRON- be in office wear
in the two visit -PRON- have here on -PRON- own time when -PRON- be in the neighbourhood -PRON- be always ignore or coldly treat
-PRON- can forgive poor product sometimes if service be good and -PRON- can tell the management be trying\/work out grow pain
-PRON- can not forgive consistently piss poor attitude with terrible product
what make -PRON- cupcake so terrible
like prairie girl -PRON- be lazy
-PRON- pretty much slap different frosting on the same two or three cake base and call -PRON- different flavour
that be pure garbage
-PRON- show zero effort
like -PRON- say in -PRON- review of pg if all -PRON- do be cupcake -PRON- should be develop different cake base for every flavour and not share cake base for more than 2 flavour or 3 if there be different filling
product design be lazy
the product -PRON- be terrible
the cupcake be always stale and dry
perhaps -PRON- need to be store better or make good
but -PRON- be always always dry and to top -PRON- all off all the flavour taste pretty much the same
in a blind taste test -PRON- would not be able to tell -PRON- apart if -PRON- life depend on -PRON- because -PRON- all taste like too much sugar
and nothing else
the only way to tell these cupcake apart be from the overdose of food colour -PRON- put into the frosting
just no
do not even bother
-PRON- be not worth the calorie at all
go to metro down the street on the other side of yonge the standard cupcake that only come in vanilla or chocolate taste a hundred time good than these
food be great
the turkey spinach wrap hit the spot along with the strawberry cheesecake french toast
this place be small and lay back no complaint with the service
fist -PRON- will say the staff be friendly and the patio have a great view
-PRON- have pretty good drink special
really the only reason -PRON- would ever come here again be to drink on -PRON- patio
the food be quite bland
-PRON- mean the salsa be like runny marinara with some onion in -PRON-
-PRON- order the veggie burrito with no cheese
the thing be load with rice and lettuce save for a few carrot pea and corn here and there
there be no seasoning or none noticeable
-PRON- be be not all bad though at least the ingredient be fresh and not over\/under cook
as state this would be a good place to have a drink on the patio not so much for lunch and definitely not for impress other
colectivo be -PRON- weekend ritual
-PRON- coffee food and pastry be all fantastic
since move -PRON- have yet to find a coffee shop that offer the same great coffee and amazing ambiance
do -PRON- suffer from mild allergy that keep -PRON- stuff up
maybe -PRON- have a head cold and be look for relief
-PRON- have a cure for -PRON-
behold the fusia dog
the amount of wasabi mayo -PRON- slather onto this tube o meat be sure to clear any sinus infarction
these guy be a perfect example of a business that would highly benefit form a reform in the city 's food vendor law
-PRON- location be super small
not really large enough to have seating but -PRON- squish in a few stool
-PRON- would be perfectly suit to a food truck
-PRON- be a small menu of 8 or so different dog home make chip and some salad
while -PRON- would not say -PRON- have a bad location -PRON- be guess that a big part of the reason -PRON- cost almost $ 10 for a fusia dog and a pop be the overhead of rent -PRON- small space in the entertainment district
-PRON- really want to be a regular here
-PRON- food be great but unfortunately the price will not keep -PRON- come back often enough
april challenge 20\/30
fantastic happy hour $ 3 draft and bartender be very attentive
great place to kill some time while -PRON- girlfriend get -PRON- nail do
-PRON- just call to bring in a hard drive for a simple repair pcb board replacement
the guy on the phone insist that -PRON- be impossible
-PRON- be very possible -PRON- just do not have the desire to do -PRON- -PRON- right now
-PRON- guess -PRON- will be do -PRON- -PRON- or take -PRON- to someone with the skill to actually fix something
-PRON- will not ever bring an item to a place that be staff by such dense people
bad experience ever at a nail salon
wait at the counter for awhile
ask for a pedicure please
be seat and a young lady be bring over to -PRON-
-PRON- be on the phone
-PRON- continue -PRON- conversation for a good ten minute when -PRON- say something non decipherable
apparently whisper so as not to disturb -PRON- phone call
-PRON- say excuse -PRON-
-PRON- make a scissor like motion as in
do -PRON- want -PRON- nail cut down
-PRON- say yes please
-PRON- hang up a few minute later and -PRON- phone immediately ring again and -PRON- converse on the phone with -PRON- ear bud in place
-PRON- be sorry be -PRON- pedicure interrupt -PRON- phone call
after -PRON- finish -PRON- pedicure -PRON- abruptly leave without a word
um i'm guess -PRON- be finish by the top coat application
where and how do -PRON- pay
finally -PRON- walk up to the register towards the door and -PRON- come up
-PRON- first word of the day
-PRON- put tip on card
never be treat so rude pedicure quality be average
if -PRON- want rude service at a high price this be -PRON- place
-PRON- really really want to like this place
the concept of improv cuisine be pretty cool but not well execute
the place be pretty packed when -PRON- arrive
so pack that -PRON- be seat at least 30 min after -PRON- reservation
-PRON- do however get free drink to make up for -PRON-
-PRON- can only choose how many tasting -PRON- want so -PRON- go with 4
the only standout be the wild boar bacon
some people at -PRON- table of 5 get the same item as in identical dish for one or two course
there be also significant down time in between the course
the people who get wine pairing think -PRON- be mostly ok
the bad part be that -PRON- all be munch on tortilla chip after -PRON- get home even the people who have more course
if -PRON- be go to be a + $ 50 multicourse meal -PRON- better be full afterwards
some good thing -very accommodate menu
-PRON- tell the kitchen what -PRON- do not want
friendly for picky eater and probably vegetarian
-excellent service
-PRON- would rate this place one star but feel the service add another star
-PRON- still would not go back
-PRON- need to not have so much downtime in between course and good food for -PRON- price
love have fast and convenient italian food in sw vegas
the food be relatively high quality and make when -PRON- order
highly recommend if -PRON- like italian with out always have to sit down for a long meal
wow a bakery that actually bake -PRON- own dessert rather than source -PRON- from elsewhere
these be become harder and harder to come by
owner be very friendly
-PRON- have have the coffee as well as the eclair
eclair be perfect
a small negative
the place only have 18 table cream rather than half and half
absolute life saver
drop -PRON- phone in vegas and -PRON- meet -PRON- lickety split
super fast and amazing service
the service rep be super awesome too
highly recommend
4.5 star back in august 2009
-PRON- decide that -PRON- want to get the brazilian keratin treatment do to -PRON- hair

-PRON- have to admit -PRON- do an exceptional job
-PRON- be go to see -PRON- for a facial next week
price be very reasonable especailly for a salon in scottsdale
if -PRON- have to say anything negative -PRON- have to be that -PRON- have to be in agreement about how small the place be
-PRON- do mention this to the staff
and -PRON- be fully aware
ideas be be throw around to make that experience better
in the end -PRON- have to admit that -PRON- be very picky and choosy when -PRON- come to -PRON- hair
-PRON- take -PRON- three year and many different stylist and salon
but -PRON- now find -PRON- hair a home
in summary excellent brunch make reservation if you can
-PRON- have never be to tupelo honey cafe before and do not realize -PRON- be a sister location to at least one other in asheville nc
-PRON- have always hear great thing but never have an excuse to venture out until recently
-PRON- go on a sunday morning to meet two of -PRON- friend for brunch
-PRON- have an 11am reservation and when -PRON- first arrive there be a few party wait to be seat but -PRON- be quickly give a table
-PRON- will say as -PRON- leave -PRON- be packed and there be many party wait for a table
so if -PRON- can make a reservation
breakfast\/brunch be -PRON- favorite meal period
-PRON- love anything breakfast but when -PRON- go to brunch
-PRON- usually get the everything meal egg bacon pankcake etc
if -PRON- do not do that -PRON- will get the egg benedict
-PRON- decide to go outside the box and order -PRON- breakfast bowl
yum
-PRON- would never have order this because -PRON- be not -PRON- kind of dish but -PRON- would see a photo online and -PRON- look so tasty
plus be a southern fresh food kind of place -PRON- decide to give -PRON- a try
-PRON- be so glad -PRON- do
-PRON- be more than enough food but -PRON- be so good
-PRON- eat -PRON- all up
-PRON- friend both get the blt sandwich which -PRON- seem to like but both complain -PRON- be greasy and -PRON- need to wash -PRON- hand before leave
-PRON- all order coffee -PRON- be good coffee
the goat cheese grit be so tasty
-PRON- love goat cheese but even if -PRON- do not like goat cheese do not let that scare -PRON- away
-PRON- be not strong -PRON- be just savory creamy cheesy
no extra salt or pepper need
while -PRON- wait for -PRON- food -PRON- waiter bring perfectly cook homemade biscuit and homemade blueberry jam\/jelly
the jam\/preserf whatev -PRON- be call be really good
-PRON- would buy -PRON- to take home
-PRON- have a few piece of blueberry in -PRON- but -PRON- be not tough or dry or unwelcomed at all
-PRON- like the piece
-PRON- waiter be fantastic as well
-PRON- be patient when -PRON- need more time and helpful when need
-PRON- be also very attentive and keep -PRON- drink full
let -PRON- know if this review help -PRON- or if -PRON- have any question -PRON- will answer what -PRON- can
-PRON- be very good so give -PRON- a try
absolutely terrible
have 2 meal deliver this be horrible
both dish
-PRON- should be pay -PRON-
-PRON- order delivery and due to the minumum be require to spend a certain dollar amount no problem order two entree figure -PRON- would have the other the next day
the food deliver be as if -PRON- have be sit in a bin for many hour as everything come dry out cold and no flavor
the sweet and sour shrimp do not even have the sweet and sour sauce
-PRON- give these little to go packet of hot sauce and duck sauce
first and last time
-PRON- eat from this place
-PRON- can not find away to take away the one star -PRON- have give this place
oh well
keith nettles be a great guy very helpful and respond to all question in a timely manner
-PRON- replace -PRON- unit quickly and have the good price of the estimate -PRON- get
-PRON- would trust -PRON- for any ac work
-PRON- be honest and helpful
good food bad service
the good food do not make up for bad service here no customer acknowledgement no hi no please no thank -PRON- and no have nice day
-PRON- also take too long to order and pay for item at the counter
get rid of the young girl at the counter and get a couple of clerk with common sense customer service skill who actually want to work there
-PRON- order pizza from this place
when -PRON- open the pizza box -PRON- find ant in the box
-PRON- call and tell -PRON- about the ant and ask for -PRON- money back but -PRON- refuse to give -PRON- a refund will not be go back here again
horrible customer service
-PRON- choose this restaurant because -PRON- girlfriend and -PRON- be look for a place nearby with ayce crab leg
-PRON- only criterion for choose sussex be -PRON- be close proximity -PRON- general disappointment with pickle bill 's and the mostly positive yelp review
the crab leg be probably the good -PRON- have ever have the entire staff be friendly and helpful especially -PRON- waitress barb who be killin the waitress game
the banana cream pie and chocolate mousse pie be also delicious
-PRON- would highly recommend try one of those dessert
overall a very good dining experience
-PRON- will definitely return to gorge -PRON- on -PRON- delicious offering
-PRON- love love chop shop
the scottsdale location be by far the good location with -PRON- quick and friendly service
the food be healthy and tasty
-PRON- can get in and out after a workout real quick or stay and hang out with a fresh juice on -PRON- awesome patio
conveniently locate in the heart of old town
-PRON- would avoid the tempe location at all cost
-PRON- unbelievably slow and -PRON- have forget -PRON- order entirely 3 different time where -PRON- have be leave wait for over 45 min
the extra 10 min drive to scottsdale be well worth -PRON-
this place be amazing
martin and -PRON- crew be very helpful and super informative
-PRON- feel like -PRON- go above and beyond to help -PRON- friend get -PRON- med
first -PRON- have to say -PRON- have be visit this restaurant for at least 5 year now and have never have a disappointing meal
-PRON- read review that say much to the contrary
and -PRON- just have to laugh
-PRON- live in china -PRON- for two year
the food here be the close to real chinese food not americanize stuff throw together like a panda express etc where -PRON- be market to americans
if -PRON- find that -PRON- do not like the food at beijing -PRON- be probably because -PRON- have never have -PRON- prepare like this before
that be not say there be not a place for panda but do not discount beijing if -PRON- have never try -PRON- before because of that kind of comparison review
for reference -PRON- would say -PRON- eat at this place or have have delivery at least 12 time per year on average over the past two year since -PRON- move back to vegas
yes -PRON- chair could use a cleaning or redo but have live in china -PRON- recognize that this be just standard but -PRON- be give -PRON- the four star for this as -PRON- be america and -PRON- do have different standard
love the food
would like to see a sprucing up of -PRON- interior too
last night -PRON- introduce -PRON- friend to -PRON- fiancé
-PRON- take -PRON- a long time to decide on the perfect restaurant for -PRON- all to get together for some wonderful food and drink
-PRON- remember go to havana cafe before and enjoy -PRON- quite a bit so finally decide that would be the spot
sadly this time around -PRON- be not very impressive
-PRON- drink be verrrrrry weak -PRON- food be not flavorful or even display in an appetizing manner
the appetizer and dessert be good but not amazing
-PRON- be not sure why last night be different but -PRON- be different enough to ensure that -PRON- probably will not return
that make -PRON- sad
sadly -PRON- be remind why -PRON- choose starbucks and coffee bean and tea service here be prompt and friendly
a plus for sure
but the coffee be lousy
-PRON- would describe -PRON- as coffee flavor water
sugar and cream do not improve -PRON- black coffee choice
sorry dd -PRON- should stick to what -PRON- do well or make good coffee
-PRON- donut be good
have to do a pre employment drug test and pick this place because -PRON- be the closet to -PRON- house
-PRON- be nervous after read the review and see all of the bad service and wait time that everyone else have
-PRON- be pleasantly surprised that the woman at the front desk be pretty nice
the man that administer the test be not the nice but also be not bad either
-PRON- go around 10:30 am and there be no one else there
so -PRON- be only in there for a total of about 10 minute
overall a good experience
so -PRON- can not complain
the price be not really that bad take into account how big the serving be
the pancake be huge and fluffy so -PRON- can certainly split a meal
kinda remind -PRON- of luke 's diner from gilmore girl just a lot small
looked family own and the customer service be great
the food do not take long and everyone be so friendly
in -PRON- opinion the good hotel in phoenix
the property 's frank lloyed wright architecture really work well in the desert
service be great and what -PRON- would expect from a 5 star hotel
-PRON- recommend that -PRON- book at ocatilla as that be the nice building with -PRON- own concierge
another dime a dozen pittsburgh small pizza shop
pay $ 6 for a slice of red velvet cake and receive a tiny piece be barely an inch wide at the wide spot
pay $ 5.49 for an order of breaded zucchini and get maybe 8 thin strip much less than most place -PRON- have get -PRON- from
a big ripoff and do nothing to differentiate -PRON- from the 80 of pittsburgh pizza shop that be on a similar level
very cute place with nice barosta and ton of book to choose from
great selection of loose tea
for someone who have never see or hear of grabbagreen -PRON- be immediately draw to -PRON- catchy name
the owner be so awesome and personable -PRON- go out of -PRON- way to ensure -PRON- have a positive experience and make -PRON- evening with the genuine interaction -PRON- share
food be fresh and tasty as well
-PRON- will definitely be go back
-PRON- highly recommend this location
awesome service terrific lamb gyro as -PRON- should be
-PRON- love the fry
military discount due to -PRON- be veteran
-PRON- have have mongolian grill in the past
this place by far be the good
from the time -PRON- enter the restaurant the young lady at the register walk -PRON- through the routine
-PRON- even give -PRON- helpful trick
-PRON- love the sauce creation and recipe on the big board
the waitress be friendly and come by to take plates\/bowl off -PRON- table
the price include everything
great concept for a buffet style restaurant
-PRON- will definitely be back
the only limitation be -PRON- stomach
after have be to the st denis mac store -PRON- do not understand how anyone could endure the free standing counter
first let -PRON- mention that this be a pro store mean that -PRON- have a wide selection and offer product otherwise unavailable to -PRON- local mac counter
unfortunately some of -PRON- favorite employee do not work there anymore but the staff be generally really courteous and will either leave -PRON- be or transform into personal shopping assistant depend on -PRON- need
the employee be usually generous with sample sometimes offer -PRON- without -PRON- ask
more than a year ago -PRON- be look for a very specific product when ask the guy just open one of the many drawer and line all the product in a row for -PRON- to see
check every single one of -PRON- -PRON- can vary in color
needless to say -PRON- be win over
just a note the brand increase -PRON- price twice a year there be nothing the staff can do about -PRON-
and if -PRON- have ever be to a mac store -PRON- may have notice that -PRON- employee favor really heavy border on loud makeup
before throw expletive at the lady and dismiss -PRON- expertise hear this -PRON- be contractually oblige to get cake up so -PRON- can show and eventually sell as many product as -PRON- can
-PRON- will be the first to admit -PRON- can get really distract especially since the store have these unforgiv neon light
still a little pricey $ 15 for a meal for one person
pricey consider the portion give
but -PRON- must say the flavour have improve
the jambalaya rice be amazing
and -PRON- have earth friendly container now
definitely an upgrade from styro
love the suya steak
-PRON- seem fitting that other mama would be -PRON- 200th review
the unique name and funky decor make this place pretty different
what make -PRON- worth the 5 star be the food and the service
-PRON- have again just fly back to vegas and have be on the united diet all day
so -PRON- be starve for some good food
-PRON- start off with 12 holy grail oyster
-PRON- be sweet and very fresh tasting
the sauce be a great compliment but the wasabi cocktail sauce be the favorite
-PRON- also have the tuna poke which be really good
the hush puppy be unique and delicious
-PRON- have a couple of drink from the bar agnes and beryl which be like pretty tasty
for the main course -PRON- have the oyster rockefeller which be also very good
-PRON- oyster be very fresh tasting which be really important in the taste
-PRON- also have the nigiri sushi tasting kim chi fried rice and pbr hot pot
the sushi be fresh and delicious
the kim chi fried rice be very good and not overwhelm by the kim chi
the pbr hot pot be the wife 's choice and -PRON- love -PRON-
-PRON- server be santina and -PRON- be great
-PRON- feel well take care of and really enjoy -PRON- fun personality
the bar staff be excellent and help with -PRON- drink choice
the restaurant slightly dim lighting which add to the ambiance
the dining area be well clean and invite
-PRON- have a great time and look forward to another fantastic visit to other mama 's
choose to go to wisconsin vision to get both new glass and new contact
-PRON- be glad -PRON- do because -PRON- get 40 off of -PRON- glass when -PRON- get both
to start -PRON- have very friendly and courteous staff that be more than willing to help -PRON- find what -PRON- be look for and get an appointment book
-PRON- just recently start wear glass and want to get contact because sometimes -PRON- job require -PRON- to go in and out of the cold or heat and fog up lens suck
-PRON- have never have contact before and be really freak out about the thought of shove something on -PRON- eyeball
after -PRON- exam -PRON- help -PRON- out with -PRON- contact and make sure that -PRON- be comfortable put -PRON- in and take -PRON- out
-PRON- leave with a few contact and have order some more
when -PRON- come back in to get -PRON- contact the employee remember -PRON- and ask -PRON- how -PRON- be do with the contact
-PRON- then share some personal advise on what work for -PRON-
with -PRON- glass -PRON- be able to pick out the frame that -PRON- want and -PRON- get -PRON- back in within about a week and a half
-PRON- be able to very easily use -PRON- flex spending card so -PRON- do not have to pay anything out of pocket or hassle with turn stuff in the the insurance company
all in all a great place to get -PRON- vision need take care of
-PRON- would definitely recommend -PRON-
if -PRON- be read this review while consider irepair.ca then consider -PRON- really lucky and stay away from this business
-PRON- will save -PRON- money time and frustration
-PRON- repair create more and new problem
but that be not all -PRON- will also keep the original manufacturer part and render -PRON- phone or computer unable to be fix by an authorized repair shop
food be good and -PRON- get a great deal
while stay in vegas for the long weekend -PRON- read in one of those advertising booklet that las vegas have something call restaurant week
-PRON- be like dine about town in san francisco when restaurant have prix fixe meal at super bargain price
restaurant week run from sept 1 7 and a list of restaurant offer three course meal run from $ 25.08 to $ 50.08
-PRON- make an 8p reservation on the same day during the mid afternoon
-PRON- need a credit card to hold the reservation which could not be cancel less than 2hrs in advance
-PRON- do not know what -PRON- would charge otherwise
since monday be probably the slow day in vegas the restaurant be quite empty and do not fill up until 930p or so
when -PRON- first arrive -PRON- husband and -PRON- be lead to a booth with lush leather seat
-PRON- point out how -PRON- do not have to brush any breadcrumb off the cushion like usual
well -PRON- do not usually go to such a fancy restaurant either
-PRON- choose the 3-course prix fixe special and add an entree tuna tartar in clear tomato juice a free amuse bouche
-PRON- eat -PRON- before -PRON- remember to take a picture
sorry
the most interesting part be the tomato juice which be very good
cheese souffle w\/ watercrest -PRON- have never have souffle before
-PRON- look like a mini muffin cut like moist cake and taste like cheese
fantastic
watercrest be a little spicy
-PRON- do not recognize the taste of the vegetable but -PRON- eat -PRON- all anyway
seared scallops w\/ sweet yellow corn sauce perfectly cook scallop but
the flavorful sauce steal the show
pork loin w\/ mushroom and some sort of dough y bit excellent
the good way -PRON- can describe -PRON- be really great steak except -PRON- be pork
-PRON- have no idea that not all pork be create equal
-PRON- be just a great piece of meat that happen to be perfectly cook and season
-PRON- suppose pork be an art just like steak have different grade
coconut rum cake w\/ vanilla bean ice cream
the cake turn out better than -PRON- think because -PRON- do not really like rum
and -PRON- do not taste any
the coconut cake be good
the ice cream be just ice cream unless maybe if -PRON- give -PRON- more
little bit of peach possibly dipped\/simmer in simple syrup be very tasty
the little sprout be kinda strange tasting
so -PRON- pick -PRON- out
butterscotch mousse w\/ whipped cream and walnuts
another freebie
super buttery taste
but -PRON- just could not finish the little shot glass because -PRON- be just so darn full
will have to remember to avoid the bread next time but the spreadable butter be hard to resist
-PRON- husband and -PRON- do not drink
so -PRON- have two ice tea and a coffee
total tap $ 112 plus tip
that deal be probably impossible any other time at such a fancy place
one of the good quality thai not fine dining thai food restaurant -PRON- have be to and surprise that -PRON- in vegas vegas actually have really good food off the strip too
-PRON- want to try lotus of siam but be bring here by local
and -PRON- be glad i get to eat at this hidden gem good portion
a bang for -PRON- buck
the thai curry be pretty spicy u get to pick -PRON- level
and i do not recommend get anything over a 7 unless u really like heat
pad thai be great good sauce consistency coconut soup be average papaya salad be spicy pretty good but not a typical salad good try thai ice tea -PRON- give u a massive glass i do not think there be refill
-PRON- wish -PRON- could give this shop and the owner larry minus star
please read this before go to this shop
-PRON- take -PRON- minivan in for transmission repair
be tell the fluid be low -PRON- know -PRON- be not low
-PRON- check -PRON-

this have recently become -PRON- go to grocery store
-PRON- be not quite the close but -PRON- generally do not go to lowe 's because -PRON- tend to be a little pricy than -PRON- prefer pay for staple
food lion will not always have everything -PRON- need but for day to day need -PRON- do just fine and -PRON- be not completely baffle by an insane selection
this particular store be actually pretty nice as well -PRON- have an area international\/produce\/wine that have a wooden floor that give -PRON- a quasi upscale appearance and the staff be really friendly as well
heck even the customer here have always be really friendly
the only downside be that -PRON- have notice that -PRON- have a tendency to run out of stock on some item
nothing in particular but certain thing just run out maybe milk one day or juice another
if -PRON- could fix that -PRON- would be sweet
do not ever do business here
-PRON- boyfriend -PRON- have be do layaway here since like march
-PRON- be so excited because this be -PRON- first big purchase together
the owner claim to give -PRON- a discount be super friendly answer all of -PRON- question
the nightmare come to when -PRON- be come back to make -PRON- payment
never use cash here
if you decide to go here
-PRON- need -PRON- own paper trail because this guy come up with all type of excuse as to why number be not add up
pretty much -PRON- go to make a payment like -PRON- usually do -PRON- ask -PRON- for a receipt because -PRON- do not have any of -PRON- paperwork
-PRON- specifically ask -PRON- last time for a recipe but -PRON- assure -PRON- -PRON- do not need one because -PRON- have everything
-PRON- luckily always use -PRON- card but -PRON- boyfriend pay cash so at the time there be like $ 300 not account for
-PRON- should have pull out then but -PRON- be able to resolve -PRON- by use -PRON- memory so reliable
-PRON- excuse be that there be a new owner
blah blah
-PRON- do not have -PRON- original receipt -PRON- need to have -PRON- fax blah blah
but that never happen
once again -PRON- luckily be able to retrieve the original receipt that -PRON- save
anywho after that happen -PRON- still stick with the plan to go ahead continue make payment because -PRON- really like the set
on 7\/6 -PRON- decide to stop by to make -PRON- last payment see about set up the delivery
-PRON- walk in -PRON- kid -PRON- not -PRON- say that -PRON- owe $ 200 more than what -PRON- actually owe
-PRON- be completely flabbergast like seriously
-PRON- be very apologetic last time assure -PRON- -PRON- be not a shady person -PRON- remember -PRON- all this bs -PRON- fall for
-PRON- walk to the car to grab all the receipt -PRON- give -PRON- which be not all the receipt when -PRON- walk back in
-PRON- be like

blah blah
so -PRON- do not feel comfortable make a payment especially with -PRON- bf not be there
-PRON- tell -PRON- that -PRON- will come back in tomorrow with -PRON- man to make the last payment
-PRON- be like okay cool

-PRON- stop by at like 1ish
today 7\/10 -PRON- have a sign that say be back by 3:30pm
so -PRON- go home try to waste time
before -PRON- leave -PRON- try to call to ensure that someone be there before -PRON- drive another 15 20 min to get here
no answer
hmm maybe -PRON- be busy because everyone come back at 3:30 who know
so -PRON- get here by 4:15ish
no one be here as -PRON- see in the video
this be the bad customer service -PRON- have ever receive
-PRON- think -PRON- would be cool to get a piece from the art district
but -PRON- be regret -PRON- badly now
should have just go to a major retailer
just buy a sectional from conns with no issue whatsoever
the guy be super nice but how -PRON- be handle -PRON- be very poor
if -PRON- see this -PRON- may want to return -PRON- phone call
-PRON- be legit in the car outside of vegas furniture write this review
-PRON- still have not show -PRON- be 4:54pm
furniture here get 4 start but customer service dormant even deserve one star
greens be -PRON- everyday lunch spot
there be so many option
-PRON- never get bored
tofu fry extra crispy the bison wrap or the low calorie caesar salad with salmon be to die for
never think eat healthy could be so yummy and addict
love this place
while -PRON- be wait in a 2 hour line for oyster bar -PRON- may as well write this review to kill time
shake shack be definitely good
the food be fresh juicy and really rich
-PRON- get the shack stack which include a fry portobello mushroom that seem to also be infuse with cheese and -PRON- be delicious
-PRON- hamburger bun be unique
-PRON- be really moist and fresh
the meat patty be big than in n out 's
-PRON- will say the burger be really small for the price
this place be pricey for what -PRON- get
the shack stack be $ 9 something and -PRON- be about the size of an in n out burger
the concrete be good but be not really that crazy or special like -PRON- be hype up to be imo
-PRON- get the chocolate with belgian waffle bit
-PRON- be crazy rich and sweet
and dense
and melt fast
the cheese fry be soo good
-PRON- do not normally like crinkle cut
but -PRON- like these probably because -PRON- be smother in cheese
overall -PRON- would say really good but too expensive burgers be much oilier than in n out service be good
place be clean and lively -PRON- get 2 shack stack 2 cheese fry 1 chocolate shake and 1 chocolate concrete with belgian waffle bit and -PRON- be $ 40
-PRON- fry chicken be awesome
-PRON- also have the fry catfish mac and cheese and sweet potato
-PRON- be a good day because of this meal
the cornbread be delicious too
there be a wait since all meat be cook to order so be patient
-PRON- be worth -PRON-
be here with friend for -PRON- 30th food be good and service be great -PRON- pretty much have the whole place to -PRON- self as -PRON- be pretty small
-PRON- favourite neopolitan pizza
-PRON- get the duck confit and the nduja spicy sausage and often the feature pizza be great
argula or beet salad be the perfect size for a green accompaniment
so -PRON- do not feel so over carb from crush a whole pizza which be easily do even for a small inactive frail tender 90 lb woman such as -PRON-
also the budino for dessert because no matter how much -PRON- eat -PRON- still do not gain weight
-PRON- food be great good -PRON- have have since -PRON- last visit south tucson
salsa be always fresh and each time -PRON- taste just a little bit different so -PRON- can tell at least -PRON- think
-PRON- be make by hand
and every tuesday and saturday 99 cent margarita with a meal purchase
limit 4 so -PRON- can not exactly get trashed but these be not dinky solo cup marg either -PRON- be well worth the trip alone
a+ would eat again
-PRON- have hear that the other location be not quite as good as this one so buyer beware
make sure -PRON- be in the right
ahem
neighborhood
-PRON- be there for a big party so the wait staff be overwhelmed
-PRON- family and -PRON- eat here once every 3 month or so
the food be decent
-PRON- be ecstatic when -PRON- find out the sushi burrito trend make -PRON- to toronto and sushitto
on the road definitely meet -PRON- expectation
the service be fast and efficient the wait time be significantly short than -PRON- expect
-PRON- get a full spicy salmon sushitto for $ 16
half order be $ 9 and -PRON- keep both -PRON- and -PRON- boyfriend full for a surprisingly long time
one thing to note be that -PRON- be spicy
-PRON- can eat mildly spicy food but this set -PRON- mouth of fireeeee
-PRON- boyfriend think the ingredient be very fresh and -PRON- be good quality sushi but -PRON- both agree -PRON- be not something -PRON- would come back for everyday
overall -PRON- be definitely a great bite to grab and -PRON- would encourage try -PRON- out for -PRON-
not a bad hotel for the price
the indoor pool be actually very nice with an open greenhouse lounge area pool table and a few old arcade game
the room be not anything special but clean enough
the continental breakfast be just muffin donut juice and cereal
staff be very friendly and accommodate
great find in the area -PRON- be really friendly service spacious as most restaurant in area be a tight squeeze accommodate to little ones(also rare food be fresh and quick
earlier this year -PRON- be under another name
mcramen -PRON- believe
-PRON- server be nice enough to even provide baby cutlery for -PRON- 11month old and attentive even though -PRON- be close to full that night
food be good but mediocre for raman
there be good raman downtown with rich soup base but -PRON- be happy enough with this place for a quick bite
get the stuff grill cheese
do not even look at anything else
just get -PRON-
one of the good thing -PRON- will taste in this city
great food nice wine list surprisingly good service for a new restaurant
menu be a good mix of big plate small bite and appetizer
-PRON- have party of 8 and all be happy
the moussaka and the lamb shank be the favorite
the kid get the lamb burger and love -PRON-
-PRON- really can not believe the overall rating of this restaurant
the lady and -PRON- go through the drive through last night to try a burger and fry
what -PRON- receive be absolutely disgusting
to begin do not view -PRON- as a burger snob that will not eat a fast food burger because that be far from true
the burger -PRON- receive remind -PRON- of mcdonald 's and -PRON- mean that in a very negative way
burger be extremely thin and rubbery
-PRON- believe -PRON- advertise 100 ground beef but if so -PRON- absolutely ruin this beef
after get home and take a few bite -PRON- feed the remainder of the burger to -PRON- dog paco
-PRON- have be a long time user of yelp but never review a place
this be what cause -PRON- to sign up
-PRON- would never be back
although the staff be actually very friendly the burger be overprice
$ 10 for a burger meal compare to a wendy 's combo of like $ 7 8 -PRON- would pick wendy 's every single time
will never return
-PRON- and -PRON- s.o stop by this place after see pic of the drink on social medium and -PRON- be amazed at both the presentation and the taste
some great flavor and artistry
the location -PRON- be warm and invite however a bit small for large group
probably better to go during weekday
but -PRON- also offer to go drink
-PRON- should expand so more people can enjoy this great place
let -PRON- start by say the food be delicious however be prepare to spend -PRON- whole morning wait for food and service
when -PRON- arrive -PRON- be tell -PRON- would be about 25 minute for a table
-PRON- wait one hour and ten minute after the server sit two large group ahead of -PRON- who come in after -PRON-
-PRON- expect to wait but -PRON- the whole system of seating and communication be lack and chaotic
then -PRON- wait 20 minute for even water at the table although delivered water to all the table around -PRON- first
the server be a bit rude and aloof when -PRON- ask for water and be really slow generally
food arrive one order have bacon instead of coconut bacon so -PRON- have to wait for that
and -PRON- also have no cutlery until one of -PRON- get up after about ten minute
the bill never come so -PRON- go up and pay
all in all over two and a half hour for brunch so -PRON- duno
-PRON- be all down for the chill vibe but good process would be beneficial because -PRON- likely will not attend again
would -PRON- like some butter with -PRON- coffee
the butter coffee be city dark blend with coconut oil and grass feed butter with specific ratio
apparently a cup of butter bulletproof coffee can be a breakfast meal replacement
the fat be suppose to increase energy and promote ft burn all day
the barista could not explain why -PRON- be popular to add butter to coffee
o_o butter coffee taste like popcorn and coffee together
if -PRON- want that movie go breakfast experience -PRON- would say give -PRON- a try
this small coffee shop do make delicious look donut in house
-PRON- will stop in again but for donut
-PRON- be a little disappointed in this restaurant
the portion be unbelievably small -PRON- order 4 sushi roll for 2 people and be definitely still hungry
-PRON- mean not even a tad bit full
-PRON- figure that could somewhat be the case but -PRON- seriously think these be the skinniest roll not sure how to describe -PRON-
-PRON- have ever see
not very thick at all
like mini roll
-PRON- taste ok
but -PRON- will say -PRON- table be near the patio so -PRON- be able to walk out and take photo with the water show so that a definitely a plus
the restaurant be also nicely decorate and -PRON- like the huge gold fish tail on the wall outside of -PRON-
-PRON- be excellent
-PRON- feel so great when -PRON- be finsh -PRON- ask the color tan -PRON- would ideally like to be and make that happen
-PRON- look amazing
-PRON- will for sure be go back soon
have a girl day out that start with lunch at villa dolce
-PRON- be the perfect place to sit back and chat while nosh on great food
-PRON- try the eggplant pizza and -PRON- go for the farfalle pasta
-PRON- pizza be incredible
the crust here be perfect
-PRON- be that authentic chewy elastic yet crunchy crust
the combo of the eggplant and ricotta be great
-PRON- be surprised and somewhat ashamed that -PRON- eat -PRON- whole pizza even the lunch size be quite fill
-PRON- feel the same about the pasta
-PRON- look creamy and delicious with chicken and veggie in a lemony cheese sauce
-PRON- just love the decor -PRON- be fun and bright in that new retro way(okayyy -PRON- be trendy enough to make -PRON- bad but -PRON- like -PRON-
as -PRON- say in -PRON- last review though skip the gelato
although -PRON- do have a few other dessert that look nice
extremely slow
22 minute for a chicken sandwich with only 7 people in front of -PRON-
-PRON- appear chick fil a staff be give away food to other airport staff as -PRON- wait
there be only two thing -PRON- need to know about coffee tree 1 the owner\/founder of coffee tree work behind the bar every day and 2 -PRON- roast fair trade organic coffee right behind the bar daily
there be absolutely no reason to head to the starbucks if -PRON- be look for a truly great cup of coffee
this restaurant be from the 70 's and -PRON- can tell
there be an odd smell that hit -PRON- as soon as -PRON- walk in -PRON- be a smell that be obviously rise from the old carpet that need to be replace
-PRON- order the tom kai gai with chicken and when -PRON- receive -PRON- food -PRON- notice the chicken be undercook
-PRON- let -PRON- server know and -PRON- tell -PRON- the food be fine
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- would not eat uncooked chicken
so -PRON- let -PRON- know
-PRON- do not have to
but -PRON- could not order anything else off the menu because -PRON- be not go to pay for -PRON- meal
-PRON- be very disappointed in how -PRON- be treat and -PRON- will never go back to this place
if -PRON- have a no return policy for nasty undercooked food then -PRON- should post that somewhere
horrible horrible service
-PRON- have patronize this establishment for more than 5 year now and -PRON- have always treat -PRON- right
until recently since -PRON- have change several employee
the young guy at the shipping counter have cause -PRON- more grief the last few time go in there and today drive -PRON- to leave this review
-PRON- take a large 70 pound package which -PRON- be quote over the phone $ 69 to ship two state over and after take -PRON- to the store this guy quote $ 88
so -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- have to contact the receiver of the package to see if -PRON- would be willing to pay the difference
in the meantime the young guy go to take a break and leave the counter
a new guy come in and move -PRON- package to a new scale and re quote -PRON-
-PRON- come out $ 2 less
so -PRON- say let -PRON- just get -PRON- do
then -PRON- say to -PRON- that -PRON- speak with the young guy on break and say -PRON- do not approve of -PRON- packaging and need to package -PRON- -PRON- or -PRON- would not guarantee -PRON-
mind -PRON-
this package be the original package from the factory and -PRON- even put in more cardboard reinforcement to boot
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- be not interested in play their game and grab -PRON- box from the scale and tell the man -PRON- people be crazy and walk out the door state -PRON- will take -PRON- business to ups
out loud so every one there hear -PRON-
-PRON- know
-PRON- should have do this after -PRON- hire the new people
-PRON- try pull this game on -PRON- every time since hire the new idiot there
well fedex just lose all -PRON- business
-PRON- be a power seller on ebay and usually take -PRON- stuff in direct
first time here and love -PRON- food
be greet with a hello and a smile and have very fast service
obviously from all the complaint -PRON- read -PRON- would suggest if someone be in a hurry do not come to the drive through
-PRON- eat here and get -PRON- food and dessert very quickly
everybody have a smile and be very friendly
definitely look forward to return
food be fresh and tasty
this place kinda creep -PRON- out when -PRON- arrive
-PRON- have a massive parking lot around back that be not light but scatter with bottle
there be a few car and a dim light come from a well hide door to the alley have -PRON- not be with a group -PRON- may have turn -PRON- car around at this point
after entry there be no sign which door to enter rather something like yes -PRON- be open
try this door
if -PRON- do not work try the other
-PRON- only find out once -PRON- read the review that upstairs be 5-pin downstairs be 10
-PRON- guess -PRON- be use to pay only for shoe at the start then get a lane and pay for the time use here -PRON- be all up front and from -PRON- first impression -PRON- look like -PRON- may have have a few instance of bowl and dash that lead to the practice
the lane -PRON- be be lousy shape
right in front of the foul line the board be bare and fall apart totally throw off a bowl
there seem to be a patch -PRON- work through in -PRON- time there that push each ball bowl over 11 mph the screen show -PRON- bowling speed to the left abruptly before the pin
a few lane over a bowler be launch the ball in the air and -PRON- come to a thud about a third of the way down the lane
-PRON- group remark that any alley owner\/manager\/staff that care would have put a quick end to that the staff here allow that to carry on
poor lane quality run down appearance and expensive
-PRON- will not be rush back
this place be terrible
-PRON- go in and -PRON- stick be in a booth at the back
-PRON- be unbearably hot and stuffy
-PRON- look at the thermostat and -PRON- say 89 degree
that be not acceptable
-PRON- tell everyone who come to the table that -PRON- need to move and -PRON- need to turn the ac up
the waiter tell -PRON- that -PRON- hot because -PRON- there be many grill on
that be straight bs
-PRON- demand to be move and the next table be a bit more cool than the first
-PRON- be too hungry and be not leave til
-PRON- eat
hop the food would make up for -PRON-
after -PRON- change table the service be horrible
-PRON- will never go back to that dump
holy moly hard delicious choice
every little item look beautiful almost too perfect doll house food
-PRON- enjoy the hot cinnamon roll and salt carmel tarte
the presentation be great sweet spot for a desert with -PRON- husband highly recommend
first of all always check -PRON- to go order before -PRON- leave the place
-PRON- place a to go order and -PRON- be miss an order of pancake
mac pancakes be ok nothing to come back for
adobo fry rice taste more like shoyu\/soy sauce
maybe -PRON- will stop by again to try something different hopefully -PRON- will be good
-PRON- just have a late dinner at the new fire pit restaurant in irwin and -PRON- be outstanding
the service be excellent and every item arrive pip hot and delicious
-PRON- start with 2 craft beer on tap then try the pretzel appetizer with whole grain mustard on the side
the burger be make from freshly ground steak and be perfectly grill
the salmon blt with applewood bacon be perfectly sear
the fry be well season and crisp
the staff be all very friendly and attentive
the meal be fairly price
overall an excellent choice and -PRON- will certainly return
now have gluten free goody again
plus -PRON- feel like maybe the coffee have grow on -PRON-
or something about how -PRON- roast or brew -PRON- have actually change in the past year
in any case -PRON- like -PRON- better now
so that be cool
-PRON- usually do not go to ra since the only one that -PRON- think be close to -PRON- house be the one in old town scottsdale and the place be not to -PRON- liking
recently -PRON- discover -PRON- kierland commons location which have a great outdoor seating area and -PRON- be spacious with -PRON- signature red decor
the other thing -PRON- discover be -PRON- happy hour menu which -PRON- must say be probably one of the good in town in term of price and offering
$ 1 sake sushi like salmon and yellowtail for $ 2.50 generous serving for friend calamari for less then $ 4 shrimp cerviche for less than $ 5
this be -PRON- new fav place for happy hour-
-PRON- can hang out here eat -PRON- full drink all the sake -PRON- want without break the bank
tempe camera have be in business a long time
-PRON- be professional and will always take as much time as necessary to help -PRON- buy something or any question -PRON- have about a product
-PRON- be always nice and make -PRON- feel comfortable
-PRON- also think -PRON- be great that -PRON- have the film lab next door
this make -PRON- quite convenient
-PRON- recommend -PRON- to all -PRON- friend and give -PRON- an excellent rating because -PRON- deserve -PRON-
-PRON- be the good camera shop with great price
arlene pollack cleet
no one be able to give -PRON- a ride to or from the airport and car service or public transit be not convenient or feasible so -PRON- decide what the heck
-PRON- would just drive -PRON- and park at the airport
though parking at gtaa parking seem to be the most convenient but price be always a factor at least in -PRON- case
park n fly economy parking lot really come through -PRON- be able to park -PRON- car there for 1 week at $ 40 with the coupon -PRON- print online
in fact -PRON- be cheap than some of those no name airport parking
the shuttle bus show up promptly -PRON- wait be around 10 minute which -PRON- find really reasonable
now -PRON- wish -PRON- can go away more often for mini vacation
just drive -PRON- whenever with -PRON- packed bag
btw if -PRON- be an aeroplan collector like -PRON- -PRON- will be happy to know that by enrol in free park'n fly reward program will get -PRON- 100 ap and at least 50 ap whenever -PRON- park
yay
good placement down on fremont
nice and clean
but -PRON- be expect more local stuff or more whole foods type of place
big disappointment be -PRON- do not have stumptown coffee anymore just pete 's coffee now
meh
every visit -PRON- have make to blue adobe have be a great experience
the food be authentic nm style which be much different than mexican or tex mex
-PRON- favorite choice be the spooning rellenos and cruz kitchen
-PRON- red and green sauce be both delicious
wine pour be generous
server pleasant and professional
the owner be frequently present and be very customer orient
price be reasonable
-PRON- have a pleasant patio which be where -PRON- usually sit
-PRON- do have live music inside on certain night too
this be a super place
give -PRON- a try if -PRON- have not
start of a wednesday morning on the ohio turnpike
-PRON- stop in for breakfast here
2 of the 3 breakfast item that -PRON- ask for at 0900 -PRON- do not have
-PRON- end up get something that -PRON- normally would not get and be not happy with -PRON-
and -PRON- feel like -PRON- just waste -PRON- money
-PRON- need good management run at this location
this be a really really great coffee shop
the open air concept for the cafe be wonderful and give a good sense of flow
the wood floor be a terrific touch and serve to give the space a minimalist and organic feel
-PRON- order an espresso and a mocha both of which be excellent
the menu be simple and direct which -PRON- appreciate over particularly convoluted or extended drink offering at some other cafe
there be a good selection of pastry and other small thing to nibble on
the separation of the cashier station and the drink pickup area combine with all the space mean that -PRON- never feel press in while wait to either pay or get -PRON- drink
one of the nice thing about the open space be that this be a terrific place to have a conversation
even when fill more or less to capacity -PRON- be easy to hold a conversation without need to speak up over the general noise of the cafe or music that be lightly play in the back
the only downside be that this place do fill up and -PRON- can be wait a while for a seat or table especially if -PRON- be come as part of a group
-PRON- be a great place to go drink socialize or work but -PRON- very popularity be in some respect the sole problem associate with the cafe
ultimately -PRON- highly recommend check out quantum coffee
-PRON- be well worth visit
go here on 9\/6\/15
be sadly disappoint
-PRON- be in town for labor day weekend and have a reservation for sunday night
the rack of lamb
-PRON- order be char and fatty and flavorless all at the same time
the carrot be char to a crisp
the squash fritter be pretty good
the plating be pathetic
-PRON- go to gallagher 's steakhouse at new york new york the night before and get a rack of lamb there as well and -PRON- be perfect
terrible overprice bar fare
understaffed disorganized service
-PRON- be not the fault of the staff but if the manager can not figure out how to run a bar -PRON- should not give -PRON- -PRON- money
ribs and the burnt ends be great
do not get the corn on the cob -PRON- be soggy like -PRON- have be soak in water all day
corn bread be good
with rib burn end the pickle -PRON- get with -PRON- be a little spicy
after month of talk about -PRON- -PRON- boyfriend and -PRON- finally decide to check out the antiques\/vintage\/thrift store that -PRON- constantly pass in phoenix
-PRON- end up visit 6 shop and blueberry deluxe be by far -PRON- favorite
the store owner be very friendly and -PRON- happen to visit on a 40 off all vintage item weekend
there be a wide selection of cute clothing shoe and jewelry- both vintage item and locally make piece a small section for man and some adorable onesie for baby
-PRON- end up get a fabulous pair of teal suede wedge
-PRON- be kinda in love -PRON- now make -PRON- somewhat biased toward blueberry deluxe
overall this place be definitely worth check out

that be fine with -PRON-
-PRON- be want to grab some lunch a short walk away anyways

-PRON- figure -PRON- be just say that to cover -PRON- butt in case something come up -PRON- be just get an oil change

-PRON- sit down and start watch the tv
the second guy to help -PRON- see -PRON- and say -PRON- should just be a few more minute
after a 30 minute show finish 's -PRON- walk through the store to see if there be anything -PRON- should get -PRON- grab what -PRON- need and go up to pay again the same guy say -PRON- should not be much long
and -PRON- apologize for the wait
-PRON- add -PRON- item to -PRON- ticket and -PRON- sit in the front room expect to leave soon

this review be be write by a person who come from a food and beverage background
pro the restuarant be aesthetically pleasing
-PRON- be seat promptly and the hostess be friendly
con
-PRON- go there last night for dinner and while -PRON- be crowd -PRON- could not understand why
-PRON- server be unbelievably rude
-PRON- wish -PRON- have get -PRON- name
but -PRON- never introduce -PRON-
-PRON- seem fine at first but -PRON- manage to get on -PRON- bad side
-PRON- serve -PRON- luke warm water -PRON- be not sure if that be -PRON- thing
but -PRON- prefer -PRON- water cold
-PRON- ask -PRON- for cold water and -PRON- seem irritated but -PRON- think maybe -PRON- be read -PRON- wrong so brush that off
-PRON- order food
appetizer be calamari and wing
-PRON- father get the steak taco -PRON- boyfriend get the bison burger medium rare and -PRON- order the fish and chip
the app be okay probably the good part of the meal
-PRON- fish be overcook in old oil and the fry taste freeze
-PRON- tell the server that the quality of the fish be not good because of the old oil and -PRON- response be be that not okay
uh no
-PRON- be pay for quality food
right
-PRON- ask -PRON- to take -PRON- back
and if -PRON- be possible to get another item on the menu steak taco
the taco be mediocre
the tortilla taste old but the steak be cook well
now on to the burger
-PRON- be well do
when the server come by to ask how everything be -PRON- state that the burger be well do not medium rare
-PRON- suppose -PRON- just take that as a statement because -PRON- do not care to do anything about -PRON- or apologize
so now -PRON- be the end of the meal the manager come over to apologize for the fish and chip
-PRON- explain what be wrong and -PRON- excuse be that -PRON- do not have an executive chef or su chef in the back therefore the food be not consistent
do -PRON- really just throw -PRON- restuarant under the bus
okay lol
the bill come out to be a $ 100 and some change for 2 app 3 entree and 4 beer
not too bad but not worth the quality to be honest
the service be slow and -PRON- give an attitude at every request
-PRON- be originally go to give -PRON- 15 tip even with the bad experience because hey -PRON- do not cook the food but change -PRON- to 10 when -PRON- give -PRON- a dirty look and scoft as -PRON- leave
terrible experience
train -PRON- server over customer service
get someone to expedite the food
train -PRON- manager on how to pacify a complaint without throw the restuarant under
would have be 1 star but -PRON- give -PRON- 2 star for the atmosphere the app and the friendly hostess

-PRON- call the extended warranty which apparently be own by van tyle which also own peoria ford and -PRON- be unwilling to help with anything

-PRON- server jbond

all -PRON- choice be on point nothing lack in season everything cook to perfect the temperature portion be just right
sweetbread be something that -PRON- will never make at home so -PRON- always order -PRON- whenever -PRON- see -PRON- on the menu

delicious and clean
-PRON- try the chicken and waffle lemon pond cake chocolate peanut butter and cookie and cream

-PRON- come here on a tuesday night for dinner on the patio
the food be amazing
-PRON- recommend order a few item from the menu to share one from each of the section
-PRON- order the kung pao cauliflower after rave review about this the beef short rib and the albacore tuna
the portion be enough for a light meal for two
-PRON- favourite be the tuna -PRON- have the perfect mix of citrus flavour with the fresh tuna
-PRON- also decide to try the rhubarbara streisand a mixed drink with rhubarb lemon thyme and soda which be very refreshing
-PRON- only pointer be that some of the dish be more expensive for the amount of food provide for example the beef short rib be $ 24
note that the patio be very small
-PRON- fit at most 3 4 group of two
there be however a lot more room on the inside for large group seating
one good thing about the restaurant 's vibe in general be that -PRON- be relatively quiet with not many patron
this make for a great place for conversing
-PRON- would definitely come back here in the future hopefully to try the low tea menu on sunday
amazing
the owner be so nice and helpful
-PRON- let -PRON- try all the flavor -PRON- want

this place be make to keep the yuppie out and the cry baby out so nice thank -PRON- for have a bar to have fun in
if -PRON- come to las vegas -PRON- have to try this place out staff be friendly -PRON- should be because this place be slightly expensive but -PRON- be very good
-PRON- take an uber there twice to eat
-PRON- be in the middle of a mall which be kind of ratchet but never less -PRON- be vegas
do not over order though because seafood be not mean to sit in a hotel
please do not get sick try to store seafood
-PRON- like mr. wei zang
-PRON- be polite honest understanding and respectful
-PRON- do not push -PRON- to buy and be patient
the process of car buying be the easy -PRON- have ever experience especially for -PRON- be -PRON- first new car
the inside throw -PRON- off immediately
like -PRON- step into an old western movie
-PRON- love the vintage collection -PRON- have to give -PRON- that old vegas touch
the other sale manager not mr. wei be a bit pushy and salty after -PRON- have deal -PRON- a good hand in what feel like a game of poker with this guy
-PRON- keep try to get -PRON- to put a down payment on the car -PRON- be already approve for and this be after the deal be do
in the end though -PRON- be able to get -PRON- a low
and -PRON- still walk away with a brand new 2015 kia optima with no money down
that guy be still salty and -PRON- be as happy as can be
chandler arizona be not usually associate with sushi but in -PRON- mind -PRON- be now
-PRON- hold this place somewhat above -PRON- strip mall location in the suburb
-PRON- be not often -PRON- be take by a sushi place like this because this one be a little tuck away all quiet and un assume and bam
great fish
just like that out of nowhere
cheap
-PRON- like a ninja or something
-PRON- get there right before -PRON- be close -PRON- call and ask -PRON- if -PRON- be o.k
first thing be already be wrap up

-PRON- be a total fan of this place
-PRON- do -PRON- for -PRON-
check -PRON- out -PRON- get mad fish skill
:p
over price even for vegas
-PRON- get spicy back sausage which be dry could use more sauce
the sausage be not even spice despite the name
-PRON- do not plan to come back to this chain ever again
there meal be not hard to make so if -PRON- want -PRON- again -PRON- will make -PRON- -PRON-
one of the good thai food -PRON- have till now
panang curry with duck be flavorful and heavenly
pad thai be just ok
not worth the price imo
the interior decor be perfect .not recommend if -PRON- be on a budget as -PRON- be definitely a posh restaurant but -PRON- be in aria and can not expect anything less but -PRON- would still go there just to have the panang duck curry
this be one of the bad starbucks experience -PRON- have ever have
-PRON- stop by on a sunday evening to grab coffee before a long drive back home
-PRON- order a simple drink and end up wait for probably 15 minute to get -PRON- after order if not more
-PRON- be not overly busy instead the barista be chat with some other woman and even make -PRON- a drink before attend to -PRON- pay customer order
-PRON- can have bestie if -PRON- want but do not make a drink for -PRON- and serve -PRON- before pay customer
other people there be kind of stand around not help out the only barista be chatty cathy -PRON- be a bit dirty and the bathroom be gross
-PRON- will definitely be avoid this location
the line be relatively short which make the overall experience pretty good
ordering be simple since the menu be not too extensive and the cashier be friendly
the wait for -PRON- meal be about 15 minute
-PRON- burger be fresh and the shake be pretty tasty
overall good food but nothing to write home about
in and out still beat these guy on burger
4 or 5 visit later
-PRON- be still quite happy with the cut
and of course leo be quite congenial and the staff be quite accommodate of -PRON- schedule for example if -PRON- be run late there be minimum fuss
less over the moon with the the color
the other thing be that -PRON- find l'oreal to be quite damaging
-PRON- think that -PRON- should have pay more attention to the effect of over\/ multiple processing base highlight refresh highlight toner too often
-PRON- be also not that fond of this salon 's main product line kerastase
-PRON- know that one of the deep conditioning product which work really well no less give -PRON- breakout
big fat zero
-PRON- be visit friend from out of town and -PRON- be nice enough to put -PRON- up in -PRON- time share
the unit be spacious the bed be comfy and the kitchen be nice
but the people element be an epic fail
during the first 24 hour -PRON- be solicit for a time share presentation 3 time mind -PRON- these guy be very pushy
-PRON- finally accept and get up early on -PRON- saturday morning for a breakfast and -PRON- presentation
when -PRON- arrive no one be in the office to meet -PRON-
after wait for 10 15 minute an associate come in and attempt to find -PRON- paperwork
-PRON- be unable to find -PRON- paperwork and say -PRON- be not authorize to fill -PRON- out again
oh
but -PRON- can get up early again tomorrow and come back then
wth
so let -PRON- get this right
-PRON- ask -PRON- 3 time to attend this meeting
-PRON- show up forego sleeping in on a saturday only to be deny breakfast that -PRON- promise -PRON- a refusal to fill out paperwork again and an empty offer to come back tomorrow
should -PRON- have -PRON- act together then
no thank
-PRON- waste enough of -PRON- time
-PRON- have date night here and -PRON- be a good that -PRON- make reservation
-PRON- be busy but what place in yorkville be not busy on a friday night
the duck be succulent flavorful and leave -PRON- want more
-PRON- have a ahi tuna tartare on the daily special menu and -PRON- be so glad -PRON- get -PRON-
-PRON- be possibly one of the good thing -PRON- have ever have
the wait staff be very professional and -PRON- have a guitarist playing\/sing during dinner
the ambience of this place for a date whether -PRON- be the first date or one of many be just perfect
definitely will revisit and definitely recommend -PRON-
-PRON- try the latte -PRON- be sooooooo good
-PRON- friend try the hot chocolate -PRON- definitely love -PRON-

delicious food and a not fancy but comfortable atmosphere
-PRON- have never have peruvian food
so -PRON- do not have much to compare -PRON- to
but this place be so good
-PRON- start -PRON- off with some homemade cornut which be crunchy and salty yet soft and buttery mm
-PRON- stick to the same thing every time for dinner
the ceviche mixto -PRON- have the familiar tangy and fresh flavor of -PRON- traditional ceviche with lot of seafood in -PRON- but this be kick up a few notch
-PRON- be spicy b\/c of the chilie -PRON- use and more garlicky and -PRON- have a few surprise in there too sweet potato and inca corn
the loma saltado be a flavor pack stir fry not the chinese kind of onion tender beef strip yellow pepper and tomato in a salty sauce that make -PRON- want to lick the plate clean
that be over top a bed of refri bean and -PRON- so good to mash -PRON- into that sauce
-PRON- also get a side of fry plantain that have a slight sweetness and act as a perfect palate cleanser
-PRON- husband and -PRON- share everything
so -PRON- be very affordable and plenty of food
this place deserve more attention
-PRON- be pretty damm good
-PRON- feel kind of fancy but -PRON- forget about that when -PRON- food arrive
-PRON- have the ceviche which be different but great and then the main course come which be pleasantly fill and satisfying
-PRON- be a steak dish with french fry mixed vegetable and rice- exactly what -PRON- need after a few drink
-PRON- be a bit bummed
-PRON- do not order the fry seafood dish
now listen- order -PRON-

yet another let agent
-PRON- be the most cheerful look one -PRON- have come across which be not say much but just look at that exciting purple exterior and the name -PRON-
mind blow
-PRON- may be able to deduce that -PRON- be a little frustrated with my let agent at the moment
so -PRON- be unfair to take -PRON- out on umega
-PRON- notice that -PRON- let out flat for the festival have just experience -PRON- first fringe festival -PRON- be definitely worth come down for but -PRON- be not sure -PRON- would sign such a contract for -PRON-
umega 's locate in one of -PRON- favourite part of edinburgh marchmont
-PRON- decide to return to cinestarz on -PRON- day off
since -PRON- be a weekday and -PRON- be not the summer for student yet when -PRON- go to see the movie bon cop bad cop 2 -PRON- turn out that -PRON- be the only person in the room while the movie play so -PRON- be cool to see a movie in a movie theatre without any distraction
-PRON- also have -PRON- pick of which seat -PRON- want to sit in
once the summer holiday start for student -PRON- be sure that the theatre will probably be a lot more crowded
-PRON- do not have much to add from -PRON- early review except after watch the movie -PRON- take a look at the arcade machine and -PRON- be roughly $ 1 per game
-PRON- do not go to watch movie as often as -PRON- use to since -PRON- have -PRON- netflix subscription and -PRON- cravetv subscription and -PRON- television subscription but -PRON- have no reservation about return here if there be a movie that -PRON- really want to see

the butternut squash risotto be delicious and compliment the seafood nicely

owner beware
don't use this company if -PRON- want long term tenant
everyone who work here be really sweet and probably hardworking
but all of the food here do not taste good
-PRON- be look for a new dentist\/dental office and find -PRON- -PRON- yelp -PRON- and see the review
and so -PRON- make an appointment
the staff be friendly and helpful
-PRON- need to get some crown and -PRON- be amazed that -PRON- be not pay an arm and a leg
-PRON- be a nice small office and -PRON- have tvs in the room to help pass the time in the chair
-PRON- do not miss much about portland but what -PRON- do miss -PRON- miss a lot
with specific regard to good eat -PRON- miss lew 's dairy freeze where -PRON- sell almost mystical coney island hot dog what the hell do -PRON- put in that sauce
-PRON- be great
-PRON- also miss sumida's
sumida san be sushi chef of the first water train as a sushi master since boyhood -PRON- be the real deal
-PRON- love to go to sumida 's for lunch and watch sumo on the big screen tv sumida san have a satellite dish live sumo and eat until -PRON- feel like -PRON- be go to explode
so good so relaxed so
homey"
-PRON- even get know who be who in sumo
flash forward through sf to scottsdale and directly to dozo
no sumo on the big screen but everything else be right at dozo
robert the sushi master and owner be as scrupulous about -PRON- fish and process as sumida san be and the result show in the sushi and sashimi beautiful feast for the eye and a treat for -PRON- palette
-PRON- have a business lunch there yesterday that be right -PRON- be get to pick the lunch spot again -PRON- have the sushi and sashimi lunch
a bargain at $ 13!
nigiri sushi and sashimi along with a salad and miso soup
the sushi and sashimi be chef selection and always present beautifully create fresh for -PRON- in the moment by the sushi master -PRON- be go to go into detail about what -PRON- make for -PRON-
but -PRON- know what -PRON- sushi experience will be different
and -PRON- should go to dozo and try all of -PRON-
-PRON- have
-PRON- be a sublime experience
-PRON- think a good sushi master know what -PRON- want good than -PRON- do -PRON- lunch companion be not a sushi fan and go for the salmon teriyaki -PRON- pronounce -PRON- some of the good -PRON- be ever have always a reasonably good indicator of satisfaction
there be not much more to tell -PRON- about dozo
-PRON- do not know if -PRON- be the good in town -PRON- hear good thing about yasu but -PRON- may be the good in scottsdale
if -PRON- have sumo on the big screen -PRON- may never leave
domo arigato mr. roberto
bleh
-PRON- have try a lot of pizza place and this be so bad
the crust be not homemade pretty sure
-PRON- see -PRON- take -PRON- out of a plastic bag and -PRON- sure taste yuck
-PRON- be not very hot either
-PRON- be definitely go elsewhere next time
the service be great the manager come up and introduce -PRON- but at the end of the day -PRON- be the food that should be rat and -PRON- be tasteless
-PRON- be so disappointed as -PRON- love italian food visit italy every year for the last 20 year
-PRON- be excited to have an italian restaurant on -PRON- doorstep
-PRON- will never forget this place because -PRON- be here at the plaza that -PRON- take -PRON- first conscious bite of a fry cheese curd
a dive for sure
-PRON- do not remember this bar have the most character
but -PRON- be nice because -PRON- can drop by in the late afternoon perhaps in jean and a wife beater with no makeup and eat greasy food and cheap alcohol and not have to worry about a darn anything
except the calorie -PRON- be consume
because -PRON- live about a block away -PRON- would stop here out of convenience
-PRON- have a great time play pool here on a few random occasion
really nice server
but the place be full of really really drunk people and kind of dingy
and -PRON- be only 7 pm on a friday
-PRON- do not see anything special except for the giant patio
-PRON- will definitely go there second time
-PRON- fry chicken be the good -PRON- have ever eat in montreal
-PRON- will try the boneless chicken next time
-PRON- also like the fry shrimp and pig foot both the quality and quantity be very good
-PRON- do not like -PRON- steam dumpling
this place be awesome

-PRON- have an awesome day at the pool
-PRON- know -PRON- be celebrate -PRON- anniversary and bring -PRON- a complimentary bottle of champagne which be delicious
if -PRON- ask for something -PRON- will get -PRON- here at the scott
-PRON- only recommendation for management be that -PRON- have more than one guy run the pool restaurant and bar order
otherwise -PRON- be very pleased with -PRON- stay thus far
bad parking location
bad customer service
this be -PRON- first time with caesars
-PRON- do not know -PRON- so -PRON- defiantly need help at anytime
however the service disappoint -PRON-
also -PRON- pay the resort fee which include the 2 person wifi but the wifi do not work
all in all this hotel do not worth the money that -PRON- pay
the furniture be old and the smell of the room be like dust
go to wynn for the similar price or just go to bally or paris
at least -PRON- worth -PRON- money

-PRON- be so happy
-PRON- find this place
will be come back
-PRON- forget to get a stamp card though and use the 10 off
make sure -PRON- check in for that offer
this place be a joke
the food be a joke
the service be a joke
the big joke be the security who in -PRON- mind think -PRON- be above all authority
-PRON- hear horrible thing about this place all the time
and -PRON- should have never go
-PRON- do not understand why there be always a line friday and saturday night
-PRON- suck
this place have great dim sum and serve -PRON- 24 hour a day
although late night -PRON- have a very limited menu
will satisfy -PRON- late night craving
every time -PRON- come here the restaurant side be busy- but the dance floor be quiet
the food be delicious- but expensive
also there be a mandatory service charge on -PRON- bill
-PRON- only complaint be that -PRON- extremely hard to flag down a server
-PRON- do not visit -PRON- table enough
however classy ambience to host a dinner and dance with friend
the dance floor be small but never crowd
there be usually only like 4 10 people on the dance floor at a time
-PRON- really warm on the dance floor though -PRON- should put a fan there
the good thing about this place be the patio outside
fresh breeze as -PRON- be close to the water
nice place to have a few drink with friend on the patio
jack 's auto alignment brakes offer -PRON- some of the bad customer service -PRON- have ever experience in the automotive industry
bring in an 06 scion xb on coilover that need height adjustment set all around and a basic alignment to follow
-PRON- call ahead of time to schedule an appointment and make sure that -PRON- could take care of this request
-PRON- happily schedule state that the height adjustment would be easy and the alignment would be no problem of course and the car be take in as schedule the following week
after work on the car for 20 minute be give the key back to the car and tell to leave -PRON- do not do advanced alignment setup apparently and the tech yell at -PRON- state -PRON- be a waste of -PRON- time in a very rude and disgruntled manner
there be no apology or explanation give
be just rudely yell at instruct to leave and give the key
what kind of shop in this day and age have the audacity to do this to -PRON- customer
if -PRON- could rate this shop a negative 1000 star rating -PRON- would
a simple apology genuine explanation and a courteous wave goodbye would have be fine and -PRON- would not have take the time to write this review
in summary stay far far away from this place
rude and dishonest staff terrible service awful experience
negative star
so beautiful and cute
there be so many creative barbie with different outfit
love -PRON-
must pass by to look
as with anything in las vegas if -PRON- be pay the high price along the strip -PRON- expect to be pretty impressed
but eat brunch at the sugar factory be just plain meh
-PRON- will admit -PRON- be kind of in a hurry
so -PRON- do not have time to really study the menu or yelp review to decide what would be really outstanding -PRON- just pick the first thing on the menu that sound good and order standard mimosa
-PRON- do notice while wait for -PRON- food that every single table around -PRON- have order these large fishbowl drink with gummy candy on top and dry ice bubble out of -PRON- so -PRON- must have miss out on that experience because -PRON- be clear that be
the thing to order
the brunch food be simply unexceptional
-PRON- feel like -PRON- could have get the same quality at a diner for 1\/3 the price
-PRON- may come back for just drink or dessert since that seem to be -PRON- specialty but not again for a full meal
southern fried chicken the bomb
food be hot and so be bubba 's son
most definitely come back
the owner be very rude
be busy get -PRON- pedicure and do not even attend other customer
when ask to book an appointment do not seem very interested
no customer service
-PRON- go to this place after read the review however i just discover that the review be not genuine as -PRON- be all the relative who work there and have just post review to attract customer
this be -PRON- first meal when -PRON- get to vegas
great atmosphere right by the canal
food be very very good especially the crab cake and the drink
good service
love the cilantro rice
the service be horrible and -PRON- be so slooowww every time
even if -PRON- be just one customer and one worker
this time -PRON- be 3 worker the girl and one customer in front who be now pay
-PRON- sample an ice cream flavor and no one come back to get -PRON- order
too busy clean and answer the phone
do not even speak to -PRON-
horrible
see that -PRON- be about to leave and do not say a word
finally make -PRON- to this hidden gem inside the d. loved -PRON- waiter miguel
the food be beyond delicious
-PRON- even surprise -PRON- with creme brûlée for -PRON- birthday
-PRON- will be back very soon
opening of door pleasant enough clean and amicable surrounding sit quickly by friendly staff irma and same as -PRON- waitress
picture be sadly good than the food -PRON- breakfast special be overdo egg and french toast waffle be good
the tuna croissant be too hard to palate -PRON- can pass on any future visit here as -PRON- have not yet turn into the millennial that like to overspend just quite yet
when the store buy lemon cake be the highlight of -PRON- meal -PRON- know -PRON- just piss away 20 buck
never again
this place be preatty good but kind of expensive side i would recomend not to come too hungry like -PRON- and order alot of food
overall the staff be helpfull and the place be very clean
-PRON- come with with an uncle- and cousin in law to watch ufc 141
-PRON- be a relatively busy night but the service be very lackluster
the drink girl come by twice technically once to take -PRON- order and once to deliver -PRON-
even though -PRON- keep an open tab -PRON- only have one drink since -PRON- never come by again to ask -PRON- for another one
bad move since -PRON- would have purchase more drink if -PRON- have come around
this place have no food offering at all no snack appetizer etc
no outside food be permit either
the guy at the door say something about -PRON- that -PRON- could not allow food since -PRON- allow smoking
whatev
bad business decision since -PRON- would be wise to have -PRON- patron pay for food and drink instead of pay only for drink and smoke for free
the projector use to broadcast the show be slightly fuzzy
-PRON- would have expect a good projector or tv setup and the sound system show significant sign of use
-PRON- be about time for -PRON- to either replace some equipment or maybe tune up what -PRON- have already get
for a $ 10 cover -PRON- be not too bad of a place to watch sporting event but -PRON- would rather find a good place to watch the next event
-PRON- forget to add every time -PRON- go -PRON- be pretty slow -PRON- have be in large group so -PRON- just attribute -PRON- to that
but -PRON- would not count on speedy service
this be actually a very nice restaurant inside and have a great location
-PRON- be a pity a good restaurant do not take over this location as the food be mediocre and the service be awful
not sure if the heat -PRON- be feel at breakfast be due to the near 100 degree weather at 9 a.m. or the spicy huevos rancheros from very unique el encanto mexican restaurant
yes -PRON- hot out
but that should not stop -PRON- from head up to cave creek and give this restaurant a try
for those not brave enough or smart than -PRON- be to handle the az heat especially during the summer month -PRON- can sit inside
if -PRON- do dine inside make sure especially if -PRON- have kid to get a window seat by the pond to see the duck turtle occasional fish and on -PRON- last visit an owl
-PRON- decide to sit outside as -PRON- get there early enough before -PRON- start get too hot outside mister be on so that make -PRON- very comfortable and enjoy the live music on the patio
the rustic mexican furniture fit the theme perfectly with mexican blanket as seat cushion
the guitar player be really good and -PRON- 2 daughter definitely enjoy the entertainment
until 11 a.m. on sunday not sure if this be always the case so make sure -PRON- give -PRON- a call before -PRON- head in -PRON- have a great brunch to try out some of -PRON- menu item
-PRON- do not believe -PRON- can order off the normal menu during brunch but many of -PRON- top item be available during brunch
so -PRON- should be happy either way
the pollo fundido be awesome as well as the huevos rancheros
everything -PRON- have try so far have be delicious
can -PRON- tell -PRON- be a fan
as -PRON- 5 year old daughter who be a big fan of mexican food like to say after -PRON- finish up -PRON- breakfast and get to feed the duck this be the good place eveeeeer
if -PRON- be up for a fun experience and great mexican food give el encanto a try
-PRON- will not be disappoint
tl;dr stick with the classic and -PRON- be golden
lot of hit and miss but -PRON- could shape up to be a great place
atmosphere 5\/5 the place be really nicely decorate and the table be comfy and roomy
-PRON- remind -PRON- a lot of asian kfc which make a lot of sense
the chair be comfy and while there be a lot of place to sit -PRON- be not too cluttered to navigate easily
-PRON- really like -PRON- wall art
-PRON- be loud so -PRON- may be kind of hard to hear at time
menu
3\/5 -PRON- menu be limit right now so double check -PRON- order because -PRON- may not have -PRON- in stock yet
there be some definite hit and miss
for example the cheeseling be terrible but the sweet spicy and original be great
beware of thing that do not look like the picture provide
quality
4\/5 -PRON- be take an extra point off for how old and cold the cheeseling -PRON- friend order be but the rest seem pretty good in term of quality
-PRON- can even see the steam when -PRON- break open a piece of chicken
the side dish be not worth -PRON- in -PRON- opinion except for maybe the biscuit
rice be mushy and cole slaw be watery
service
2\/5 beware -PRON- be very very slow right now
but hopefully once the employee get into the swing of thing stuff pick up
-PRON- do not take off any star for the wait which be hopefully a temporary thing
when -PRON- go on open day -PRON- wait about an hour for -PRON- order
the employee be nice enough and -PRON- be helpful -PRON- just get the feeling -PRON- be under train and under staffed right now
also -PRON- really wish -PRON- would put the water dispenser as a self service thing same with plate -PRON- do not default get any
so -PRON- have to ask for -PRON-
-PRON- have wet wipe with -PRON- condiment which be great because -PRON- be go to get messy
the management consist of six fingered albino banjo player
this place be a shit hole over crow and understaffed
this place be recommend by -PRON- boss
-PRON- get the thin crust pizza with cheese
the sauce be not too heavy and the pizza be cook well do
-PRON- friend enjoy -PRON- as well
-PRON- would recommend this place
-PRON- do not like the food
counter be dirty
food look like be out for a long time
the dessert bar be cute
disappointed
service at the bar be excellent
sadly every hour be happy hour -PRON- find out when -PRON- visit at about 4 p.m.
so glad -PRON- do not look down on -PRON- or give -PRON- bad service for cash in on a free birthday burger offer
2 star miss because the burger come out warm
-PRON- mean the burger have no sizzle or steam
-PRON- have have fast food burger hot than that thing
-PRON- offer endless fry but offer about 12 with the entree
necessitate -PRON- request for another round of 12 fry
-PRON- seem silly to be honest
put enough on the first plate
so -PRON- do not have to ask for more
jeez oh man
-PRON- have love red robin for awhile but with so many other option i would not go out of -PRON- way to go back
great concept but -PRON- need to work out the bug
-PRON- could not ring up happy hour price food take forever to get in -PRON- seat although the food be very good once -PRON- arrive
-PRON- forget item bar be super slow and frustrating
but only 3 day in so let -PRON- hope -PRON- get -PRON- shit together
-PRON- would be absolutely worth the money not cheap if -PRON- back up -PRON- service kitchen and bar up to par to command those dollar
-PRON-
need this place so hope -PRON- do not screw -PRON- up past opening
the two good thing about this place the patio during a cool night and the happy hour
the happy hour have an amazing beer deal and keep -PRON- come from more
-PRON- also like the pretzel appetizer on the happy hour
but that be pretty much -PRON-
every time -PRON- have try the food -PRON- be upset
every time -PRON- get seat -PRON- receive the bad service
bad food bad service and overprice regular drink
-PRON- will stick to come during happy hour
-PRON- be -PRON- husband 's birthday and -PRON- be in search of a really good burger
nothing fancy no kimchi or giant portion of any kind
just a good old fashioned tasty burger
-PRON- search lead -PRON- to boulder city
-PRON- really like the theme here include burger like the bugsy the bonnie melt and the 45 special which be what -PRON- husband choose
the 45 special come with 3 type of cheese swiss cheddar and jack
order this medium rare and with a side of onion ring
-PRON- order from the appetizer menu and get plain chicken tender
-PRON- have the option of get -PRON- mild or spicy as well
-PRON- choose the ranch dressing
-PRON- burger come out exactly how -PRON- order -PRON- and the onion ring look fresh batter there at the restaurant
unlike most place -PRON- serve a good amount of onion ring
-PRON- burger come with lettuce tomato and onion and be perfect as the juice start run down -PRON- arm as -PRON- bite into -PRON-
-PRON- get 4 very large chicken tender heavily batter and fry to a crunchy texture
the meat -PRON- be very juicy and tender
-PRON- ranch be very flavorful as well
the food here be really good
the theme inside be great
-PRON- be however a bit dark
-PRON- need some warmth inside
-PRON- be hard to see everything and the bar be also dark
-PRON- waitress sit at the bar and text which be not cool
there be a few tv show various football game and some outdoor seating on the sidewalk
fun place but too dark for -PRON-
people here be nice service be good -PRON- can actually find help if -PRON- need -PRON- except for the deli where the service always suck
and -PRON- mean always -PRON- be always clean and -PRON- be close to -PRON- house
-PRON- do not know why people complain about this place
the only thing -PRON- would complain about maybe be the crowd
the food have always be awesome -PRON- be not the world good pizza but -PRON- be pretty flippin good
the wing be awesome the garlic knot be well season and where else can 4 people legitimately eat dinner for $ 5 each
for $ 19.99 -PRON- offer a family deal with an xl 1-topp pizza 6 garlic knot and 10 wing
-PRON- keep -PRON- and -PRON- 3 college roommate full so -PRON- should keep -PRON- full too
the service could be slightly good but -PRON- always have the good sporting event on and if -PRON- be important enough with sound
-PRON- love the place and would recommend -PRON- to all
second time and -PRON- be just as great
the veal parm be to die for- order -PRON- with a side of fettuccini alfredo and -PRON- will thank -PRON- for -PRON-
if -PRON- be look for a barber can give -PRON- a great fade come see rustle
and -PRON- will take great care of -PRON-
definitely a master of -PRON- craft and chill dude
be get complement all day on -PRON- haircut
-PRON- write a genuine one star review about a week ago on google and -PRON- appear la fitness staff have have -PRON- remove and replace -PRON- with 4 new fake 5 star review
this be laughable
-PRON- guess -PRON- can not handle the truth about how disgraceful -PRON- gym and customer service be
so -PRON- will re post -PRON- review each time -PRON- remove -PRON- as -PRON- feel like the people deserve the truth about this awful health club and the people who run -PRON-
april 11 2016
women 's workout room smell like mold locate so close to the pool without proper ventilation -PRON- seem like an unhealthy place for people to workout
also if -PRON- be a woman -PRON- get disturb by some of the creepy male staff who work there while -PRON- be work out in the main gym
one male employee in particular interrupt -PRON- workout to tell -PRON- that i be do everything wrong and to come in for a free personal training session with -PRON-
-PRON- then ask for -PRON- number and think -PRON- be a trainer as -PRON- be dress in a la fitness uniform -PRON- give -PRON- to -PRON-
that be a mistake
-PRON- soon find out from a friend who work at the front desk that this individual in particular be a gym predator not a trainer and do this frequently -PRON- be part of the sale staff
for several day after that -PRON- pester -PRON- with inappropriate text message ask -PRON- sexual question like do -PRON- like suck d**k for example
when -PRON- would see -PRON- at the gym -PRON- would ask -PRON- inappropriate question about who -PRON- be date and inappropriate question about -PRON- body
-PRON- feel so uncomfortable -PRON- would only use the woman 's work out room to avoid this person
if -PRON- be a woman -PRON- be not uncommon to feel sexually harass at la fitness by the staff that work there claim
-PRON- have hear from -PRON- gf 's in miami la and here in mississauga as i experience first hand
when i bring up -PRON- discomfort and concern with the new general manager nick -PRON- literally tell -PRON- -PRON- could not do anything about -PRON- and that -PRON- be a matter
-PRON- would have to deal with -PRON- by contact the la fitness head office
-PRON- be astonish by the treatment -PRON- receive from the new gm as -PRON- express zero empathy for the sexual harassment and uncomfortable position -PRON- have be put in by -PRON- staff member nor do -PRON- go out of -PRON- way to help -PRON-
-PRON- then leave and call the head office and feel even more dissatisfied with the rude way -PRON- be treat over the phone again by a male employee
-PRON- have feel so uncomfortable go forward that -PRON- have stop attend the vega blvd location on a regular basis this membership have be a waste of money for -PRON- personally a gym -PRON- join out of convenience because -PRON- be close to -PRON- home
the good part of -PRON- all
and -PRON- say this sarcastically be how the new gm suggest that -PRON- attend another la fitness that be totally out of the way across town
after -PRON- la fitness experience -PRON- would not recommend this gym to any woman who want to work out at a safe place and -PRON- say safe place in reference to a place free of sexual harassment and a place free of moldy workout room if -PRON- be a woman sequester to the woman 's only room
this company do not value woman 's comfort nor do -PRON- take seriously claim of sexual harassment
la fitness have the bad customer service -PRON- have ever experience
and -PRON- would never recommend this gym or -PRON- franchise to anyone
as someone who have experience -PRON- service in canada and the us -PRON- can truly say this gym be not a place of quality -PRON- be filthy and not maintain the equipment be disgusting rarely clean and visibly dirty plus key machine be often out of service for maintenance
at la fitness customer do not come first and this statement be verify by the treatment -PRON- have be give first hand by this club and the head office as -PRON- have do absolutely nothing to rectify the sexual harassment -PRON- have personally experience or attempt to right this wrong whatsoever
buy a car from here while live in california
-PRON- price be good than anything close and -PRON- be willing to go through a lot of extra trouble to take picture and allow -PRON- to send a 3rd party inspector
-PRON- also set up ship -PRON- to -PRON- as well as secure of ca tag for -PRON-
-PRON- even refund $ 56 to -PRON- because the tag be cheap than -PRON- estimate
the whole deal go really well -PRON- wife and -PRON- be very happy with the purchase and -PRON- would recommend -PRON- to anyone
there be no shortage of good burger place in the phoenix\/scottsdale area so -PRON- be a tough space to operate in
the food be pretty good but the atmosphere of this place be tragic and totally counter to the concept of a speakeasy or mob theme burger place
first -PRON- be very bright and many of the spotlight be poorly aim
second the place feel like -PRON- run out of money or be on a tight budget as -PRON- be very spartan and also very quiet no music or ambiance at all
finally the service be mediocre slow and generally blah as the staff show little hustle or enthusiasm for -PRON- job
very bummed out be hop this place would be a cool dark and delicious new spot to add to the rotation
oh well back to zin burger or rehab burger or delux or stax etc etc etc
the service be great
however the food be awful
-PRON- be too bad that everything be over season with rosemary and thyme
everth -PRON- eat taste the same with those two seasoning
-PRON- do not know who think this be a great idea but this overpower season on all of -PRON- dish need to go
-PRON- have to brush -PRON- tooth 3 time to get rid of the taste
have the team from noble out to clean -PRON- couch
-PRON- enter the home like -PRON- be there be and make sure to keep tidey
the work -PRON- do
-PRON- be very happy with and would recommend -PRON- to anyone look for a professional group to clean -PRON- carpet or furniture
finally be able to stop into nana 's for lunch today
this location join salsarita 's and yuyu 's at the corner of oak lake and tyvola
-PRON- arrive around 1:00pm in the afternoon and the restaurant be probably 40 fill
-PRON- order the fried chicken small plate lunch which entitle -PRON- to two piece of fry chicken leg and breast two side and choice of bread and drink
-PRON- choose the mac and cheese and the green bean along with cornbread
the chicken be juicy but lack something in the taste
the mac and cheee be smooth and mild but tasty
the green bean be okay
the cornbread be pretty dry though
and hard
the total for -PRON- meal come to eight buck and change
-PRON- will definitely consider come back as -PRON- have a bunch of option for -PRON- meat and two and -PRON- begin serve breakfast 04\/11\/11
the service be great cafeteria style and the staff be friendly
-PRON- recently have to relocate -PRON- entire charleston office to charlotte due to hurricane matthew
the omni sales department be so helpful and accommodate
-PRON- team thoroughly enjoy -PRON- stay and have not stop say good thing
although certain thing could have go smooth overall this be a great experience
thank omni
food be great
service fast and friendly
-PRON- eat here often

and by the way -PRON- have some of the best iced tea in town
-PRON- love sakitini
however -PRON- be really disappointed because -PRON- call at 12:50 to order a california roll to go
ps -PRON- close -PRON- kitchen at 1am
the guy on the phone tell -PRON- -PRON- close -PRON- kitchen down early because -PRON- be slow

what make -PRON- bad be that -PRON- open until 2
unsatisfied customer

-PRON- review may be a little biased because -PRON- girlfriend have some serious stomach issue the same night -PRON- eat there
-PRON- be not sure if -PRON- be the food or the enormous amount of alcohol
-PRON- have that make -PRON- feel sick the next morning
the food be actually fairly good
the margaritas be definitely too sweet and the service be pretty good also
have a blueberry muffin that have real fresh blueberry and -PRON- be not ruin by be drown in sugar
-PRON- be extremely picky about -PRON- coffee
lilac 's organic bean be smooth and the milk be steam perfectly with the correct ratio

studio one lie hide away in a basement in the west end -PRON- be a veritable treasure cove of useless yet desirable little knick knack
-PRON- mum use to come here for stock filler when -PRON- be wee
and that be probably the good way to describe the content of the shop -PRON- be full of stock filler
admittedly there be some useful bit and piece like hideously expensive cookware heart shape le creuset casserole dish -PRON- want and some decent enough item of jewellery but who want to bother with boring stuff like that when there be fortune tell fish and worry doll beckon to -PRON-
this be a fantastic shop to visit if -PRON- be in need of an inexpensive and interesting present for someone

but service be slow and -PRON- never come back to ask how everything be
and -PRON- have to call -PRON- to bring -PRON- more water and for the check
the dish be probably the bad bibimbap -PRON- have ever have and -PRON- be $ 13 at lunch which be at the expensive end for this dish
and -PRON- forget to include spinach what be bibimbap without -PRON-
and the egg be so raw that the white be still runny
the gochujang sauce be so blend that -PRON- do not add anyflavor to the dish
-PRON- have not properly season any of the veggie that be in the dish so the whole thing have virtually no taste
then immediately after eatomg -PRON- get a headache and -PRON- find out that -PRON- do use msg in the sauce
so -PRON- be sure that -PRON- use msg in -PRON- other dish especially bbq marinade and hot dish
if -PRON- be allergic to msg definitely avoid the restaurant
-PRON- have have bbq there and -PRON- be decent nothing special
also try hot casserole dish another time

so -PRON- know -PRON- be the couch and not something else
pool\/lazy river look great online but be just ehh in person
water down drink $ 6.50 bottle of beer over chlorinated water again just ok
other than that no major issue just not worth the money
for this price -PRON- will take the family over to firesky in scottsdale
-PRON- have be a patient of dr. tolans for many year
-PRON- make -PRON- sad that -PRON- be not give -PRON- 5 star but -PRON- be so displeased with -PRON-
first of all -PRON- have be try to get an appointment to see -PRON- for two day
-PRON- leave multiple message to get an appointment yes no one answer the phone at -PRON- office -PRON- have to leave a message for melody
then when -PRON- finally reach -PRON- -PRON- never call -PRON- back -PRON- can not get -PRON- in for two week
this be after -PRON- go in a week and a half ago with pneumonia\/bronchitis or whatev -PRON- have
-PRON- never even tell -PRON- what be wrong with -PRON-
-PRON- load -PRON- up with medication and send -PRON- on -PRON- way with no follow up appointment say if -PRON- need to come back to call
well now -PRON- can not get an appointment
-PRON- be change doctor

-PRON- do not
like most doctor in las vegas
-PRON- be a number a paycheck that -PRON- receive
so now -PRON- have to scramble to find someone to see -PRON- because -PRON- have already miss so much work
this should have be a follow up appointment to see that -PRON- be actually okay after -PRON- see -PRON- a week and a half ago
-PRON- be so sick when -PRON- see -PRON- last time
-PRON- husband think -PRON- would put -PRON- in the hospital

perhaps when the tech hear express -PRON- automatically hear cheapo none the less -PRON- be a good tipper not to mention that -PRON- get a pedi every other week religiously
so -PRON- can do the math
in the past -PRON- would regularly pop in here for a quick adequate unfriendly pedi this time -PRON- be less than that
the kid that do -PRON- pedi be in such a hurry to go have a smoke get back to -PRON- macpro that -PRON- leave -PRON- w\/ toe that look like -PRON- be paint by me(not good
the only word speak to -PRON- be pick color now -PRON- be not look for a new bff but come on

come past 6pm for -PRON- meal time special come with a free jasmine tea lychee tea milk black tea or milk green tea with purchase of any main
order the taiwanese popcorn chicken with rice and chicken risotto and 2 order of milk black tea base on what be popular on yelp
the popcorn chicken be decent
-PRON- would say good than mediocre because of the black rice
the chicken risotto will not meet -PRON- expectation for real risotto but -PRON- rendition be acceptable tasty
-PRON- expect the milk black tea to be pre make for high demand since -PRON- be during the meal time special but again just ok
would not order -PRON- on -PRON- own for full price
-PRON- would not shoot -PRON- down or really recommend this place

-PRON- only complaint be that -PRON- keep sit -PRON- by the door to the patio next time -PRON- will request a different table
the hostess be very pleasant this time though
-PRON- be so pleasantly surprise by this place
-PRON- live in the neighborhood and have pass -PRON- by so many time expect -PRON- to be an aladdin's level place which -PRON- be not a fan of be the falafel and shawarma snob that -PRON- be
-PRON- boyfriend and -PRON- stop in for happy hour food and drink at the bar on -PRON- way over to the indians game last night though and have a great experience

-PRON- have sit in several different section here and there really be not a bad view
-PRON- usually opt for visitor bull pen seat
cheap close to a variety of food tcby entertain and -PRON- could even catch a fly ball
beware the steepness of the upper deck
chase field or the bob as -PRON- still call -PRON- be a very family friendly park
can not beat a live ball game w\/ ac in the summer
do not be trick by these other two foolish review
cutlet house be mediocre at best

all kind of run of the mill not so special\/memorable place to eat that -PRON- can find anywhere else in the us
but the cracker barrel

-PRON- would be to a cracker barrel
be when -PRON- be 8 year old and visit orlando

one night -PRON- have dinner at a cracker barrel
and -PRON- would never experience anything like -PRON- before
rock chair on a big porch out front while -PRON- wait for a table a gift shop full of stuff that -PRON- want but maybe do not need and classic all american fare
for cheap too
as -PRON- pull up to the one here in peoria -PRON- spot the rock chair and smile broadly
-PRON- be just like -PRON- would remember
through the gift shop -PRON- could reserve a table and shop while -PRON- wait
-PRON- find a cute az souvenir for -PRON- sister and within a few min -PRON- be seat at a big table in a room that resemble a massive country home family room
-PRON- be cozy -PRON- be interesting and the menu kick ass
-PRON- get the cracker barrel dinner special that include a variety of small plate so -PRON- could try a lot of different item
there be pickle okra chicken and dumpling ham cook two way corn mash potato and more
even though the food be just slightly above microwave meal quality there be something comforting and awesome about -PRON-
nothing blow -PRON- away
but -PRON- just love -PRON- anyway
maybe -PRON- be the memory of be small and have never see a cracker barrel before maybe -PRON- be just the name cracker barrel who know
but -PRON- would still pass up all those other chain for a cracker barrel no matter where -PRON- be
nice guy
love how -PRON- take reservation for some and not for other
-PRON- call in and be tell no reservation
but as -PRON- be wait a man walk in with a reservation

the chef even come over and be super nice- ask -PRON- how -PRON- like everything
-PRON- whole group really enjoy everything -PRON- get but -PRON- be not the big fan of the cuban sandwich-
-PRON- be a little dry
-PRON- will order something else next time
note
the fry be delicious
-PRON- be obsess with the aioli -PRON- serve and the chef be nice enough to bring -PRON- some extra

that be a shame because tentacle be a staple in -PRON- dim sum book
-PRON- would give this place a solid 3.5
service be fast and efficient

how to avoid crowd and have the place to -PRON- for a while
get there at 10 a.m.
watch the mystery train movie downstairs then go up to the 4th floor and watch those movie
then go back down to the exhibit hall and start -PRON- tour upwards
the hall of fame movie be an hour long so -PRON- may want to watch only some of -PRON-
if -PRON- park the great lakes science center garage next door -PRON- can get -PRON- parking validate
metered parking be free on weekend
enjoy a great museum
-PRON- concierge recommend that -PRON- have lunch at milos
when -PRON- walk into the restaurant there be a big display of fresh fish
-PRON- sit down and the waiter bring over a sunday lunch special menu but say nothing about the main menu till -PRON- ask
-PRON- assume that -PRON- want the less expensive lunch option
-PRON- then ask for a simple substitution from the menu instead of an apitizer and main dish -PRON- want two apitizer
that seem to be a big deal
-PRON- ask for the heater to be turn on 3 time and -PRON- be never do
the branzino fish be simple but very trasty
-PRON- just wish that the waiter have good communication skill and management be just more on top of what be go on
delicious introduction to raw vegan food -PRON- 3 course sampler for $ 15 be a steal and always the way to go in -PRON- opinion
wonderful build out of re purpose municipal building
great central location down town
nice fringe benefit breakfast happy hour food and drink
gorgeous clean room
and the nice staff -PRON- have ever deal with
only negative no room service and no safe in room
all around great value
awesome food and service
-PRON- also support the military and veteran with a discount
love the sos
trap on the wrong side and super starve after -PRON- workout this be not the fix -PRON- need
-PRON- be average on food great on customer service
-PRON- like the cute corner spot to eat as -PRON- want to be hide from anyone at this point
order half sandwich\/soup combo
meh
the tomato basil be chunky too sweet and miss the main ingredient basil
the chicken pesto signature sandwich be no superstar but provide nourishment for -PRON- wither body
highlight pickle spear and baked chip
-PRON- be too young for this crowd though -PRON- adore old fashion charm and wit
-PRON- think -PRON- rather do wildflower or paradise for this cost of blah
at least paradise have chocolate chipper and wildflower have the good hand lotion in -PRON- bathroom
this place have horrible customer service ever
-PRON- go there to get -PRON- full face wax today just now
-PRON- usually go to a place on willodale and sheppard to get -PRON- full face wax do eyebrow chin forehead sideburn and everything for $ 25 and because the place -PRON- go to close early today -PRON- rush here to get -PRON- full face waxing do here hop to get the same decent service that -PRON- get elsewhere
however the lady be so rude and -PRON- tell -PRON- that full face wax for $ 25 do not include eyebrow and if -PRON- be to get a full face waxing and -PRON- suddenly raise the price to $ 35 if -PRON- want to get -PRON- eyebrow waxing as well
what be the point of get full face wax when a part of the face be not include in the job
and when -PRON- tell -PRON- that -PRON- will not be pay extra $ 10 -PRON- start swear in -PRON- own language
horrible customer service
the price be decent- not too expensive
however -PRON- get what -PRON- pay for
the quality be not the good
-PRON- would rather spend a little more and get sushi that be much good quality
there be way good other option in the area
kelly 's use to be -PRON- favorite happy hour in town
then when -PRON- have 8 colleague in from out of town kelly 's be the place -PRON- suggest
so imagine -PRON- surprise when -PRON- walk up to the door at 5 p.m. on a monday night and the door be lock
no one answer the phone and there be not any indication on social medium that -PRON- would be close
guy what happen

some day -PRON- be just crave for a super tasty salad
naturally enough this be -PRON- go to place besides -PRON- kitchen to get a grubbin salad
-PRON- also have pretty tasty soup and a little bit of pasta to munch on as well
-PRON- would definitely recommend -PRON- hit up each and every one of the bread
stick b\/c
-PRON- be the bomb
plus -PRON- switch -PRON- menu seasonally to keep -PRON- taste fresh and appealing to -PRON- customer
sweet tomatoes be convenient fresh and the staff be always very friendly
the only downside be the price -PRON- think -PRON- be $ 9.89 the last time -PRON- go for lunch so be prepared to shell out some money for a nice salad lunch
but if -PRON- get on the email list -PRON- give out coupon regularly so that be
a + 1
the good buffett -PRON- ever visit
everything be just different and great
the waitress -PRON- have be super nice and helpful
so friendly
the food come in little nice container like a small fry basket for the chicken wing
-PRON- offer out of the ordinary food item
everything in small portion so that -PRON- can try more thing
the roasted bone marrow be very tasty
but make sure to leave room for dessert

normally -PRON- do not prefer indish food but this be very tasteful
-PRON- love this place
the protein pancake keep -PRON- come back
a low carb option -PRON- let -PRON- splurge on a tasty breakfast without too much guilt

-PRON- even have sugar free maple syrup just ask
check the hour to avoid disappointment -PRON- close around 2 pm
-PRON- will not have much of a wait if -PRON- come during the week at lunchtime but expect a long wait time if -PRON- want to eat at peak breakfast or brunch hour on weekend
always friendly service and good food
love how -PRON- leave a big carafe of ice water on -PRON- table
so -PRON- never have to wait for a server to refill -PRON- glass

xs do an incredible job in host talent to draw club goer in las vegas
so as -PRON- can expect look out for long line and a beautiful crowd
in -PRON- opinion the good look crowd in vegas
despite the crazy number of people that be here every night xs staff do a great job of organizing and serve the hoard of people
as always -PRON- recommend table reservation at any club to maximize -PRON- overall experience for the night
-PRON- only gripe about xs and the only reason -PRON- do not get five star be the music format
-PRON- be exclusively edm music
not that -PRON- do not love edm but -PRON- can only fist pump for so long
-PRON- love hip hop and would love to see an open format on different night
essence be the future of medical dispensary very professional friendly and helpful staff reasonable price for high quality medication and a very clinical atmosphere
all medication be lab test and the staff be knowledgeable about most if not all of the product available
-PRON- have be twice before and each time the wonderful people there such as heather and crystal have make -PRON- feel like a special guest and patient as oppose to the atmosphere and service at some other clinic
since the medication be lab test -PRON- always know what -PRON- be get and price be fair with special sometimes give -PRON- fantastic price although in general everything be a bit more costly than in california
one of the good bar on queen east
staff be attentive and very astute to detail
the back patio be a quiet beautiful little retreat in the summer
-PRON- even offer a very simple light menu to satiate little craving as -PRON- enjoy the evening
sherri at the center bar be beautiful and generous with -PRON- customer service
keep up the quality work
a stunning fancy and beautifully put together hotel
absolutely pricey so definitely up to -PRON- if -PRON- want to pay that much for a room -PRON- will hardly stay at since -PRON- in vegas
however -PRON- do think -PRON- a beautiful place to stay if -PRON- have say a bachelorette party or something more private where -PRON- will mainly remain indoor that way -PRON- get -PRON- money worth
first time
have a wonderful experience get a mani\/pedi
-PRON- look over the atrium
-PRON- be as if -PRON- be on vacation
the technician be very warm and welcome
-PRON- would go back

-PRON- go to the lodge quite often and like the company that amber and crystal and chevy provide
-PRON- be a plus that the food good in a place -PRON- do not expect -PRON- to be
-PRON- want to point out that -PRON- rating be somewhat on a relative scale -PRON- be gauge -PRON- sunday brunch experience last week against -PRON- high expectation of reid 's
-PRON- have be a big fan of the grocery store and have be patronize -PRON- since -PRON- be day back at 7th street station
-PRON- have follow -PRON- since yo the selwyn location good burger in town btw
and therefore be really look forward to the brunch experience at -PRON- new location at southpark
experience be totally underwhelming
the selection be limit -PRON- frequently run out of basic like yoghurt and smoke salmon and the food taste average at good
on a positive note -PRON- server be very attentive
disappointed to give one of -PRON- favorite place in charlotte such a bad review but need to be honest
-PRON- husband and -PRON- go here last night for -PRON- 1st anniversary
the food be amazing however the overall experience be subpar
-PRON- arrive about 20 minute early and go to the bar for a drink
the bar be pack and very loud
so -PRON- be really look forward to sit at at a nice quiet table
but -PRON- be not
-PRON- table be right by the bar
-PRON- be so loud and people be stand right by the table
-PRON- be also disappointed to see people in hoodie and jean the minute -PRON- walk in the door
-PRON- be disappointed that there be not a dress code enforce
-PRON- waiter be very nice and attentive but -PRON- wait a long time in between course
-PRON- sit down at 7:30 and have an appetizer and salad
-PRON- steak do not arrive till after 9
now -PRON- be all about enjoy an evening out
but that be too long to wait
by the time -PRON- steak arrive -PRON- be not even hungry anymore because -PRON- have fill up on bread wait
for the price that -PRON- pay -PRON- do not think this place be worth -PRON-
there be a lot good steakhouse in pittsburgh for less money and -PRON- will receive a good overall experience

die bedinung war freundlich aber etwa gelangweilt gewesen und deshalb doch sehr störend bei nem date
die preise sind auch ein bisschen höher aber wie gesagt der ausblick entschädigt für alle
-PRON- must say this be one the good recruiting agency -PRON- have work for to say the least professional informative great communication awesome pay rate
not to mention this agency continuous to communicate with -PRON- while on -PRON- assignment
the agency actually reach out to -PRON- for a position within -PRON- area and -PRON- be a philadelphia resident
unlike many recruiter who have contact -PRON- in the past for position beyond -PRON- commute -PRON- be very shocked at the detail -PRON- recruiter be able to provide during the first point of contact
-PRON- recommend this staffing agency to anyone who be look to build a professional job seek relationship to meet -PRON- unique need

proportion of rice to topping be fine
however
as a chinese person live with a chinese family -PRON- always wipe down -PRON- dish and utensil even when -PRON- be already on the table
the white napkin be brown after -PRON- wipe the inside of the cup and soy sauce dish
nuff say
bye
so -PRON- will start off by say a 2 be a generous rating
-PRON- do not leave very many review but feel -PRON- need to today
the temperature in this restaurant be so cold -PRON- should bring a jacket and glove to eat
-PRON- take 45 min to get -PRON- food where half of -PRON- be cold
mind
-PRON- there be only about 6 table full
then the good part -PRON- be allot a whole 7 min
that be right
-PRON- time -PRON- before -PRON- be ask if -PRON- be finish and give the check
this single reason be why -PRON- feel inclined to write such a negative review
to write a positive note the waiter be pleasant and some of the food be good catfish baked apple and cheese grit
-PRON- think when -PRON- walk in and see the small and pedestrian surrounding that -PRON- can not expect much
but when -PRON- take the first bite of a rib or the first forkful of the out of this world mac n cheese -PRON- realize that all the money and love go into the food
and the service be fast and friendly
so the fact that -PRON- use plastic utensil and to go container for the side be barely noticeable
although the menu be a little limited in choice the price be good than most other bbq joint -PRON- have visit
-PRON- highly recommend this place and will be bring -PRON- friend here
the walmart photo center be a joke
-PRON- order card online and when -PRON- pick -PRON- up a day later -PRON- be print on the wrong size paper leave a giant white strip on the side
when -PRON- call -PRON- be bounce around from associate to associate because the manager theresa do not want to deal with -PRON-
-PRON- will not be order from -PRON- again
picanha rice french fry salad
-PRON- forget the bean
but -PRON- just see -PRON- when -PRON- get home
-PRON- be super interested on the bean
besides that
-PRON- be delicious
-PRON- order udon fry squid and eel pancake
-PRON- be all taste similar
-PRON- be quite bored that chef probably use the same spice
the fry squid be even a little bit bitter
so there be no much to recommend
-PRON- find this place on yelp review
-PRON- be not at all familiar with the charlotte area and -PRON- be look for a non chain breakfast place to meet up with -PRON- son who be drive up from south carolina
this place do not disappointment
the food be delicious and have a flare that be different from -PRON- traditional diner breakfast fare
for example -PRON- french toast be prepare with ciabatta bread as oppose to regular white bread
one of -PRON- son 's order the chicken and waffle and the portion be huge in addition -PRON- get to pick a side
the portion be generous the quality be delish and the price be reasonable
most important -PRON- server be attentive even though the place be busy with a line out the door
-PRON- food be serve promptly and -PRON- do not feel rush to leave -PRON- table
will definitely use this as a regular meeting point in charlotte
ps if -PRON- be up late at night -PRON- be open until 2 p.m. and still serve a limited food menu
-PRON- stay here over super bowl weekend for saturday and sunday night
this be -PRON- first time stay here
-PRON- originally book 5 room for two adult in each one king bed
once -PRON- check in -PRON- find out -PRON- be upgrade to the brand new ivory tower suite that have be newly renovate
these room however have two queen bed
-PRON- consider switch back but that would put -PRON- in -PRON- old room
once -PRON- check out the new room there be no go back
the room have be do beautifully
-PRON- be modern cozy and clean
the decor be very w hotel mod
-PRON- be nervous about stay off the strip but the palms do not fail
-PRON- have a total blast and stay on the property almost the whole weekend
-PRON- also cruise across the street to check out the old gold coast casino which be really fun to find $ 5 black jack table
-PRON- have go to 3 different location for kinton ramen
-PRON- friend and -PRON- be just walk along church street
not go to lie the only reason why -PRON- stop in be because -PRON- have a sign that a pitcher of sapporo be $ 9.99
luckily -PRON- be able to convince the other to come in and try some raman
-PRON- ordering system be fairly simple
-PRON- can choose either chicken or pork choose the broth noodle and extra such as seasoned egg garlic etc
-PRON- can have a combo for $ 12.99
so -PRON- get the raman and choose from 3 dish to have with -PRON-
-PRON- normally get the shoyu broth
but -PRON- do not come with an egg
-PRON- have to have the egg
yeah -PRON- be be cheap and not pay the extra $ 1.50
-PRON- do prefer the shoyu broth
so -PRON- get the original pork raman with gyoza
-PRON- love the pork belly
-PRON- be delicious
-PRON- use to be able to finish the entire bowl
but -PRON- guess with old age
-PRON- can no longer stuff -PRON- like a build a bear
-PRON- be very filling and -PRON- can order extra meat if -PRON- be crazy hungry
if -PRON- like get yell at upon enter and leave an establishment in another language then this be the place for -PRON-
haha but joke aside the staff at all location have always be very friendly
-PRON- need to collect more stamp to get free stuff though
slowest starbucks drive through ever

love starbucks but not come back to this one
-PRON- have be order pizza from red rock for 10 year

needless to say -PRON- be a completely different experience from the other dealership
-PRON- go to a few day earlier
-PRON- be up front on what -PRON- could do on the pricing buy -PRON- dinner
so -PRON- could stay and finish up the finance paperwork and most importantly -PRON- drive the car home for -PRON-
that be so awesome of -PRON- be that -PRON- live 45 minute away in queen creek
this save -PRON- an hour and a half round trip in come to get the car
david be -PRON- sale guy and extremely nice
ask for -PRON- and -PRON- will be great to work with
cute store good customer service and -PRON- have a maternity section
-PRON- may be kinda small -PRON- be sandwich between baby and kid but -PRON- be big than the maternity section at h&m or macy 's in the same mall and -PRON- have a good selection of inexpensive maternity jean top and dress
thank heaven there be a place for -PRON- to get preggo clothe that fit properly and be well make
-PRON- mean just because -PRON- be knock up do not mean -PRON- want to wear pant in size small medium or large
so glad to be able to try on and buy jean that fit and come in numbered size and several length
-PRON- visit el pastor a few night ago and be a bit disappointed
-PRON- have bookmark -PRON- base on a few review and finally find the time to go for dinner
-PRON- order the chicken fajita which be usually a hit in most place
-PRON- do not know what -PRON- be
but -PRON- do not really enjoy -PRON-
-PRON- think maybe -PRON- be because there be not really a mexican flavor who know
either way the fajita be def not a hit
-PRON- will be back to this place though
-PRON- have a large menu and -PRON- be possible that -PRON- order the one bad thing on the menu
also -PRON- have a bar one that be separate from the actual restaurant
-PRON- can not discount this place until -PRON- have truly experience -PRON- bar
only a monster would do that
and -PRON- be no monster
-PRON- would give this place 2.5 star for now but look forward to update -PRON- review after another visit
this restaurant have the bad service i have ever experience
-PRON- walk in with a friend around 2 or 3 and only one third the table be use by customer
nobody greet -PRON- at the door so after a minute or two of stand there i have to find someone -PRON- tell -PRON- just to sit down wherever i want so -PRON- do
-PRON- sit there for over 20 minute and a waiter do not come to -PRON- table even think the table next to -PRON- have people in -PRON- and -PRON- waiter see what be go on -PRON- do not do anything finally after more than 20 minute -PRON- friend ask the other party waiter who -PRON- waiter be
and -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- would find out
at least 5 minute later a girl come over and take -PRON- order
-PRON- be nice the food take a long time to get there -PRON- only order one pizza to share two water
the food be good though
underwhelm by -PRON- dining experience at searsucker there be so many good chef drive restaurant in scottsdale
very trendy decor but the dining experience just do not delivery
chef malarkey roam the dining room promote the taste but -PRON- would have better serve -PRON- restaurant have -PRON- spend the evening in the kitchen
the entire dining experience be rush -PRON- be in and out for dinner in little more than and hour
the egg and bacon small plate be cold which be sad because the flavor be promising
the chicken and waffle and frank small plate be also cold
the filet be underwhelming
the short rib small plate be redeem
the duck fat fry be greasy and again cold
the brussel sprout be well burn not caramelize and douse in vinegar
-PRON- be disappointing that a meal that be so rush be serve cold
the server be also not interested in -PRON- comment about dinner disappointed -PRON- opt not to order dessert
-PRON- will choose to dine elsewhere and skip the hype of searsucker
this nail salon be very clean with a really nice set up the staff be friendly
-PRON- get a gel mani for -PRON- wedding -PRON- be a bit pricey for what -PRON- have do
but -PRON- be happy with the outcome
these guy be the real deal
the only thing miss be a sign on the door that say gentlemen welcome to -PRON- first step toward manhood
brandon have knock -PRON- out of the park every time
every time
-PRON- have be come here for almost a year now and -PRON- usually always love -PRON- nail when -PRON- be do but the past 2 visit have be terrible
a couple week back -PRON- get a gel and pedi from one of -PRON- new hire and during the pedi
-PRON- be so rough with the pumice stone that -PRON- have cut all over the bottom of -PRON- foot
and -PRON- ask -PRON- to be a little more gentle
and -PRON- just continue
then -PRON- start -PRON- gel and as -PRON- be take off -PRON- gel -PRON- cut up -PRON- cuticle like crazy
-PRON- be very painful
then -PRON- mess up -PRON- gel
so -PRON- have to go back to -PRON- chair and have acetone pour into -PRON- open wound
-PRON- finger be sore for 3 day
but today -PRON- have a fantastic experience with kim -PRON- nail look awesome but when -PRON- get to check out -PRON- charge my for a mani\/ gel when all -PRON- want be a gel change
so -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- only want a gel and all -PRON- say be well -PRON- give -PRON- a mani too
so -PRON- just pay -PRON- and get the hell out
will definitely be look for a new nail salon
the price be high for diner food in southwestern pa but the quality be not any high nor be the portion large
-PRON- be across from the harley davidson dealership by allegheny county airport
the gimmick of the restaurant would be the saucy attitude of the wait staff
problem be -PRON- do not enjoy the gimmick if the staff be jokingly rude but never let up and the food be the same quality\/portion as other place -PRON- would go but the price be slightly high
dunno
-PRON- immediate takeaway be if -PRON- be try to feel young and buy a harley for that reason -PRON- imagine this be one of the place -PRON- would wind up eat on a semi regular basis 2-star
there be not anything wrong with the food and -PRON- would probably eat there again if someone ask -PRON- to meet -PRON- there if -PRON- be really set on -PRON-
pretty clean korean bbq restaurant
small portion plate but good for the price
-PRON- want white lice rice
lol
-PRON- go here for the first time last weekend
although drink service be fine forget about the food
the menu have very limit choice but -PRON- do not really matter because only a few actually get food serve to -PRON-
-PRON- wait for appetizer for a couple of hour while watch the entertainment and never get -PRON- order
no apology just attitude
on -PRON- way out -PRON- encounter more people that have the same experience
too many other option to bother return here
-PRON- always stop here when -PRON- be in pittsburgh
pastrami be good
server be friendly
leave with a full belly
-PRON- can not believe the good fortune -PRON- have land on this place
and by landing -PRON- mean that quite literally
-PRON- immigrate from the us to canada and land around noon and go straight to -PRON- then empty apartment
not sure whether -PRON- should sleep in a hotel that day -PRON- try -PRON- luck by go unannounced into brooklyn furniture at 3pm
three hour later -PRON- apartment already have a fantastic sofa bed and a gorgeous round table with 6
classy chair
louis and -PRON- wife the owner be so generous and accommodate and the fast response time from the mover who carry -PRON- purchase that same day be purely due to the owner request
not only that -PRON- have some credit card trouble at the time -PRON- american bank think the charge be fraud so the owner just let -PRON- pay half and trust -PRON- to come back three day later to pay the rest without -PRON- leave any deposit or document of any sort at -PRON- disposal
talk about generosity
this be a true mom and pop furniture shop in the good sense of the word
louis\/susan if -PRON- be read this thank -PRON- so much for make -PRON- move to toronto so easy
if -PRON- want to be like the cool kid definitely make a stop at grouchy john 's
-PRON- feel immensely cool just by step inside and see -PRON- decor and patron
this definitely remind -PRON- of a coffee shop -PRON- would come across when -PRON- live in downtown nyc
funky music come out of the speaker and eclectic art hang on the wall that -PRON- can actually buy if -PRON- be interested in pick up some artwork with -PRON- coffee
as for -PRON- menu they've get a wide range of flavor and concoction that -PRON- be sure will satisfy -PRON- tastebud
-PRON- good friend do get something with nutella and -PRON- only complaint be that -PRON- be a little too thick
-PRON- really appreciate that -PRON- have almond milk as an option because not all place will offer that
-PRON- definitely enjoy the ambiance and could see -PRON- just hang there get some work do sip on some coffee
this place be pretty good all thing consider
-PRON- be a cool space that be well lay out
however much like the build a bear workshop have a million option do not make a cool look bear
-PRON- usually end up with a bear that have a paw where -PRON- wang should be and be dress like a cross between a policeman a princess and the devil -PRON-
-PRON- be -PRON- own fault that -PRON- build the most structurally challenge burger in the universe but -PRON- feel like -PRON- waiter should have step in at some point and say just because the topping be free do not mean -PRON- have to put -PRON- all on one burger -PRON- jack as
one hilarious bite later and -PRON- have squirt every topping -PRON- have right into -PRON- basket
this leave -PRON- with a hang dog expression and a naked burger
the burger -PRON- be really good pepper crust bison but -PRON- recommendation be give one of the pre make one 's a shot
morty 's steakhouse be the one that -PRON- friend rave about
-PRON- also get the mushroom tempura and some crazy fry both of which be relatively good but seemingly have be sit on the warm for a pretty long time
-PRON- also have alcoholic milkshake but -PRON- be so thick that -PRON- feel like -PRON- be be punish for order -PRON-
-PRON- will definitely go back once the crazy crowd die down to get a good sense of this place
there really be a ton of burger option to be explore
1st time but not the last
-PRON- both really like -PRON- chicken ka pao and -PRON- app
do take out with quick service and nice people

graz kitchen fresh be a hidden little gem south of the chandler mall in a modern setup of local business within one space

-PRON- be out of fry so end up with chip and salsa
the salsa be good flavorful with some heat

to be honest -PRON- can not rate the bean
but -PRON- hand pour soda be absolutely fantastic -PRON- in house bake good be great sweet and savory and -PRON- ice cream kawartha dairy -PRON- think be well serve
on -PRON- next visit ask for a mixed soda -PRON- be not on the menu but a lime ricky + orange be -PRON- current favourite

for less than $ 7 -PRON- can get a hearty cheeseburger and a basket full of beer batter fry

-PRON- potato skin be yummy too
cheap price for the good burger in town
-PRON- be a bit worried at how deserted sls look when -PRON- stop by on a weekday evening and become even more worried when -PRON- find katsuya just off the casino floor look just as empty
then again -PRON- be come right at the beginning of happy hour and reassuringly the restaurant begin to fill with patron
here -PRON- call -PRON- social hour and there be discount drink and small bite
-PRON- stick with several craft beer as well as an assortment of bite
the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno and the spicy albacore sashimi with crispy onion do not disappoint and perhaps the real highlight of the meal be the baked crab hand roll
service be also professional too there be an asian american waitress whose name -PRON- can not remember but be really sharp and on top of thing
definitely a happy hour worth seek out in an area just a bit north of the main action on the strip
-PRON- go to the north scottsdale location for -PRON- daughter 's 18th birthday last night 5\/11\/2017
-PRON- call to make a reservation for 15 people for 6:30pm when -PRON- open at 11:00am and be tell -PRON- do not take reservation until 2:00pm

-PRON- daughter really want to go to cheesecake factory otherwise -PRON- would have go to a place that take reservation
-PRON- large party show up at about 6:20 and -PRON- be of course tell -PRON- would be a while
a party of 17 have just show up right before -PRON- get there
-PRON- have to wait in the crowded waiting area for an hour to be seat and when -PRON- do -PRON- be very cramp
-PRON- server do a great job consider there be so many of -PRON- and the food be pretty good but -PRON- think -PRON- be ridiculous to only take reservation during lunch\/early happy hour time

-PRON- have have several of the burger here but just recently try one of -PRON- chicken sandwich
oh my
-PRON- have emilio 's chicken sandwich -PRON- be wonderful
but then again what be not to love about a bacon crust chicken breast with guacamole jalapeno bacon poblano pepper mayo and mozzarella cheese
-PRON- have the perfect balance of sweetness and heat
the staff be extremely friendly and the food be quite good
-PRON- take pride in what -PRON- serve and make sure that -PRON- enjoy the experience as much as possible
on -PRON- last visit there one of -PRON- salad come incorrectly
-PRON- bring -PRON- to the attention of -PRON- server who promptly apologize and then take -PRON- back to the kitchen to correct the situation
as soon as the waitress seem to disappear the manager come out and make sure that the entire situation be be correct properly
-PRON- must be 100 honest here
-PRON- seem as if every other time -PRON- go out to eat at various restaurant there be a problem in one of -PRON- order
but bad daddy 's definitely set the bar extremely high for how other manager need to handle those problem
who do not love cracker barrel
the country fry chicken country fry steak sweet tea
the white gravy be -PRON- favorite
make the food taste so good
the service be always fast and the food be always good
the country store be always fun to look through and all of the candle smell so good
-PRON- adore roxanne 's
there be so many beautiful arrangement and terrarium and a great variety of live plant inside and out
-PRON- can also find lovely home decor in the form of side table and such
on that note -PRON- have even purchase an ethically make dress here
the employee be always a pleasure to chat with and price be reasonable for the quality -PRON- get
even if -PRON- be not in the market for any of the aforementioned stop in here and fulfill -PRON- sens
only go there for the view
food be crap along with the service
not friendly at all and not helpful with select menu item
for a patio -PRON- would think -PRON- have umbrella like every other patio
drink be very water down and below average
all -PRON- be worth -PRON- for a picture with a bucket and cn tower
-PRON- do not even deserve a star
try to order delivery and after two hour -PRON- never show up
-PRON- say -PRON- driver just do not show up so -PRON- have to cancel and no one know what be go on
horrible experience
this place have really come on in the last year from a couple of random stall beside the grange -PRON- now take up the square opposite the end of hamilton place
while the castle terrace market -PRON- would say meet -PRON- every day shopping need stockbrisge as -PRON- may expect sort out -PRON- specialist item\/upmarket need
run on a thursday evening and on a sunday -PRON- have some fantastic fare
-PRON- top pick would be the veal from peelham farm and the fish\/seafood stall from northumbria
the fish stall be a collection of what come off -PRON- boat the day before so fresh
-PRON- have incredible shellfish include lobster which start at £ 6 and a great selection of fish
for the foodie this be a must visit
jd thinking of new way to eat lobster
drive by this place a few time and decide to just give -PRON- a try since -PRON- hard to find a good bowl of pho in the east end of the city
-PRON- be not very attractive from the outside the decor in the inside be ok but clean
so -PRON- be happy
-PRON- hubby order the pho tai gan and for -PRON- a pho ga
-PRON- both really enjoy -PRON-
-PRON- see in most of the review that people find the broth to be plain but -PRON- think -PRON- be the perfect amount of flavour
-PRON- also have the durian shake -PRON- be stinky and yummy
-PRON- do not cheap on the amount of durian
what -PRON- enjoy most be the spring roll
love how -PRON- put chicken in -PRON-
that s not the norm but very yummy
this be definitely -PRON- new pho spot in the east end
great service
-PRON- hope -PRON- stick around because -PRON- can see how -PRON- can be easily miss
-PRON- definitely need to step up the exterior of -PRON- store
-PRON- be a really big fan of the food here
-PRON- be reasonably price and nice size wrap and bowl
-PRON- be small but quaint
-PRON- be a big fan
the ugly orange monument sign outside should go though
-PRON- just move to the city
and -PRON- decide to try this salon out
the overall vibe of the place be great and everyone seem very nice and welcoming however -PRON- will not be go back
-PRON- be pretty trust with hair stylist and be pretty much open to anything but the lady colour -PRON- hair make -PRON- extremely nervous about -PRON-
-PRON- really be not picky and all -PRON- really want be to lighten -PRON- hair from the red shade -PRON- be
-PRON- have book time for balayage and want to add blonde
but right off the bat -PRON- be tell that the look -PRON- want would be impossible
-PRON- ask for suggestion but -PRON- just be tell how much work -PRON- would be to get the red out of -PRON- hair and that -PRON- be actually a colour correction -PRON- need
-PRON- google picture but everything -PRON- bring up be be shoot down
the colourist seem very unsure about what -PRON- could do to make -PRON- hair light and unsure about what would look good
-PRON- almost feel guilty for want to add blonde to -PRON- hair and -PRON- be very tempt to leave before -PRON- even start
-PRON- do aplogize for how the beginning of the appointment be handle which -PRON- do appreciate but -PRON- should not have be necessary
-PRON- do end up lighten -PRON- balayage hightlight and the colour be ok
but -PRON- do not love -PRON-
and -PRON- do not feel -PRON- be worth the money
on a positive note the lady who cut -PRON- hair be a delight and make -PRON- relax a bit more
regardless when -PRON- get home that day -PRON- be very upset about the whole experience and will not be go back
-PRON- would much rather go to -PRON- old hair salon two hour away
carol houser have be -PRON- nail technician for 12 year that say something about -PRON- expertise
-PRON- be highly skilled and professional but also friendly and courteous
-PRON- salon be private
so -PRON- get one on one attention without all the noise multiple conversation and odor that be find in the strip mall salon
-PRON- technique be current and -PRON- keep updating as the industry do
-PRON- color selection be amazing
finger and toe to perfection
beware this place be the crazy din experience -PRON- will ever have
if -PRON- be a risk taker for dining then this be the place for -PRON-
-PRON- choose 3\/8 meat selection
-PRON- finish everything -PRON- order before the next order can go in
-PRON- order the sirloin steak assume -PRON- would be like every other place and have slice meat cut in small piece
instead -PRON- legitimately give -PRON- whole steak cut from the rump
lol
literally a bunch of crappy 8 10 oz steak
-PRON- literally laugh when that come out because there be no way -PRON- be eat much after
if -PRON- leave food -PRON- be pay per oz\/gram
-PRON- can not remember the amount but -PRON- be incentiviz to take the left over and flush -PRON- down the toilet rather than let -PRON- charge -PRON- for that junk meat
this place should not be in business
the owner be cheap as chip and operate with the mentality of try to make the customer lose
rather most successful business leave -PRON- feel satisfied with the food quality or happy get what -PRON- pay for
-PRON- will feel neither leave this place
food be awesome
the wait be about 20 minute -PRON- give -PRON- coffee and add -PRON- to -PRON- bill
-PRON- ask
the service be why -PRON- give 4 star
-PRON- be super busy
and -PRON- have to ask a few time for refills\/ water
but that be expect with such a crowd
-PRON- love the energy of this place and the atmosphere be positive
ramona be the bad person here
very rude -PRON- even scream at -PRON-
do not care bout customer
very racist
also carolyn -PRON- also make face of customer
-PRON- go to intrigue last week for the first time and book a table through david chanitzer -PRON- hook -PRON- up with a dance floor table and great service
-PRON- good vegas trip ever
where to start who know -PRON- would have 40 + pool table
from the outside the place look small but come to find out -PRON- about 20,000 sq ft
the service be always on point everyone be always friendly
-PRON- favorite part about -PRON- though be -PRON- have rotate craft beer on tap so everytime -PRON- come in there
be bind to be something new
make sure to try julie 's green chili burrito and get -PRON- smother
this place specifically melissa have be amazing
-PRON- be hit in a parking lot then 2 day later someone back into -PRON- son car bad luck week
-PRON- both deal with melissa and -PRON- be a breath of fresh air in a world where customer service be rare
-PRON- be exceptional
-PRON- be great in help deal with the insurance and car rental company
base on -PRON- and also the good work -PRON- do -PRON- would highly recommend this place
thank -PRON- melissa for make a stressful time a little easy
from kristi tony
-PRON- pretty much love the gin kaboom from this place
-PRON- really do taste more like pineapple juice
the reason why this place get a four star instead of 5 be because -PRON- be tell that the entree and appetizer be big enough for 3 4 people
(not really true be more like tapa for one person
maybe -PRON- could be super wrong as well because -PRON- be use to new york portion
but -PRON- be definitely not big enough for 3 4 people with just one order of each
tips order a variety of appetizer and entree and share
this place be definitely victim to the lunchtime rush -PRON- get here at 12:30 and have to wait for a table but by the time -PRON- leave an hour later there be only three other people in the room
food be okay
excellent fry
have the steak which be a bit tough but reasonably so give the price
the room be far too loud when -PRON- be full though
-PRON- be not a soothing pub atmosphere at all more like a train station in rush hour
$ 4 drink make up for a lot of that though
-PRON- recommend hydrocare for carpet clean
-PRON- buy a groupon to try -PRON- out and patrik be on time thorough with the cleaning and make sure -PRON- be happy with the work before leave
-PRON- will definitely call -PRON- again when -PRON- need -PRON- carpet clean again
great place
love the decor the amazing view down the strip and for once a place with reasonable music
-PRON- be here as part of a conference
so -PRON- honestly do not know what the process be to get in otherwise
but if -PRON- be in vegas and look for a great view and a really funky atmosphere this be the place to go
-PRON- be give -PRON- five star because -PRON- be very accommodate upgrade -PRON- to a suite bc -PRON- internet be not work
-PRON- be also during holiday season too when -PRON- be -PRON- busy

-PRON- highly recommend this company the staff here be all courteous and professional -PRON- be also very capable of give good advice and recommendation -PRON- be always there to guide -PRON- through the process and help -PRON- every step of the way
-PRON- help client buy and sell house and -PRON- also help with managing property
-PRON- give -PRON- worry free experience that if -PRON- be out of town or live out of state -PRON- take good care of -PRON- property

-PRON- will definitely be back
not sure what to expect but really pleasantly surprised
locally source food prepare extremely well
great space nice view of the wine cellar or a clever prop
either way maybe that account for why the wine mark up be so truly staggering a good 300 or more over retail completely out of tune with the rest of the food and drink offering
good wine list though
the markup be the only blemish on an otherwise excellent dining experience
overated poutine spot
people like -PRON- because of the hype and most of the time -PRON- drunk and hungry at 4 am and -PRON- one of the only place -PRON- know the party will continue
-PRON- fiancé and -PRON- new to the west side and ice cream junkie

-PRON- never know what car -PRON- will see in there from lambos porsches ferarri 's to camrys accords
-PRON- look like -PRON- handle the tinting for a lot of the local dealership
do not risk go to some sub par outfit
go over to pro tect -PRON- will be glad -PRON- do
-PRON- come to pick up -PRON- car after a service and find -PRON- door to be unlocked and sit in -PRON- dark parking lot
know that -PRON- almost need to leave -PRON- in -PRON- care over night give -PRON- anxiety
-PRON- be quite upset and angry at the lack of respect for -PRON- client property
to recap the job be do and -PRON- car sound good but at the possibility of lose -PRON- car completely -PRON- will be go literally anywhere else
-PRON- too be a fan of delicious deliveries

the lemonade be definitely much improved and some of the food be good
the pull pork be a little greasy but the pork rib be great
-PRON- would be temp to give this place three star but not at a bill of $ 20
for lunch
overpriced be still the good way to describe the joint
luna be perfect for when -PRON- be look for some am sweet\/savory fill up without the commitment of a sit down full service brunch place like the inn on coventry or something like that
a great place to come if -PRON- would like to enjoy a good and healthy than most place breakfast with a couple of friend or just read the paper and enjoy -PRON-
-PRON- almost always get the nutella crepe with banana and strawberry -PRON- be absolutely delicious
on -PRON- most recent visit -PRON- get the oatmeal and be a little disappointed -PRON- have just a tiny scoop of dry fruit and be pretty flavorless and -PRON- have to keep add cinnamon and honey
eventually -PRON- pay 2 extra dollar at the counter for a cup of blueberry strawberry and raspberry and that help a lot just a word of warning
the service be quick and friendly
-PRON- also have delicious cupcakes\/cookies\/etc but -PRON- be usually here in the morning
get there before 10am if -PRON- want to avoid the big crowd
-PRON- and -PRON- friend come here to try the spicy rice cake since -PRON- hear that -PRON- be a really popular place in korea
there be no parking space for the restaurant just street parking but -PRON- be hard to find a parking spot

-PRON- taste like -PRON- be keep in the freezer for century
-PRON- end up eat two bite or so and leave to get real food
do not go here
although -PRON- love dr. shields the office policy greed be ridiculous
-PRON- will make -PRON- come in to see the doctor for everything
-PRON- husband and -PRON- should have a tent outside the building as much as -PRON- go here
-PRON- will not refill prescription or simply call in a simple medicine without an appointment
-PRON- be look for a new place to go asap
bait and switch be right
buyer beware
know -PRON- container size
do not let -PRON- sell -PRON- a 5 gallon in a 3 gallon container
likewise -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- have a 10 gallon which be in a 5 gallon container
-PRON- be like the car salesman of the plant industry
and check -PRON- receipt carefully
this be the real deal
try the hard tacos

the fry chicken be cut into thin strip and there be a lot of -PRON-

the quesadilla taste like -PRON- be heat up in the microwave and not even on a skillet
cheap tasteless tortilla chip come with -PRON-
-PRON- do not try any of the beer on tap but -PRON- do order a mixed drink with watermelon vodka and lemonade
too strong nothing special
-PRON- will never come here again not even if someone else be pay
not worth the horrible food
do not even waste -PRON- time or money
delicious fresh donut
good coffee

queso mean cheese not a bare tortilla
and the guacamole be just chunk of avocado
the drink have more sugar than alcohol and -PRON- be very disrespect by the racist cashier when -PRON- refuse to accept 2 different form of -PRON- international id
both the service and food be below acceptable
-PRON- have be here 4 time and -PRON- be start to become addicted lol
the food be so delicious
if -PRON- be crave meat
this be the place
-PRON- have have the salad the amazing chile verde brisket rib and mac and cheese dish and all cook to perfection with so much flavour
the staff be friendly and attentive
love -PRON-
first off let -PRON- say that -PRON- do not want to rate the shop a one star
after be tattoo for the last six year at divinity tattoo in phoenix -PRON- artist nicole decide to move to massachusetts so -PRON- be on the hunt for a new local artist
-PRON- wife courtesy of facebook find kenzi woods tattoo page on facebook at damaged ink
in chandler
-PRON- wife and -PRON- meet with -PRON- to set up a consultation and give -PRON- a $ 100 cash deposit without receive any kind of receipt or appointment card first red flag
-PRON- have an appointment schedule for two week after that at 4:00 pm when -PRON- show up at about 345 -PRON- inform -PRON- that -PRON- have just take somebody back to do a tattoo second red flag
like many people have post -PRON- do not have a receptionist and -PRON- seem like the artist take the tattoo appointment -PRON- and do not bother to write anything down
after a very painful and heavy handed tattoo session -PRON- leave the shop
-PRON- tattoo heal horribly and the end result be quite a bit of scar on -PRON- arm which be bright red
once the scarring become apparent -PRON- reach out several time to kenzie to discuss with -PRON- that -PRON- be not happy with -PRON- tattoo the way -PRON- heal the scarring because -PRON- go over the area too much and the fact that -PRON- do not like the end result which be quite a bit of scar on -PRON- arm which be bright red
-PRON- reach out several time to kenzie to discuss with -PRON- that -PRON- be not happy with -PRON- tattoo and the fact that -PRON- do not want to have any more work do with -PRON- and want -PRON- deposit back
at the time -PRON- pay -PRON- deposit nobody tell -PRON- that the deposit be nonrefundable
the only way to communicate with kenzie be to con tact -PRON- through facebook messenger as -PRON- do not answer phone call and text at the end of -PRON- conversation with -PRON-
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- be sorry refund be not refundable sorry for the inconvenience and then if -PRON- want to do more work -PRON- would hold -PRON- deposit for 60 day and then -PRON- proceed to block -PRON- on facebook
after let that sink in and let -PRON- anger subside -PRON- reach out to the owner of the shop jason who instruct -PRON- to text -PRON- between the hour of 1 pm at midnight as a tattoo be very late
-PRON- call -PRON- once leave two separate text over a two day period
and then wait a final day to hear back which -PRON- do not please be warn avoid the shop -PRON- tattoo
that be $ 200 and -PRON- up cost -PRON- $ 300 because -PRON- artist refuse to give -PRON- deposit back because -PRON- do not want to do future work with -PRON-
the result be a tattoo -PRON- be not happy with scar on -PRON- arm from -PRON- heavy handedness and overall just pleasure with -PRON- tattoo which be locate on -PRON- forearm for everybody to see
avoid the shop
on other yelp and facebook review -PRON- see the owner reach out to people that leave negative review to comment or ask -PRON- to remove the review so that -PRON- can resolve -PRON- -PRON- have not do any of that which be very surprising
again avoid the shop unless -PRON- want to get rip off for -PRON- deposit
second footnote -PRON- be be about two month and -PRON- have never hear anything from the owner of this tattoo shop show that -PRON- do not care about negative review
avoid
-PRON- be a sucker for all thing disney
especially when -PRON- come to the lion king
one of the main reason that -PRON- want to stay at mandalay be because of this amaze ball show
ticket be normal theater price $ 77 to $ 250
-PRON- get the cheap o seat and -PRON- be not all that bad
the huge beautiful costume be easy to see for everyone and
wow -PRON- manage to design the whole animal kingdom and then some
-PRON- be a truly jaw drop visual feast
the music be equally wonderful
the classic from the disney movie be there as well as a few extra
-PRON- particularly like the adult nala 's solo song about leave pride rock
all of the actor be clearly very well train and very talented
-PRON- can see how kid would love this show but honestly this production be for anyone who want to enjoy a great show in vegas
decent place to get a drink and appetizer after work
-PRON- have be go about once a week for the last several month after work for a couple of beer and light snack
over time the food seem to cook with less care then when -PRON- first start go but -PRON- be still good then average pub food
not as wide a beer selection as some of the large pubs but -PRON- can find something to like
wait
staff be generally attentive but not overly friendly
-PRON- often seem to usually have friend at the bar and spend more time talk to -PRON- then serve
the good experience -PRON- have have at a hair dressing salon
such amazing talented people that make -PRON- look and feel like a million dollar
highly recommend
-PRON- order the egg white avacado breakfast power sandwich
-PRON- be powerfully dry and bland
could benefit nicely from a chipotle mayo or at least some seasoning
the cinnamon scone be coat in granulated sugar
way too sweet and have an off put crunch that grind on the tooth
-PRON- have not be to a paradise cafe in year mainly due to a very bad breakfast bagel sandwich at a different location
now -PRON- be truly defeat
-PRON- use to practice bikram on a semi regular basis needless to say anyone who have be out of practice there be always a little anxiety when restart any yoga practice but especially bikram
so -PRON- drop in on a class expect more of a classical bikram teaching but -PRON- be tell there where bikram element along with flow
so -PRON- have take a class at other hot yoga place that where flow like and never really enjoy the practice
however -PRON- will say that -PRON- honestly love this class and this studio

-PRON- be thrill to discover that -PRON- homemade version werenearly as good as the original
-PRON- would highly recommend this place for any meal
-PRON- be good for a family dinner or a group of friend -PRON- only caveat be that -PRON- should probably make a reservation during peak hour
-PRON- can also be a bit loud so not the place to go if -PRON- be look for a quiet or private experience
let -PRON- begin with how shocked -PRON- be once -PRON- enter the golden nugget
-PRON- do not expect -PRON- to be so nice
a couple of friend
and -PRON- be go out for lunch
-PRON- be early so -PRON- take a stroll around the property and be blow away by how modern and clean everything be
at first -PRON- be apprehensive about the separate dining area
during peak hour cross traffic to get to the part near the pool must be similar to play frogger with a banquet tray
the weather be gorgeous and the pool be beautiful so -PRON- understand why -PRON- seat this area first
as the first party there for lunch -PRON- get a central table near the window
october be pizza month
-PRON- be run a chef 's special for $ 9.99
the special be a basic cherry tomato mozzarella and basil pizza

both pasta also come with an italian salad
-PRON- be be overkill
yet -PRON- be also a death -PRON- be willing to experience again
-PRON- be not a huge fan of cream sauce but -PRON- even take a few bite of the pasta
the lasagna be -PRON- favorite
-PRON- be a bit more saucy than -PRON- normally like but the flavor be good
the pizza be a thin crust style that -PRON- be thankful for because -PRON- could not handle any more carb
by the time all three of -PRON- be finish -PRON- have enough to send someone home with leftover
good place to go if -PRON- have a group which can not decide what type of asian food to eat
service be good
food be typical of an ayce small plate good for a tasting
sushi be tasty however some of the roll be too large
first thing -PRON- be wang 's express not wang express
-PRON- be really picky when -PRON- come to food but -PRON- be not a snob
-PRON- really like this place
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- have be open for about 17 year with the same cook
so -PRON- must be do something right
to other that give this place poor review the food be what -PRON- be fast food even say so on the sign but good for -PRON- than the chain fast food -PRON- will bet
every time -PRON- have eat here the guy at the counter be so very friendly and helpful
the food always come out quick and fresh and taste good than most of the other fast food chinese place around this side of town

gordon ramsay steak be awesome

but not here
the service be great the restaurant be very hip and modern
do not get -PRON- wrong the steak be amazingly good
but -PRON- have steak as good at ruth 's chris
but the good part of the meal be actually the side and homemade breads -PRON- make
and one of the good dessert -PRON- have ever have in -PRON- life be the sticky toffee pudding with brown butter ice cream

5 star for sure
good food and good service
the appetizer calamari be awesome
the fettuccini pasta be a bit dry

-PRON- go here enough that the staff already know what -PRON- be get
not sure if that be a good or bad thing lol
take -PRON- mom for mani\/pedi expect to pay $ 45 but end up pay $ 64
-PRON- be a technician -PRON- and this price be unheard off
-PRON- ask y $ 64 and -PRON- say gel mani be $ 35 and regular pedi be $ 29
either -PRON- get really rip off or -PRON- -PRON- do not understand the menu price -PRON-
on top of that the work be awful

there be a lot of boba place around the valley and the east valley in particular be pretty saturated
when -PRON- hear that there be a new one on dobson -PRON- be not very keen to try -PRON- out after all what could make this place different
-PRON- be easy to mess up boba so -PRON- like to stick the place -PRON- know be good but unfortunately that mean go all the way to san tan mall for -PRON- favourite place
well good thing -PRON- sister be persistent in try this place out
-PRON- drag -PRON- along and -PRON- be pleasantly surprised when -PRON- take a sip of -PRON- drink and chewy sweet boba pop into -PRON- mouth
-PRON- be the perfect consistency and clearly coat in honey give -PRON- a subtlety sweet taste
the tea -PRON- be also very good
the amount of sugar and ice be customizable as well
-PRON- only stop in for the boba and leave since then -PRON- have continue to do the same each time -PRON- come by rather than stay in to hang out
for -PRON- the atmosphere be just okay
-PRON- would like to see more comfortable seating and although the wall with the art be pretty cool -PRON- do not like that -PRON- be on a large sheet of brown paper
-PRON- be just not an aesthetic that -PRON- be fond of
this be a great charity that -PRON- will enjoy participate
anything to do with food -PRON- have -PRON- attention
add value be that -PRON- will be help those who need -PRON- the most
-PRON- will sadly admit -PRON- have only volunteer once for the backpack for kids program
but -PRON- be the sponsor behind restaurant week that happen twice a year
so after attend an yelp event where -PRON- have an assortment of charity that yelp be partner with -PRON- take the time to educate -PRON- with this charity by speak to someone there
with that be say -PRON- have a lot of opportunity for volunteering and have fun at the same time
-PRON- next visit to -PRON- will be to help pack dinner for kid and that would mean -PRON- get to be in -PRON- kitchen
-PRON- have walk by -PRON- kitchen and see the operation

this hotel be really beautiful and worth the money spend for a mini getaway
-PRON- will be come back here again on -PRON- next stay
-PRON- stop by after read some great review
but also because -PRON- be one of the few healthy juice and smoothie place in north scottsdale which be kind of odd right
-PRON- spend most of -PRON- time on the east coast where juice place be on every corner and real juice like the green stuff be sell in store
so -PRON- be easy to get
the menu at grabba green be robust good selection
maybe a little overwhelming for a first timer but whatevs -PRON- can def get what -PRON- need
-PRON- order 3 smoothie here the thing -PRON- be so ice cold -PRON- could hardly taste the actual fruit and veg in -PRON-
ice cold
so either the ice weigh out the ingredient in the smoothie or the ingredient be very cold too cold
either way not a lot of taste
that be a shame
and at 11:20am -PRON- be already out of wheatgrass
-PRON- be monday people
-PRON- may try -PRON- again but would probably trek over to try the new true food juice add on instead
unique flavor in a funky location
be sure to sit on the patio
the salsa and chip be okay
salsa be more of a relish with corn tomato etc
-PRON- be not very juicy
-PRON- order the queso and -PRON- be a little thick for -PRON- liking
the taco have great flavor
-PRON- be not a fan of the fry flour tortilla with -PRON-
-PRON- would prefer just a fresh tortilla
-PRON- be not impressed with -PRON- side a rice with a mango salsa on top
-PRON- husband be also not too impressed with -PRON- garlic and jalapeño mash potato
definitely try the wahoo taco
great service
would go back for the people and the atmosphere

so there be a starbucks across the street -PRON- hang out at once if -PRON- would know about this place -PRON- would have walk across the parking lot
this place have a much mellower vibe than starbucks
-PRON- do not come to this place to be see just to hang out and chill and not obsess with the brand of -PRON- coffee
that say the barista here seem way too artificially blissful like a stepford wife or something
-PRON- should have ask -PRON- to put a little of what -PRON- be have into -PRON- drink
go to the bathroom here be fun -PRON- sort of go through a maze that take -PRON- past the kitchen and into the back area of the store
well keep up bathroom

this be a hefty portion and be enough for two meal for most people
the sauce be amazing

product one of the good meat quality in the vegas area variety of selection that can not be get in other restaurant
-PRON- be also very clean unlike other place around
service
-PRON- be only good if -PRON- speak korean or sit in the same table with a person that speak korea but i guess -PRON- be a common theme in all korean restaurant around vegas
price
a little high compare to other but i would pay -PRON- for the quality of the product
overall if -PRON- can live with the poor service of a typical korean restaurant i would strongly recommend go there for the quality of the meat
good stuff
-PRON- be in town for a couple day on business and decide to try soho
-PRON- boss and -PRON- stop in on a tuesday to grab a bite to eat and have a drink or three

hmmmmm dusit
-PRON- leave -PRON- confuddl
-PRON- like -PRON- be go to be great the menu confirm this the wine draw -PRON- in further and then the food and the service be somehow just lack a little bit
not the most constructive feedback -PRON- know
but -PRON- do not really feel much more about -PRON- that this -PRON- ok not bad but not great
a pro con review of
as -PRON- grow 's 2x per year consignment sale 03\/23 to 03\/25\/12
pros
1 -PRON- pack 80,000 sq ft with kid stuff and most of -PRON- be reasonably price

-PRON- be not bias towards more girl stuff as -PRON- have see in other place
3

volunteer get first crack at the good stuff
yes that be a perk for volunteering but still
-PRON- be be pick over
2 pricing
while -PRON- find a few good thing in here at reasonable price some item be ridiculous
a bit of advice to the seller just because -PRON- say gap or childrens place on the tag do not mean -PRON- can charge full price or maybe $ 2 less than full price for the item
3
hole and stain
whomever check the clothe miss quite a few hole and stain in the stuff -PRON- look at
make sure -PRON- inspect -PRON- clothe before -PRON- purchase -PRON-

next go on a friday if -PRON- can saturday if -PRON- have no other choice
by sunday quite a bit of what be leave be barely fit to pack up and send overseas or to recycle
but most of what be leave be mark down to 50 off price reduction be take at the register
also -PRON- do take mastercard and visa as well as cash
if -PRON- be a parent in vegas this event be one that be worth -PRON- time
-PRON- like this place but admittedly -PRON- usually wait for sale
-PRON- be a bit pricey
the quality of shoe and clothe be great and the customer care be even good
th store be fill with natural light and -PRON- be welcome
upstairs in the woman 's clothing section -PRON- be not really all that impressed and the price tag for the average item be wayyyy overprice
-PRON- come here for shoe
the customer service be great
oh -PRON- be so ashamed -PRON- take -PRON- so long to visit this establishment but to make up for lose time -PRON- keep visit frequently
-PRON- love that -PRON- have a punch card because who do not love a free sandwich every now and again
the sandwich here be delectable
-PRON- have already decide that -PRON- have to try every single sandwich before -PRON- can pick -PRON- favorite
some people like to complain about the price of the sandwich but these sandwich be huge and jam pack with deliciousness
-PRON- be so happy this be a mid way stop from work to where -PRON- volunteer very convenient

-PRON- go with a group of 8 friend and -PRON- conquer the pearled pachyderm with 11 minute to spare

bar tender name amanda strengthen -PRON- up for -PRON- because -PRON- can not have too much sugar
-PRON- waitress danielle be very efficient and nice
-PRON- get the fish and the ground beef taco which be both amazing
the only thing -PRON- do not like be the chair outside be uncomfortable
great place for taco and marg on a sunny day
dress
casual
-PRON- have a sport coat on and end up take -PRON- off and roll sleeve up
very casual place can prob even get away with short
this be exactly what -PRON- think of when -PRON- think italian

do not miss this place when -PRON- go to vegas
everything about this place be on point
-PRON- sit at the bar and john be -PRON- bartender -PRON- have steak lobster and crab and avocado salad and all 3 item be phenomenal

-PRON- be nervous go in because -PRON- be the first time -PRON- schedule an appointment and go in by -PRON- but -PRON- give -PRON- a warm welcome and that make everything a lot better
-PRON- would highly recommend go here
these knuckle drag sub human like to call -PRON- after -PRON- be dumb enough to use -PRON- service every month or so for year after
even if -PRON- tell -PRON- to take -PRON- off -PRON- call list -PRON- obviously do not and -PRON- will receive call indefinitely
there be lot of other option out there with any kind of decent business practice
stay away if -PRON- be smart
this nightclub have be -PRON- first nightclub
i have ever go to in las vegas
and -PRON- have to say the vibe for this entire nightclub be amazing
the club be two story with bottle service and gogo girl dance on the pole
the light in the club be absolutely outstanding
the light be not too dark or too bright
just about right for an outside setting
-PRON- just turn 21 year old not too long ago about the end of last year
and -PRON- feel like -PRON- be in the correct nightclub
not one of those nightclub where the old mid 30s-40s be try to hit on the cougar
definitely not this club
-PRON- feel awesome be here
-PRON- be expensive for guy to get in but be at the club until 4 a.m. be worth every single dollar even when drink be 8 15 dollar
-PRON- will definitely be come back to this nightclub again for -PRON- next las vegas trip
update
this location be now permanently
close down
nearest caribou be at foxcroft

this place be down the block from -PRON- -PRON- buy -PRON- traveller blend -PRON- make terrific espresso and the kid work here be great
soooooooo good
but -PRON- get very packed get there early
-PRON- have an early dinner here
-PRON- order the scallop w vanilla bean sauce and the pork chop and french fry
the scallop be excellent and -PRON- be tell -PRON- be -PRON- most popular dish
the pork chop be also very delicious
the fry be good but could have be good as far as season
-PRON- sit on the patio -PRON- be a very nice atmosphere and the service be excellent
-PRON- will likely be back
-PRON- new favorite restaurant in vegas
such a gem and a great discovery
patio atmosphere be casual and lovely
cocktail be awesome
-PRON- share the ceviche goat cheese fondue peach and burrata salad wing and the duck pot pie and all be delicious
one of the good experience -PRON- have have in a long time
go here
unfortunately -PRON- menu list item -PRON- never have intend to have
as in the bulgogi korean bbq- 0 for 3 and a strike out as far as -PRON- be concern
simply perfect
small authentic place with warm service
the food be amazing
can not wait to go back and try all everything
-PRON- be close when -PRON- go here
-PRON- really want to eat here
but -PRON- have to make other plan
-PRON- will update this review past the obvious
be close from 3:30 to 5:00 pm be strange
usually in n out burger be one of the first place -PRON- visit when -PRON- come to la and so -PRON- be pleasantly surprised that there be location here in phoenix
as a houstonian -PRON- be unfortunately deprive of such a place
definitely a must visit for any burger enthusiast and -PRON- fry be out of this world
yeah this place be a friggin joke -PRON- live hear here and -PRON- be nasty the pool be green and smell like sulfar there be use lime on the pool deck with other food item strewen throw out the pool area -PRON- room be dusty and the bathroom shower curtain be moldy
-PRON- guess there be no expense spair or mybe
every exspense be speair because -PRON- shure be not here
0.0 star
-PRON- be give this two star only because the complex -PRON- be self be beautiful
the land scape be always keep up on and the pool area be always clean
now to dive into why -PRON- only receive 2 star
-PRON- be rent will always be inconsistent
when -PRON- sign a lease agreement here -PRON- be show that -PRON- would be pay anywhere from $ 780-$800 a month base on power usage
-PRON- have live in this complex for three year and should have move prior to this one after continuously be bent over
but new management be go to make a difference
so -PRON- choose to give -PRON- another shot
-PRON- most recent 2 rent bill have be over $ 1000
-PRON- cover this up with fee
-PRON- have not use an absurd amount of power or water either
-PRON- apartment be keep at 78 degree
fahrenheit -PRON- be rare that the a\/c kick on
another thing to note prior to move in be all of -PRON- potential issue have to be deal with by a manager and every time -PRON- walk in -PRON- will receive a -PRON- be not in right now here be -PRON- email
on top of that -PRON- never respond to -PRON- email
if -PRON- a college student a piece of advise be to check out west 6 and salt if -PRON- do not mind pay out the ass for a place to live
-PRON- first year here be excellent with the prior management but as soon as -PRON- leave everything go down hill
last thing about this complex -PRON- only offer 12 month lease agreement over the summer -PRON- leave to work in washington and -PRON- be not even stay in -PRON- apartment
-PRON- make sure everything be off and somehow -PRON- rent over the summer be consistently $ 1100
-PRON- call and be tell -PRON- be power usage
however nothing be on because no one be live there
do not give these people
-PRON- be money there be many good option in this area some be nice and less $ $
-PRON- be just yelp for the free desert just kid fast service all the fixing and the food be amazing

-PRON- would definitely go back
-PRON- be not all that great

restaurant update
-PRON- never have a chance to write about -PRON- 3 experience here which will be the last
-PRON- have enjoy all -PRON- visit up until this last trip a few month ago which leave a very sour taste in -PRON- mouth
-PRON- newly introduce a child 's menu which on the top of the menu state include a child 's drink
-PRON- have -PRON- prime rib dinner for two which be great
-PRON- son try the mac and cheese which be okay for 3.49 what could -PRON- ask for along with a cup of milk
when -PRON- receive the check -PRON- charge -PRON- for the milk which -PRON- think be a mistake
when -PRON- speak with the waitress -PRON- argue that yes -PRON- be include but -PRON- have to pay for -PRON-
this be simply crazy how can something be include and yet -PRON- get charge for -PRON-
-PRON- tell -PRON- to go talk to the manager
after 5 minute -PRON- come back and tell -PRON- that the manager would take -PRON- off this time
-PRON- be irate that somehow the manager do not understand how a child 's menu work
somehow -PRON- make -PRON- feel like a criminal try to get out of pay for -PRON- kid 's drink
when -PRON- be leave -PRON- ask another waitress do -PRON- routinely charge for kid 's drink
and -PRON- say -PRON- do not know
and in -PRON- anger -PRON- decide to ask for the manager
-PRON- come over and tell -PRON- hopefully that do not ruin the meal but the staff need to be better educate
at no time do -PRON- apologize for -PRON- own misunderstanding of the kid 's menu or clarify whether kid 's drink be include or not include
-PRON- end up write a letter to complain to corporate to re educate and to not rip off other customer when -PRON- order the kid 's menu item
-PRON- get a phone call tell -PRON- sorry but due to the poor handling with the initial experience -PRON- be do with o'charley 's
nice gym do not know if -PRON- will like this place on squat day because of the stair
-PRON- find that -PRON- will be in this area at least once a week
so what good to have access to than a nice gym
parking be plentiful
the front desk be nice and the employee friendly
easy check in and to the locker room -PRON- go
the locker room be nice and the locker be big enough to hold -PRON- stuff
the shower have individual stall
-PRON- like that because -PRON- do not feel like -PRON- be shower in prison like -PRON- do at the other gym
-PRON- go to
easy to clean -PRON- ass as -PRON- do not feel eye on -PRON-
a small walk upstairs which will be a problem on leg day
-PRON- usually give -PRON- leg a beating on those day but -PRON- will make -PRON- part of -PRON- work out
not really a problem
the cardio area be set up well and easy to walk around
the free weight area be the usual for all of the 24 's
a good selection of db 's and bench
so -PRON- do not foresee any problem come to this gym
so -PRON- give -PRON- a thumb up
after -PRON- third attempt for dinner at house brasserie the hubs
and -PRON- finally complete -PRON- mission for date night at the new spot this past saturday
-PRON- call the night before and be fortunate enough to get -PRON- very last reservation for the night at the high top table in the bar
as -PRON- wonderful waitress inform -PRON- -PRON- be sit at the good table in the house and -PRON- can confidently say -PRON- agree
parking be a bit tricky but once -PRON- walk in -PRON- be more than pleasantly surprised
the restaurant -PRON- be very romantic with great lighting and interesting decor especially in the bar area
-PRON- waitress take the time to tell -PRON- about the amazing house that be now the restaurant and -PRON- make -PRON- appreciate the experience that much more
as far as the food\/drink go this place be not cheap by any mean
the price be worth -PRON- though for the most part
-PRON- have the watermelon cooler which be refreshing and interesting
-PRON- would probably try something else next time but all in all -PRON- be good
the good thing -PRON- eat be the brisket and biscuit and the goat cheese cheesecake
holy smokes
those two thing be close -PRON- eye and have a moment good even three day later -PRON- be still think about -PRON-
a must for sure
the big miss -PRON- have be the shrimp with sweet corn
just do not taste too great and -PRON- be not anything special like the brisket and cheesecake
-PRON- share the lamb pasta and duck confit meatball
-PRON- feel like these be pretty good but do not blow -PRON- away like the previously mention item
so thankful -PRON- finally make -PRON- to house
-PRON- love the mission and be equally pleased with house
the service be fab as be the food so in -PRON- humble opinion this spot be a homerun
this place if just ok
a little pricey -PRON- drink be good but service be slow
the decor be a mix between -PRON- grandma house and a coffee shop which be weird
nothing make -PRON- want to go back though
good luck guy
excellent place to stop by for a quick eat
after pay $ 30 + for buffet -PRON- come here and pay $ 8 and get a full steamy meal
-PRON- be quite amazing how cheap and quick -PRON- can please -PRON- stomach
the place be quite noisy with a lot of kids\/familie eat here
definitely not a place to impress -PRON- date but if -PRON- be by -PRON- and be in a rush -PRON- be one of -PRON- top choice
fake chinese food
do not order any noodle dim sun and desert
the ice water be the only thing -PRON- like
overview
-PRON- go back and forth debate if -PRON- want to spend the money at gr steak and figure -PRON- would check this off -PRON- food bucketlist
although service be amazing -PRON- be pretty pricey and the food be good but not mind shatter
come out to a lil over $ 250 w\/tip for the two of -PRON-
would come back only for the dessert
location
inside the paris casino
-PRON- have a huge gordan ramsay steak sign so -PRON- can not miss -PRON-
if -PRON- be walk in from the bally 's walkway -PRON- be to the right once -PRON- hit the casino
if -PRON- be come in from the eiffel tower entrance from the strip walk all the way to the back of the casino
and -PRON- be on -PRON- left
reservation
-PRON- book on thurs at 10 p.m.
-PRON- get there a little early around 9:30 to see if -PRON- could get -PRON- in and be tell the table will be ready at 10 p.m.
but -PRON- be welcome to stay at the bar
no biggie
-PRON- decide to walk around and gamble a bit and come back at 10 p.m.
seating once -PRON- get in -PRON- hostess tell -PRON- the light above mimic gordan 's hand movement as -PRON- make the beef wellington
cool
the lighting explain why most of the photo on yelp suck
the red light give everything a dark red color to photo but use flash be too bright and distracting
service
amazing
when -PRON- make the reservation -PRON- make a comment -PRON- be -PRON- bday and everyone from the hostess to -PRON- waiter all wish -PRON- a happy bday no freebie but still nice
great that -PRON- actually read those comment
both -PRON- bf and -PRON- be kind of fish out of water a bit awk because -PRON- normally do not go to fancy restaurant
-PRON- be a bit overwhelming for -PRON- because -PRON- seem like -PRON- have a couple server
but the waiter be not snooty at all and nice
head up -PRON- will come by and wipe down the table to keep -PRON- clean between each food course
-PRON- think -PRON- be just super messy
but -PRON- seem to do that to most table
also just like on hell 's kitchen -PRON- serve -PRON- entree and side dish all at the same time
this be why -PRON- have multiple server so -PRON- could have two people serve at the same exact time
food
bread comp bread
sadly -PRON- be not as in love with the bread as -PRON- fellow yelper
there be variety of diff kind and -PRON- actually do not finish -PRON-
the butter be actually kind of hard
so -PRON- be difficult to spread
drinks hk antioxidant
-PRON- be good very refreshing
appetizer half dozen oyster
these come 3 diff type 2 of each kind pre season 2 type be east coast and 1 be west coast
-PRON- be the first time -PRON- have oyster and -PRON- be so good
-PRON- also come with a tiny bottle of tabasco and side sauce
omg
-PRON- be so good and fresh
main course beef wellington for 1
-PRON- be confuse on yelp by the photo some show 1 piece and other show 2 piece
-PRON- do come with 2 piece
-PRON- give one to -PRON- bf and -PRON- give -PRON- half of -PRON- american rib cap
the beef wellington be honestly a bit clumsy to eat but the beef be so tender juicy and perfectly medium rare
-PRON- personally think the meat -PRON- be a little under season but -PRON- be pretty good
the puff pastry on top be perfect
the potato puree be more just a decoration literally a couple of bite if -PRON- scrape -PRON- together
vegetable be ok -PRON- be strangely sweet and just a couple bite as well
american rib cap- just come as be
-PRON- be both a bit disappointed as -PRON- be tough than -PRON- both have think
-PRON- be ok but nothing amazing
-PRON- both prefer the wellington side mac cheese
there be so many rave review about this mac cheese on yelp but neither of -PRON- like -PRON-
-PRON- be bit cold when -PRON- get -PRON-
and -PRON- be too dense and flavor do not go well w\/our meat
dessert sticky toffee
pudding- do not miss out
this dessert -PRON- deserve a 5 star
-PRON- be worried about -PRON- be a date cake but do not take like -PRON-
perfect sweetness w\/the icecream together
perfect dessert to share for 2 tip and such
the wellington do take about 45 min and -PRON- will time all the food to get to -PRON- table at the same time so unfortunately everyone else will wait on -PRON-
-PRON- be not too bad since -PRON- will get bread but plan on get an app too
-PRON- have a total rewards pricing so make sure -PRON- to bring -PRON- card
-PRON- be not stay at paris but -PRON- look like -PRON- could charge to -PRON- room if -PRON- be
if -PRON- do not have a tr card get one for free at any tr hotel bally 's and paris both have a counter

-PRON- all love -PRON-
tonight -PRON- waiter be charley
-PRON- be fun and attentive
-PRON- be so full after share salad that -PRON- have no room for artichoke lasagna
charley feed -PRON- one bite just to make sure -PRON- taste
what a hoot
and of course the lasagna and the calzone be yummy
the flavor in the thin crust pesto pizza -PRON- have on a previous visit be also delicious but maybe could have be cook a bit longer
august 11 -PRON- just have to say -PRON- again
-PRON- love this place
-PRON- pop in around 2:00 for another one of those fabulous grey hounds make by carrie the bar tender
ok -PRON- have 2 but -PRON- be hard to stop there
carrie be great
-PRON- be an employee that oregano be lucky to have
so thankful -PRON- live within a few block
so -PRON- can stop in regularly for a quick drink great service fun conversation and perfect atmosphere
very good boba on -PRON- side of town
-PRON- use to go to tea station just for good boba but ever since qq boba open -PRON- do not have to drive so far
ice milk drink with caramel pudding honey boba be -PRON- favorite
the staff\/ husband wife that work here be very friendly help -PRON- choose the perfect drink
this place be two thumb up in -PRON- book
-PRON- order the beacon cheese fry for the first time there
ok -PRON- be not really a big fan of the cheese -PRON- use but -PRON- must say -PRON- pink lemonade be delicious and -PRON- also very efficient
-PRON- eat there tonight with -PRON- mother in law and wife
-PRON- have be here several time and the food be great
the service be good and -PRON- enjoy the decor of the restaurant
-PRON- do not look like much from the outside however when -PRON- step inside -PRON- can see all the work the owner have do inside
-PRON- definitely pay off since one of the reason -PRON- enjoy this restaurant be the atmosphere and artwork on the wall
-PRON- food be top notch with -PRON- favorite be -PRON- egg drop soup and -PRON- fried tofu with veggie
be a rip off
the teacher be not on par with yoga instructor elsewhere
-PRON- be not even remotely fit
the class get cancel willy nilly without announcement
-PRON- student be people who do not know better
-PRON- be downgrade a star due to -PRON- horrible experience at the pharmacy
mind
-PRON-
this be the main reason -PRON- go here
the woman behind the counter be standoffish and snotty
when -PRON- go to pick up -PRON- prescription -PRON- state there be an issue with -PRON- insurance
-PRON- understand this likely be not -PRON- fault
however no phone call to -PRON-
beforehand
so -PRON- waste time drive down there
when -PRON- inquire for further info the woman behind the counter say not to blame -PRON- and point at the gentleman dispense the medication
-PRON- be not blame anyone but generally all the pharmacy -PRON- have deal with try to contact the insurance co on file if there be an issue
within a minute the woman essentially push -PRON- aside and grab the next person
-PRON- get -PRON- busy but no one could take a moment to inform -PRON- what be go on
-PRON- do get a call three or four hour later from the dispenser to call -PRON- insurance co.
well duh that be -PRON- plan
-PRON- will not go here again for medication and will only shop here if -PRON- need something at a discount that -PRON- can not find anywhere else
not worth the poor service and rough area
-PRON- have be go to this location for a few year now and even though -PRON- move to the other side of town -PRON- always find -PRON- back here to see michael especially after -PRON- help -PRON- back heal up after a minor fender bender
michael definitely know how the muscle work and how to break up knot with really deep tissue massage that miraculously do not leave -PRON- cringe in pain
-PRON- get huge knot in -PRON- shoulder and have tweak -PRON- back before and nothing seem to help like one of these massage
-PRON- like the relaxation room at this location because -PRON- be a lot quieter
block out the lobby noise better than some of the other and -PRON- be dimly light which help -PRON- start to wind down and relax
-PRON- have see another location use lot of hot towel during regular massage so that be the only thing -PRON- wish this location do because -PRON- tend to get cold even with the table heater on but -PRON- guess the deep muscle add on get -PRON- that
-PRON- have such high hope for the rnr half marathon in vegas but unfortunately -PRON- be sadly disappoint
where do -PRON- begin
the race shirt be small a medium be more like a small and no exchange be permit until after the race
the race -PRON- would have be nice to have shuttle to the race from the major hotel venetian palazzo bellagio etc
however no this be not the case taxi -PRON- be
so -PRON- arrive in -PRON- corrale and expect to be run at the pace that -PRON- plan however due to the walker -PRON- run considerably slow than -PRON- expect
there be no courtesy give to the fellow runner people walk at mile 1
-PRON- be great that -PRON- decide to do -PRON- first half marathon but some of -PRON- be train for month for the move to the right if -PRON- be go to walk and there should never ever be walk and hand holding stretch across the road
that be just insane
walkers in the future do -PRON- and -PRON- fellow runner a favor stay to the right
the finish line well where do -PRON- start
mass disorganization take -PRON- picture then attempt to locate the gear check no one to ask no sign until close to the gear check
and the allege shuttle could not find -PRON- anywhere again ask several runner and see no race official to ask either -PRON- relentlessly wait for a cab for 2 hour
so let -PRON- recap follow the race
-PRON- be tired cold sweaty hungry and exhausted and have to wait for a cab for two hour
why the long wait -PRON- ask the road be shut down for the race no traffic be move due to the closure
-PRON- agree with the other comment regard this race limit the number to 28,000 and execute a good plan of preparation
-PRON- would strongly suggest additional race personnel for inquiry follow the race
-PRON- be on the fence if -PRON- would do this race in vegas again
-PRON- have already sign up for the phoenix race
so -PRON- hope -PRON- be better organize
if -PRON- be not -PRON- will not be partake of the rnr half in washington dc and will also discourage -PRON- friend from do the race as well

when -PRON- visit -PRON- be cash pay and do not have insurance coverage yet
-PRON- give -PRON- inaccurate price quote and continue to bill -PRON- for either service not do or service already pay for
-PRON- order unnecessary test and a 3d ultrasound when -PRON- be about 5 week pregnant
-PRON- feel as though the ultrasound tech be rude and health provider incompetent
-PRON- see -PRON- twice before seek other care
when -PRON- proceed to have -PRON- medical record send to the new provider -PRON- take almost 2 week to do so and the staff be rude and unhelpful to -PRON- husband and i.
-PRON- tell every pregnant woman -PRON- struggle with momdoc so -PRON- can avoid the same nightmarish experience -PRON- have
great food
-PRON- bring -PRON- one year old food out earlier than -PRON-
also -PRON- love the accordion and -PRON- play for -PRON- son a lot which keep -PRON- entertain
-PRON- have chicken piccata and -PRON- be delicious
-PRON- daughter and -PRON- go in to 7 day on saturday morning at 9:30 am the salon be already full good sign
although the salon be full -PRON- do not make -PRON- wait more than 10 minute for -PRON- two pedicure
spa chair be nice selection of three different price pedicure and a good selection of polish
what more can a girl ask for
highly recommend
discover this restaurant on a wednesday evening not expect too much of a crowd but come to find -PRON- pack before during and after -PRON- dinner
there be a slight wait
but -PRON- keep thing move quickly
the pork belly steam bun be to die for an absolute foodgasm
the short rib be a must absolutely amazing as well
the sauce have a kick to -PRON- but with molass like sweetness
great wine as well do not be afraid to order by the glass the menu only show price by the bottle
definitely a must stop in montreal
good food nothing wow factor but good
miserable a\/c and -PRON- be so hot at 9 a.m. -PRON- could not enjoy -PRON- breakfast without sweat
visit this place on a saturday midnight
the line reach the street
debate whether -PRON- be smart to wait in the line- good decision ever
by the time -PRON- pick what -PRON- want -PRON- would be approach to order
there be so many crazy option of meat
taco de adobada aka spicy pork with everything be amazing
the meat be shave off a sharwarma grill assemble right in front of -PRON-
be disappoint
-PRON- order only 2 taco -PRON- be pretty small like the mexican street taco
the tamarind horchata drink be sweet and tangy in just the right amount
the cinnamon horchata taste like a iced apple cider with a twist
-PRON- definite go to place in vegas
can not wait to return and get a large order of these amazing taco
5 star for the cheap price and the tastiness
this dunkin be just not consistent
the wait time be usually 10 15 min in the morning which -PRON- be sure be one of the busy time and most of the staff just be not happy to see -PRON- or even be work
-PRON- be rare when -PRON- get a have a good day or thank for come in when -PRON- leave which -PRON- have work in customer service and that s important
this be the only dunkin on -PRON- way to work
and -PRON- use to go every weekday
now -PRON- go once a week
and -PRON- only order 1 drink and at least half of the time -PRON- not correct
-PRON- get hard to go there since -PRON- wait so long and -PRON- a 50 chance -PRON- order will not be correct
if -PRON- decide to go to this dunkin make sure to go inside and make sure -PRON- order be correct before leave
and make sure -PRON- have an extra 10 15 min to spare
should have know in the beginning when the dt location refer -PRON- to the edgewood location and edgewood location back to dt location -PRON- experience be go to be terrible
they forgot my dressing
2 salad and no dressing
this be delivery too
so -PRON- be up on mt troy
-PRON- call in to complain and all -PRON- do be pass the phone around to the cook and mgr and whoever else
after that -PRON- do not matter if the sandwich be the good -PRON- ever have -PRON- do not enjoy -PRON-
and -PRON- tip the guy over $ 15
-PRON- feel like -PRON- get rip off
people make mistake -PRON- get -PRON-
but -PRON- feel -PRON- just get rob
let -PRON- see if -PRON- make -PRON- right
and -PRON- will delete this review or update -PRON- with how -PRON- totally come through and care
-PRON- be on -PRON- guy
during a 2 + hour layover in phx -PRON- be head to la madeleine to get soup for the wife when -PRON- see the french onion soup on the menu here
since -PRON- can do la mad back home -PRON- say what the heck and stop in to zinc
now as everyone know french onion soup be general serve with a crouton on top on which the cheese melt
but if -PRON- be gluten free like the wife -PRON- will just melt the gruyère cheese right on the top of the soup fill crock
even though -PRON- would probably have be more fun to be able to have the cheese on toast bread on top poor wife -PRON- be pleased with the soup
and speaking of gruyère
the truffl gruyère zinc burger be as amazing as -PRON- look
five star right there
the dessert -PRON- choose be some sort of chocolate bread pudding\/cake situation with a side of ice cream with house make caramel sauce on top
eh fairly forgettable -PRON- do not finish -PRON- even splitting -PRON- between the two of -PRON-
well wife could only have the ice cream
maybe pastry be not -PRON- strong suit
overall -PRON- be pricy because of the airport premium and -PRON- be try a bit too hard to be a bistro which for some reason make people think -PRON- should charge 10 more
and -PRON- do not have to wait very long for -PRON- food which be necessary in an airport
-PRON- be pretty happy with -PRON- burger frite and beer and there be plug available between the table to top off the device
3.86 star
which for an airport dining stop be pretty darn good
great choice of gourmet hot dog great customer service
staff be very nice and friendly
-PRON- favorite hot dog be the mexicano -PRON- a bacon wrap with fresh avocado on top
there be also have delicious colombian empanada that -PRON- can enjoy the food while -PRON- drink a cold refreshing draft beer
definitely recommend this place
what a delightful dinner
-PRON- need first note that if -PRON- plan to dine with child -PRON- may only do so on the terrace which be lovely and must be seat before 6 pm as -PRON- must be finish and depart by 8 pm per -PRON- bar license
ok to the review
eat here
-PRON- be fantastic
one of the good meal -PRON- have have in a long time
the menu be creative and the service outstanding
the grilled lamb fillet tzatziki cauliflower tabbouleh be perfectly cook and the cauliflower tabbouleh such a creative non grain side
the mediterranean chicken plate think a chicken greek salad but so much more be the perfect dish for a warm night on the terrace
-PRON- believe -PRON- must poach the chicken before finish on the grill because -PRON- be much to moist to have be fully grill
the salad be canadian style of course with lot of veggie rather than american style with lot of lettuce and a creamy feta dressing round -PRON- off
the tagliatelle with napolitan sauce be light and delicious
-PRON- must save room for dessert
skip the white chocolate and fresh rasberrie nem ice cream which be a 1\/2 cigar sized spring roll fill with white chocolate and raspberry ok
but nothing special
however -PRON- will be glad -PRON- order the cheese ice cream guava sauce -PRON- be amazing
the ice cream be make with fontina cheese but taste and texture wise maybe mascarpone
the guava sauce give a fruit tangy contrast wow
and make sure -PRON- try one of -PRON- snazzy cocktail -PRON- particularly enjoy the mojito boris
this be a very happen place lot of local so if -PRON- can make a reservation
-PRON- latte be completely undrinkable
taste like a burn mess
son always get a fresh cut when come here
the wait be usually long but -PRON- think -PRON- be worth the wait
to start this catering company have great bbq
-PRON- have hear about this company from a friend of -PRON- and decide to try -PRON-
-PRON- be pleasantly surprised and will be ordr from this catering company in the future
the brisket be very tender with the fat at the top add a really nice texture to the meat
the baked bean be great of course and -PRON- would order the mac n cheese again
can not wait to try the pull pork bbq with -PRON- texas and carolina sauce next
ps
even though there be an address list for this place this be a catering company and the owner may have a different location for pick up than what be list
good store good service
-PRON- be a bit biased since -PRON- live right around the corner but -PRON- still think -PRON- a great shop
very mom n'pop esque with shelf shove full of everything -PRON- can imagine-- would be very difficult to navigate be -PRON- not for the helpful staff who can show -PRON- around
selection be not quite home depot size in term of the multiplicity of brand of the same item but -PRON- can typically find what -PRON- need
hour be good too-- -PRON- find -PRON- in the middle of a motorcycle project need something urgently fairly often and can always find -PRON- here
-PRON- fuck love -PRON- intelligence
thank
definitely refer if ever hopefully never
-PRON- need u
-PRON- will b there clever ahahaha lame but fr u guy r litttty much respect for how fast accurate u guy r
thank again
u guy
r amazing hopefully -PRON- day exceed that
yuck
sorry
-PRON- know this be the beloved hot spot for many yelper
but -PRON- just be not feelin
-PRON- and -PRON- for darn sure do not see the hype
-PRON- could not really get past the fact that the place be such a dump
-PRON- get the whole dive thing
but this be straight up grimy
-PRON- be surprised -PRON- do not see any roach during -PRON- stay
but the atmosphere be one that would certainly encourage such a visitor
the service be decent not friendly but somewhat efficient -PRON- suppose
the food be just not -PRON- thing
maybe -PRON- do not like authentic korean but even the shrimp fry rice be gross
the bbq be bland and there be nothing else -PRON- try that be memorable
-PRON- realize -PRON- be not an expert when -PRON- come to korean food
but if this be the good charlotte have to offer then either charlotte need more korean restaurant or -PRON- can confidently say -PRON- do not enjoy korean food
either way -PRON- would not come back here
this be such a nice park but there be so many off leash dog have to have see at least 10 on a thursday evening from 5:30pm 6:30pm that -PRON- make -PRON- hard to enjoy
some of -PRON- be under voice control but still there be a dog park down the street on warm springs if -PRON- want to have -PRON- dog off leash so -PRON- leashed dog can enjoy walk here
try the cinnamon sugar cookie which be buttery and with a nice topping of spice and sweetness
the buy three get one free option be tempting but -PRON- settle for the one cookie and a water
cashier be friendly and efficient
this store now share space with a boba place so there be probably some interesting combination to be make
probably the good korean food -PRON- can find in charlotte area do not get confused about the name -PRON- be korean not a chinese
so -PRON- will go with korean menu
be to korea so many time
plus -PRON- personally a big fan of korean food
this place get the job do well
-PRON- can request authentic flavor mean less sweet more spicy -PRON- will accommodate -PRON- very well
one star off for location not the nice neighborhood -PRON- want to be in
environment the place deserve a nice make over price a bit of overprice compare to nyc or boston but -PRON- guess -PRON- do not quite have a choice for live in charlotte

beers- in house and regional
dragoon be -PRON- favorite house brew
-PRON- can not say -PRON- have be to a lot of these type of store but the other -PRON- have be to be very uncomfortable for -PRON-

sure that small 8 ounce cup -PRON- give -PRON- of broccoli cheese will curb -PRON- craving satisfy -PRON- grain longing desire coat in a rich oozy cheese heaven of cheddar bursting with soft steam lush green broccoli bunch
sure it will
chach
ms. robinson be so easy to work with
-PRON- have help guide -PRON- business partner and -PRON- in make some really tough legal decision
-PRON- take the time to explain all of the option and have make the legal process not as scary
if -PRON- be look for an amazing attorney ms. robinson be the right choice
chocolate chocolate everywhere fondu mound drink cake with ice cream browni

what -PRON- do have be buckwheat crepe which be great
there be maybe a dozen variety -PRON- be with chicken spinach and goat cheeze
totally enjoyable and unique
-PRON- be not a stuff -PRON- meal but well worth go for
super duper good burger
love this spot
yes if -PRON- want a neat little burger go to the other place but if -PRON- want a huge fantastic messy burger this be the stuff
come in here hungry after a very long day because -PRON- see the jays game on
order the chicken parm with side fettuccine alfredo
the sauce on the parm be very tasty but the alfredo be bland as can be
salt do not help
wish there have be more sauce on the parm
-PRON- would have turn that alfredo into a rose just so that -PRON- would taste of something anything
service be good enough
seem like one person on duty in the dining room all night include the bar
on a friday night that surprise -PRON-
but hey -PRON- do well
eat pay leave
no big story here
lou show up exactly on time and do the preventative maintenance on both -PRON- heat pump and pool heater
get everything take care of in under an hour include repair where a seal be fail
great service and be now go to have the ac guys do -PRON- ongoing maintenance so -PRON- unit run more efficiently and hopefully get a few extra year of use from the old unit
this be similar to change oil in -PRON- vehicle where -PRON- spend some money to save money
atmosphere 5\/5 the first word that come to mind when -PRON- walk into the place be groovy
the neon lighting wrap around the curve back wall cuban artwork that literally pop out of the canvas brightly color shelf hold cuban theme sculpture and funky shade of green blue orange and red cover the place all add up to make a lovely change of scenery from all the other restaurant of -PRON- caliber in the area
libation
4\/5 -PRON- have -PRON- pisco sour which be just as -PRON- have come to expect out of the drink from have -PRON- at many other bar
-PRON- friend order a caiprinha the only pittsburgh restaurant -PRON- have see so far with those on the menu and -PRON- be a perfect rendition of the classic latin cocktail
overall -PRON- give -PRON- a 5\/5 for the solid sour and for make true caiprinhas but will subtract one star for have the unoriginal dull drink selection
food
5\/5
-PRON- order 3 taco the tempura fish the huevos ranchero and the blt
-PRON- come out in -PRON- favorite little serve tray for taco the metal w holder that keep -PRON- in a perfect taco form
-PRON- start with the tempura fish which taste like a great roll of sushi in a taco shell
the peanut aioli be a great touch too
the blt be just good nothing exciting but a good taco nonetheless
-PRON- finish with the phenomenal huevos ranchero
-PRON- be a sucker for anything with egg in -PRON- and especially this taco
the maple hot sauce be a perfect balance of hot and sweet which combine with the egg 's texture and cheese flavor make for one hell of a taco
-PRON- be get hungry just remember the taste
would definitely recommend seviche if -PRON- be in the area and look for a change of pace from the usual restaurant
always busy but super efficient
-PRON- really know how to handle a crowd
the food be always tasty
-PRON- especially love the neapolitan milkshake
-PRON- go here as there be many choice for -PRON- vegetarian husband
-PRON- get the veggie burgerburger which -PRON- say be interesting and -PRON- like -PRON-
-PRON- get the spicy tuna roll and a baja taco
-PRON- be concerned about the spicy tuna roll not be enough for a full meal however -PRON- would have be plenty
-PRON- be beautiful to the eye but could have be more flavorful
the baja taco be good
-PRON- great disappointment of the meal be -PRON- margarita
at a cost of $ 10 plus -PRON- be mostly ice with a little bit of margarita
not worth the 10 buck as there really be nothing special about -PRON- and -PRON- be go after -PRON- take three drink
-PRON- do give high mark on the service
-PRON- be a busy night
-PRON- be tell a 10 minute wait
but -PRON- be more five
very friendly staff and the food come out quickly
one or -PRON- girl friend 's have be rave about this place since forever so -PRON- decide to give -PRON- a try
-PRON- decide to try the poutine and -PRON- can not lie -PRON- be a really good poutine
gravy be super tasty and the perfect consistency
-PRON- also get a side of guac and hot sauce
-PRON- love the hot sauce -PRON- be super tasty without overdo -PRON- on the heat
on the other hand the guac be super salty and have too much in -PRON-
sometimes less be more and this rule definitely apply to guac in general
overall -PRON- enjoy -PRON- food but find -PRON- to be a bit more on the pricy side consider the box be only fill up half way
-PRON- would come here if -PRON- be in the area but would not go out of -PRON- way for big bite burrito
-PRON- would give zero star if that be an option
paid 300 to move damage -PRON- entertainment center and couch
-PRON- bed now have a weird stain on -PRON-
but that s not why -PRON- be write this review
-PRON- have a gun safe with 4 gun cash and amo in -PRON-

upon ask an employee which wet food be the good for -PRON- cat -PRON- get into a discussion about how raw food be actually good for -PRON-

fish n chip taco good
tomato soup dumpl -PRON- favorite
french onion soup dumpl good

mac n cheese good sirloin a bit too dry
the food be wholesome and well worth the price
however this be not the soul food experience -PRON- be hop for
nothing be make to order and accommodation be minimal
all in all -PRON- be a good budget eatery for the local but not -PRON- hope representative of real southern african american cuisine
aria entrance be pretty nifty with a sweeping waterfall fountain surround the perimeter of the arrival circle
when i walk to the cvs on the corner there be a kind of whistle noise that i be not sure if -PRON- be the wind and building or something -PRON- amplify

even to the cosmopolitan a neighbor hotel in citycenter -PRON- be get a bit lost
the room be small than wynn but also half the price
-PRON- have a broken light in the room and make -PRON- very dark for most of the stay
when -PRON- notify -PRON- -PRON- take -PRON- a few hour to come and fix -PRON-
by that time -PRON- be out of the room
the tub shower and toilet be all in the same room make -PRON- somewhat difficult to share a bathroom
the tub be inside the shower too
-PRON- can actually see daylight from within the casino which i think be pretty neat
haha
the lobby smell of vanilla
if -PRON- do not like the scent
i can see that -PRON- can be annoying
upon arrival there be also quite a few people who be on scooter be be not disabled
i be guess -PRON- can rent -PRON-
come here when -PRON- be xtreme sushi and when -PRON- be buy out by someone else
this new owner 3rd time be buy out be really nice and -PRON- entertain -PRON- after -PRON- meal

actually whether -PRON- be in bill 's gambling hall or now harrah 's piano bar big elvis have be perform to a sell out room
what make big elvis a great performer be that -PRON- seem that -PRON- be sing directly to each person in the room
that be a sign of charisma
big elvis ought to be call big charisma
there be countless elvis presley imitator
what make big elvis stand out from the elvis presley imitator be -PRON- remarkable voice
before the show start and between set -PRON- will play a big elvis album
in all honesty -PRON- have not be able to tell the difference between the voice of the king of rock roll and the self name king of the strip
the three set from 2 to 7 pm on monday tuesday thursday and friday showcase -PRON- voice
all eye and ear be draw on this giant of a man seat on a king chair sing elvis presley song back up by music from a karaoke machine
-PRON- have never grow tired of -PRON- voice
the song -PRON- sing range from fast number that include viva las vegas burn love,"and little sister to ballad that include -PRON- way and always on -PRON- mind
-PRON- favorite big elvis moment be when -PRON- sing american trilogy which be a very patriotic song that -PRON- dedicate to the troop
in the year that -PRON- have see the big elvis show -PRON- opinion of the show have range from three to five star
a back story to the show have be big elvis s major weight loss
-PRON- go from weigh in the ball park of 950 pound to approximately 450 pound
that be 500 pound lose
in a way a back story of the big elvis show be that determination pay
the good big elvis show be a couple of year ago in 2009 after -PRON- lose all that weight
in 2013 there have be change that keep the show from a five star rating
the sun
studios dueling guitar set be go
chuck rawlins a conway twitty impersonator with a five star voice who be a part of the act have leave the show
the big elvis show have move from the party time atmosphere of bill 's gambling hall to the corporate atmosphere of harrah 's piano bar
where bill 's gambling hall serve pitcher of beer for $ 7 harrah 's sell small bottle of beer for $ 7 next store small bottle of beer be $ 1 at casino royale
in bill 's gambling hall -PRON- seem that the king of the strip be the king of bill 's gambling hall
the sound of the big elvis show dominate the open space of bill 's gambling hall
when big elvis perform a people at the slot machine and bar celebrate with big elvis
however in harrah 's piano bar the room be cramp and the piano in the center because visibility issue
the big elvis show be more than listen to elvis presley and classic by other artist
the big elvis show have a couple of audience participation segment
one be where a man in the audience will dress up in an elvis wig and play a balloon guitar while five woman from the audience join -PRON- in dancing
usually big elvis be perform burn love or viva las vegas
people will find -PRON- entertaining or corny
-PRON- find -PRON- the later and never once participate
-PRON- recommend see the big elvis show
admission be a $ 7 beer
not expensive for a show
big elvis sing the song make famous by a man that -PRON- admire
-PRON- show
elvis presley 's real life good friend sonny west be the good man at big elvis s public wedding in bill 's gambling hall
big elvis wear elvis presley 's tcb take care of business ring
through -PRON- admiration big elvis introduce song with interesting elvis presley fact and follow a few similar tradition of an elvis presley concert
big elvis may give a scarf to a person in the audience
and -PRON- could end the last set with can not help fall in love with -PRON-
-PRON- relationship with the big elvis show appear to be strong
big elvis still have big charisma that leave -PRON- feel anything but all shake up
the daniel
s challenge
review 86
this morning -PRON- have intend to go to vintner grill for brunch however -PRON- website have not be update show -PRON- reduced hour
so -PRON- end up go to bj 's brew house nearby
although -PRON- prefer to patronize independent restaurant since chain be not usually too exciting -PRON- find -PRON- can get decent food at reasonable price and the food be always consistent
obviously everyone else must feel the same because -PRON- do not see too many of -PRON- close once -PRON- have open and well just look at every street corner in urban area
-PRON- order the french toast combo $ 7.95 but sub the adult french toast for the child 's cap'n crunch coat and fry french toast
-PRON- do not know why -PRON- would order sugar coat and deep fry food for -PRON- child but -PRON- sound pretty good
so -PRON-
though -PRON- would give -PRON- a whirl
the egg come out nice and hot and the apple smoke bacon be of decent quality but not crispy enough for -PRON- taste
the french toast be especially crispy but do not fall into the category of lightly fry as the description on the menu suggest
at first -PRON- think -PRON- be alright
but then -PRON- press down with -PRON- fork and see oil start to pool
yuck
-PRON- reluctantly cut into the other piece which be astonishingly good
the cap'n crunch taste be nowhere to be find but -PRON- be much light and a fun version of french toast
ian have the grill chicken and cheese stuff baked potato $ 8.95
the alfredo sauce that accompany -PRON- taste like -PRON- be straight out of a bag of bertolli 's frozen pasta really bad and the potato be unexciting
-PRON- be definitely a gmo potato if -PRON- would ever see one
what be america come to
-PRON- be a very critical when -PRON- come to japanese curry
-PRON- love japanese curry but -PRON- feel very loyal to curry house
so -PRON- compare everything to curry house
-PRON- come here with -PRON- friend for a late lunch while -PRON- be in vegas
-PRON- get the spicy level of curry here
-PRON- love spicy food
-PRON- be a good spice level
-PRON- get the standard chicken katsu curry
portion be pretty big here
-PRON- be pretty good but the flavor of the curry be okay
this place suck
while -PRON- can gamble at the bar and play keno the food and service be awful
when -PRON- be seat -PRON- take about 5 minute to order
after that -PRON- sit for 30 40 minute wait for -PRON- food
-PRON- have fish and chip and -PRON- be the bad fish and chip -PRON- have ever have
fry be lukewarm and fish be stick together and chewy
for 20 $ -PRON- be god awful
for be in the middle of the rio -PRON- figure -PRON- would be good but no
will never comeback or recommend
this be not a garden center
-PRON- may think of a warehouse for pet food only -PRON- have some
so so plant under grow light
if -PRON- be want a real garden center look elsewhere
die alte ziegelei ein nett eingerichtet speiselokal das in einem etwa abgelegenen areal mit großzügigem parkpl gegenüber von eisenbahng
gelegen ist
störend ist der offene raum er verströmt den prostituierenden charm einer bahnhofvorhalle
wir hatten den vorzug -PRON- be nebenz
einer familienf
bedient zu werden eigentlich soweit alle einem gut bü
lokal zuzurechnen
der service war o.k die speisen jedoch nicht
ich hatte einen pfefferrostbraten in rahmsosse mit pommes normal kann man das in lokalen dieser
coleur immer essen
meine gattin orderte kässpätzle mit fleischkäse
wir waren beide sehr unzufrieden die bedienung hat schon gar nicht gefragt ob es geschmeckt hat
-PRON-
be telegrammstiel
rostbraten = nicht würdig so genannt zu werden fleisch zu klein nur 1\/4 ein normalen rb zu dünn zu durchgebraten und zäh und an rand ausgetrocknet preis wurde nicht nachgefragt wegen einladung pfeffersosse war aufgepeppt pomme akzeptabel dekoratin spärlich
kässpätzle = nicht würdig dieser köstliche schwäbische spezialität zugerechnet zu werden spätzle waren teilweis ausgehärtet und verbraten käse nur teilweise sichtbar und keineswege sahnig oder chremig der fleischkäse war vom metzger auf den teller
der eindruck dass diese speisen schon lange vorher in der vorhalte waren war nicht zu verkennen
wir werden da nicht mehr hingehen
good food service model can be confusing for first timer
and line up to order overwhelming
there be a separate area where the wait staff will take -PRON- order at -PRON- seat but -PRON- believe that there be a mandatory tip for this section
the melting pot burger + fried cheese curds = heaven
-PRON- be soo good and fill that -PRON- almost do not finish -PRON-
this place compete for good burger in madison with all the cheese + special sauce -PRON- put on -PRON- burger
gameworks be really fun
-PRON- love the outrun driving game
for an indian who crave good indian food -PRON- be not always easy to find in pittsburgh
the mintt be probably -PRON- favorite place to get indian food in pittsbugh second only to udupi in monroeville
-PRON- have eat here three times-
once a proper off the menu dinner and twice at the weekend buffet lunch
pro the food be excellent
if -PRON- want to try something other than the standard vegetable in cream sauce type food mintt be -PRON- place
the chef be from hyderabad -PRON- believe and -PRON- bring that flair to some of the more unusual dish -PRON- serve
for -PRON- sit down dinner -PRON- have the whole eggplant in the sesame sauce and -PRON- be a revelation
indo chinese vegetable manchurian be a specialty of mine and -PRON- can safely say that mintt 's be finger lick good
off the buffet -PRON- really enjoy the paav bhaji- spicy curry mash potato with buttered toast bread a street side snack which be not a common find
same go for the tava vegetable this time- very nicely do
the dessert be good and not water down
con
-PRON- be -PRON- standard ethnic restaurant in that service can be spotty and the buffet table may not be properly stock with the right kind of dish
the chai while excellent in flavor have be lukewarm both time
for the sake of the food though -PRON- would gladly overlook these little hiccup and return to mintt each time
this location be basically a drop off and pick up location only
-PRON- be mainly a distribution station where courier drive out of to deliver package
the specific location have supply for pack up box and such but -PRON- do not pack -PRON- for -PRON-
also there be not print service here like most people believe
there be a dropbox that get pick up at 6:00pm and -PRON- do have a drive thru -PRON- can utilize if -PRON- package be ready to drop off without need a receipt
this place be perfect if -PRON- be ready to go
nothing go better with mexican food than margaritas
and luckily at jalapeno 's -PRON- have a trio sampler
so -PRON- get choose and enjoy three drink for $ 10
both -PRON- girlfriend and -PRON- love seafood food so -PRON- work out that -PRON- get the lobster taco
sweet lobster meat with cilantro onion and cheese which come with a big serving of rice and bean and -PRON- gf get the tequila lime shrimp taco so -PRON- could trade off
both meal come out quickly and the plate be massive
-PRON- gorge on the delish taco which go great with -PRON- margaritas
-PRON- waitress be great and -PRON- joke how -PRON- have a wheelbarrow out back to carry -PRON- out
not go to lie -PRON- almost take -PRON- up on the offer -PRON- be stuff
this place be awesome -PRON- can not wait to come back here when -PRON- be in scottsdale again
-PRON- husband and -PRON- decide to go to the palomino this trip
while -PRON- have fun -PRON- be not the good and probably will not go back
-PRON- pull up and could not figure out the parking look like -PRON- be all valet but there be parking in the back
-PRON- get there and -PRON- comp'd -PRON- both -PRON- entry so that make -PRON- less expensive to get in very nice
the girl be okay a couple very nice
-PRON- be hop to get a dance from some but unlike other club -PRON- have be to these girl be the exact opposite of pushy
-PRON- keep come up to -PRON- and chat and then leave -PRON- without ever ask if -PRON- want a dance
-PRON- still have fun but leave a bit frustrated
-PRON- go to the other side of the building to go see the guy and the atmosphere of course change
louder but more well light and look more like a bar that happen to have male stripper than anything
the guy be good look and a couple very hot
-PRON- be have fun and -PRON- make -PRON- laugh and have fun too
definitely save the night
-PRON- be way off the strip and the neighborhood be a bit intimidating at least for a tourist
overall -PRON- have fun but for now -PRON- think -PRON- will explore the one a bit closer to the strip
-PRON- do not think -PRON- will go back
the chicken be hard and very drip oil wife and kid do not like -PRON- have to give leave over to -PRON- dog -PRON- would go to kfc next time
kind staff cool character figure tasty definitely come back for next vegas trip
-PRON- feel like -PRON- have be transport back to the 90 's every time -PRON- visit this place and -PRON- love -PRON-
-PRON- be pretty sure -PRON- be the last video store standing and -PRON- hope -PRON- never go away
-PRON- always have everything -PRON- be look for new or old and -PRON- 5 movie 5 day $ 5 deal on 1 year+ old movie be a great deal
everyone who work here be friendly and helpful too
-PRON- be a huge fan of video paradise
-PRON- highly recommend brighton dental health
-PRON- have have many dentist in the past but dr yu be by far the very good
-PRON- be so kind caring and attentive and -PRON- be extremely knowledgeable
-PRON- ask question and take -PRON- feedback when -PRON- have a problem
when -PRON- have issue with grind which -PRON- do not even know be a thing -PRON- tell -PRON- about -PRON- potentially be a problem
after a few more visit -PRON- realize -PRON- need -PRON- because -PRON- be happen in -PRON- sleep
and -PRON- wake up tired
-PRON- be highly experienced and -PRON- be a family practice
super friendly staff
so there -PRON- be at 11 be on a sunday morning stand adjacent to the bathroom in a narrow hallway behind a long line of other prospective patron
a long line mean either the restaurant be poor at seating serve and turn over or the food be just that good
happily for creme de la creme -PRON- be the latter
a small caveat here -PRON- have a soft spot for family own restaurant
orange juice tea medium poach egg and toast with melty butter jam be -PRON- idea of a good breakfast add in the hash brown and tomato and -PRON- have get a fan
-PRON- friend have a bespoke omlette that look huge but delicious
the hustle and bustle the good humour family atmosphere and be serve by people who love what -PRON- do all add to the ambience
i'd go back for sure
i'll try the egg benny with salmon next
go to this place while visit family in henderson this place be amazing
-PRON- raspado and other chuchuluco snack be on point
-PRON- sure appreciate a place that have snack like this place
-PRON- guy rock -PRON- only question be when be -PRON- open a location in phoenix
c'mon man
order a toasted bagel at -PRON- drive thru
give a not toast bagel
-PRON- promise -PRON- will survive but how much effort do -PRON- take to fill a simple order
after have a great experience on a previous trip -PRON- just have to go back
the menu be pretty small but pretty much everything be good and the portion be huge
one order can feed two people
-PRON- do have a late nite menu but the portion be slightly small the reason for the 3 star be the lack of service
although the food taste great the wait time between the first order and last be at least 30 minute and -PRON- all order at the same time
some order do not have fruit even though on the menu -PRON- clearly state that -PRON- be suppose to have -PRON-
be tell by the waiter that on that particular order do not come with -PRON-
after request for a refill on water -PRON- waiter pass by -PRON- table 4 time avoid eye contact until -PRON- come by with the pitcher of water
-PRON- be not sure how good the service be on breakfast but the service for a saturday night be pretty bad
great sandwich -PRON- have the chicken pesto and fast service
-PRON- be in around 10:30 and the place be pretty empty so service be super fast
not sure how -PRON- be during busy breakfast and lunch time
-PRON- be excited to come back and try other meal
the reason -PRON- be even give -PRON- two star be simply for the view
if -PRON- be lucky enough to sit out in the patio then -PRON- will enjoy a beautiful view of the bellagio fountain
otherwise the ambience be not the good
the restaurant be very crowded with table close together and very dark
the food here be very average
-PRON- friend get macaroni and cheese which be fancy macaroni so -PRON- use all kind of cheese in -PRON-
-PRON- friend do not care for -PRON- and -PRON- leave a weird aftertaste in -PRON- mouth
also the presentation of the mac be less than appeal
just a blob of mac in a bowl
-PRON- would expect more for $ 20 macaroni
-PRON- have the sea scallop
-PRON- come with 4 and -PRON- be very small
on the menu -PRON- say that -PRON- come with asparagus
when -PRON- check with -PRON- server -PRON- say oh a mixed vegetable
-PRON- scallop come out with a corn and pea mix
be -PRON- kid -PRON-
-PRON- be serve -PRON- frozen pea and corn with frozen small scallop at a fine dining restaurant and charge -PRON- $ 30 for -PRON-
not ok
-PRON- also have a dinner salad that come out with a hair in -PRON-
-PRON- server barely apologize for this and bring -PRON- a new dinner salad
the second one be half the size of the first and look like a mess
-PRON- just through -PRON- in a bowl quickly to get -PRON- out to -PRON-
the dinner salad be $ 9.95 and -PRON- be literally lettuce with about 4 slice of tomato and -PRON- take about 4 bite to eat the whole thing
when -PRON- get -PRON- bill -PRON- salad be still on the bill
and -PRON- have to ask the server to remove -PRON- which -PRON- do
service be bad
food be average\/bad and the pricing be very high
-PRON- will definitely not be go back here
have a fantastic time here this afternoon
-PRON- be lucky that -PRON- arrive right before the lunch rush
oren be super friendly and hand out sample of the delicious hot link while -PRON- be wait
-PRON- order a platter with the pull pork and beef brisket
the pork be scrumptious but the brisket be -PRON- favorite tender and juicy
naked bbq do not cover -PRON- meat so the food do not come slather in sauce -PRON- add some sweet sauce and vinegar as desire -PRON- also have spicy and mustard variety
the cornbread muffin and maple bacon donut be a perfect dessert to finish the meal
ambience be lay back and decor be rustic without be corny
great neighborhood eatery
will definitely be back soon
great brake service at a fraction of dealer price
-PRON- take -PRON- car here for front brake pad and installation of rotor -PRON- purchase on -PRON- own
the manager test drive the vehicle to confirm that -PRON- need the service and then tell -PRON- how much -PRON- would be to do brake pad and rotor on the rear
cool thing be -PRON- do not try to sell -PRON- service -PRON- do not need and follow -PRON- direction to do the front with installation of rotor -PRON- buy
a lot of place will not install customer purchase part
45 minute -PRON- be do and -PRON- brake no longer shake when -PRON- need to stop
-PRON- be happy -PRON- take -PRON- coupon and -PRON- save on part
-PRON- will be back next week to do the rear

-PRON- do not have any child of -PRON- own but
every time someone come to visit or move here that do this be the let go here and let the kid play place
-PRON- late visit there be so many kid and adult alike in the spray water area be so oblivious to the other in the area
-PRON- be really disappointed but

-PRON- be def a highlight of the day and have never disappoint be here a couple time in the cold month and the playground equip be so nice that the kid will play for hour

-PRON- place -PRON- order use the starbucks app
this starbucks have a drive thru
-PRON- get there and indicate that -PRON- be pick up -PRON- order
the barista be perhaps have a down day
-PRON- sound unenthusiastic break the news that -PRON- be out of cold brew coffee
instead -PRON- be fine with just regular iced coffee
so -PRON- get -PRON- drink
all be well
-PRON- need -PRON- to drive into work for another meeting but -PRON- be only three hour long
yay 232
-PRON- just move to gilbert so -PRON- start frequent this starbucks
every single time -PRON- have be here the employee be beyond rude
time to find another coffee shop since this be how starbucks allow -PRON- employee to treat -PRON- customer

-PRON- be so happy the original pancer family be run the restaurant again
the deli meat be delicious
-PRON- be not a fan of coleslaw but -PRON- 's be really tasty and not to much vinegar
the potato salad be creamy not dry
this be -PRON- favourite place to pick up a deli dinner or eat in
-PRON- receive a dinner platter last night
if -PRON- have to send in a dinner or cater -PRON- strongly suggest this as -PRON- go to deli choice
the presentation and selection be beautiful
-PRON- come with a 5 selection generous amount of cold cut the slaw potato salad sweet pepper kosher style dill mustard plate napkin and cutlery
the people who send the dinner in say the service be so friendly
stac polly come highly recommend by -PRON- hotel -PRON- have just complete a tour of edinburgh castle w\/ nowhere else to go nothing else in the vicinity -PRON- end up arrive about 15 min early consequently 15 min before -PRON- open
plus when travel w\/ parent -PRON- be eat the early bird timetable which actually work out well since -PRON- be almost always guarantee reservation
there be 2 guy still set up for the evening 1 invite -PRON- in the other look incredibly apparently perturb
gee -PRON- be sorry
shall -PRON- go stand out in the rain for 15 min while -PRON- finish -PRON- conversation
not a good start to -PRON- evening
-PRON- liken -PRON- dark beer caledonian ale to more of an amber ale try 2 different variety but think -PRON- be both lack a certain something start out w\/ a poached pear
w\/ cheese
-PRON- be okay but cold
guess
this be what -PRON- get for be the 1st to dine thing right out of the fridge
both mom dad have the salmon which -PRON- enjoy -PRON- veggie risotto be
crunchy enough say only dad order dessert the strawberries cream the verdict be delish
the strawberry be super sweet when combine w\/ the cool fresh cream -PRON- be perfection would be willing to give this place another try
-PRON- be not like -PRON- hat -PRON- meal well -PRON- do
-PRON- just be not wow for this kind of £ £ £ -PRON- would probably seek elsewhere next time
great food great service reasonable price and atmosphere be conducive to comfortable dining
have breakfast lunch and supper
arizona 's premiere christian university
this be great place to work and go to school
go lopes
be here about 5 time now and honestly -PRON- be a fan of 1 item
the chorizo hash
be sooo amazing
-PRON- come with 1 biscuit too
the biscuit be delicious with -PRON- homemade jam and honey
hopefully -PRON- order the dish that include this
otherwise -PRON- be a whoppin $ 2
-PRON- be free during dinner
-PRON- even have a thanksgiving meal here once
and -PRON- be pretty delish
-PRON- think this place be too focused on the massive portion and not really focus on the taste of the food
-PRON- seem to have a great happy hour go on though
but who pay for drink when -PRON- be in vegas
not muuua~ great view of the pool and the strip
-PRON- go to this restaurant more than once a week
the food be very fresh very tasty and owner be very nice
-PRON- highly recommend the breakfast sandwich but everything i have eat there be amazing
one of the issue -PRON- have overlook be the way a walk in be greet
99%of the time be can -PRON- come back in an hour?if get a pedicure -PRON- will always pacify -PRON- to have -PRON- foot soak
have -PRON- ever have an issue with -PRON- nail and then return to have -PRON- fix -PRON-
yikes
the owner who be the male that greet -PRON- ask -PRON- what be wrong while work on a patron
there be dead silence and everyone turn around and stare at -PRON-
-PRON- then belittle -PRON- in front of everyone
in the end -PRON- will even charge -PRON- to fix the mistake
where be the customer service
-PRON- be so embarrassed
this place deserve every 5 star review -PRON- be get
at first -PRON- be somewhat weary of the 50.00 price tag but -PRON- have no issue pay -PRON- now as -PRON- plan on go again next month when -PRON- husband and -PRON- be in vegas
the escape room -PRON- do before be a room with prop this be an experience
-PRON- do not want to give anything away but be prepared to be completely emers in the story and not just in a room solve clue
-PRON- will not be disappoint
this be comparable to work out with a personal trainer but at a fraction of the cost
-PRON- motivate -PRON- to come to class
and -PRON- get the individualized attention -PRON- need
lee know exactly when to push -PRON- and when to back off
there be modification for every exercise which be good since everyone in class in be at a different fitness level
the energy in class be very encouraging and positive
-PRON- would highly recommend this program to anyone and -PRON- have suggest that several of -PRON- friend join
in the next couple of week -PRON- be hop to get -PRON- husband start
-PRON- go to vegas for a short golf vacation and decide to play the nine hole here as -PRON- first stop
the par 3 's be really short and not much of a challenge if -PRON- can hit a ball straight
-PRON- be really hot so -PRON- get lazy and rent a cart however the price for a cart be only good for 9 hole
if -PRON- continue play -PRON- will need to pay the cart fee again and again and again
-PRON- only play 9 hole and then -PRON- be bored
so -PRON- leave
the golf shop be not very impressive
-PRON- be a huge callaway fan club golf ball bag clothe and do not see anything that -PRON- have not see in a golf mart
the salesperson walk around be sort of pushy and try to convince -PRON- to buy stuff -PRON- do not need
not sure -PRON- would be worth -PRON- time to come here again when -PRON- visit las vegas
-PRON- friend be sexually assault here by two man
ladies beware
despite this be a gay bar -PRON- friend be push and sexually assault by two man work in tandem
accord to -PRON- description -PRON- seem to have do this before and will do -PRON- again
-PRON- have send management an email
and hopefully -PRON- friend will feel comfortable enough to reach out to -PRON- too
dining experience be not very good
-PRON- will not be go back
-PRON- serve the appetizer after one of -PRON- entree be serve
sushi be okay
-PRON- also do not have sake
-PRON- be shop in the area and decide that -PRON- be in need of refueling so -PRON- stop off here to grab a bite
-PRON- be greet right away and opt to sit outside on the porch
-PRON- waitress be out within a minute or so and take -PRON- drink order and fill -PRON- in on the daily special
-PRON- be very friendly
-PRON- decide on the chicken piccata and -PRON- decide on the lasagna both come with salad -PRON- go with caesar
the piccata be -PRON- favorite dish and there be a slight hint of lemon to the sauce which really kick up the flavor in -PRON- book
the chicken be obviously fresh and -PRON- be cut into perfect bite sized piece so no knife need on this dish
-PRON- lasagna be good but just be not anything to write home about although -PRON- would probably order -PRON- again if -PRON- be in the mood for a red sauce dish
the porch atmosphere be nice but the table feel really crowd
there be high top as well as regular table all line up in a row and when people walk by -PRON- be pretty much assure -PRON- be go to get bump into
the day be perfect for sit outside though so -PRON- be worth -PRON-
-PRON- be semi disappointed that -PRON- do not offer a tiramisu dish but the apple dessert do sound good and may have to happen next go around
overall a-
a touch crowded porch could not damper a good meal with a great view and friendly service
terrible service husband be active duty military -PRON- father be a disabled vet
upon arrival -PRON- ask if -PRON- have a military discount manager inform -PRON- that -PRON- would check but never come back
when the waitress come to the table -PRON- try again and decide to ask -PRON-
-PRON- say -PRON- will check with -PRON- manager and let -PRON- no again no response
when the check come again -PRON- ask inform -PRON- that -PRON- and -PRON- manager have forget
at this time -PRON- say -PRON- will ask -PRON- manager
after a short time -PRON- come back and say sorry -PRON- say no
then proceed to take -PRON- bill and charge the wrong bill to the wrong card
when explain to -PRON- that -PRON- be wrong
-PRON- blow -PRON- off with a sorry have a nice day
when -PRON- decide to address the fact that the manager do not have the egg to come to -PRON- table and tell -PRON- that -PRON- do not do anything for military -PRON- say oh -PRON- be go to do -PRON-
but that at this time -PRON- could not do anything because the bill have already be pay and could not refund anything
-PRON- husband do not expect to get discount anywhere however -PRON- do not feel very well when someone serve and do not even get the respect of a face to face
no
and -PRON- instead send -PRON- staff whom even admit that -PRON- tell -PRON- to go and tell -PRON- because -PRON- do not want to
$ 100 waste on bs mexican
chicken enchilada have no flavor salsa verde simply taste like lime and some sort of other weird grass like taste

thank to robin and -PRON- team for the fun time and experience
-PRON- will definitely come back and do -PRON- again
sugar bee 's item taste ok but -PRON- really need to show off -PRON- cake or other talent
the general selection of pasterie and sweet do not excite or inspire and be limit in -PRON- variety
the shop feel more like -PRON- be run by someone who be a good home baker yet not elevated to a professional level
hate nothing
dislike fruit casserole slightly soupy
like location next to other local favorite spot
the prix fixe menu
the happy hour special
the service
the top ten list on the wall
love the delicious food
the fusion concept

but -PRON- do not think -PRON- would order -PRON- again
-PRON- decide to go with the bacon avocado cheddar burger -PRON- three favorite ingredient combine -PRON- could not resist
after ask for -PRON- more than helpful server opinion -PRON- husband decide to go with the kokomo
about 10 15 minute later -PRON- order come out -PRON- be surprised to see the fairly large portion
-PRON- mouth be water longing to take that first bite
as soon as -PRON- sink -PRON- tooth into -PRON- burger -PRON- be let down
the burger be so bland -PRON- could not taste any seasoning at all
-PRON- be a total let down
-PRON- could not eat half -PRON- politely take the remainder of the burger home only to throw -PRON- away
the fry on the other hand be some of the good -PRON- have ever have
-PRON- do not think -PRON- will be stop by again any time soon
next time -PRON- think -PRON- will try the breakfast to be on the safe side
-PRON- have great service and decent food minus the burger
gallagher 's be a nice steakhouse nestle right in the ny ny casino walkway
-PRON- have the cowboy ribeye mac cheese and asparagus

the fry definitely taste horrible
but every in and out be pack every time -PRON- drive by -PRON-
kudo to -PRON- for somehow get people to wait for crap

-PRON- house be not gross or messy between school work and travel -PRON- just do not have time to deep clean like -PRON- should monthly
michelle ask if -PRON- need carpet clean and -PRON- already have an appointment set up but get everything do at once would be a lot easy

-PRON- have no clue obviously -PRON- go to look
but -PRON- be not go to walk in behind the building down rock to check for fricken spigot
and -PRON- could not see -PRON- anywhere anyway

needless to say deal with -PRON- through text message rather than a phone call be a pain in the ass
-PRON- reschedule for sunday july 31 2016 at 4 p.m. and 4 roll around and no one be still there to clean
-PRON- move thing around again for a no show

30 minute late to an appointment no call no message and
-PRON- take michelle 3 hours to answer if someone be still plan on come to clean
-PRON- figure -PRON- be good than nothing to esperanza clean
-PRON- really wish -PRON- would have take before and after because all -PRON- look like be -PRON- streak the mirror with windex vacuumed and take out the trash
-PRON- do not wipe a single baseboard
do not wipe a single blind
do not wash a single wall
use windex on -PRON- granite counter
-PRON- be ridiculous
-PRON- end up clean after -PRON- clean and -PRON- pay $ 85.00

-PRON- plan to let everyone -PRON- know and plan to make -PRON- company very well know with on how horrible -PRON- be

as -PRON- tell the woman who come to clean the house that -PRON- have -PRON-
-PRON- apology that -PRON- be not note in the message between -PRON- and i.

if i could give negative star -PRON- would
these guy be awesome
-PRON- call -PRON- at 3:45 on a saturday mother 's day weekend
and -PRON- squeeze -PRON- in
-PRON- must have call 3 4 place prior and be turn down flat
-PRON- take care of mom 's car would have be enough
but the staff be super polite clean restroom lobby plus cold water in the fridge
this place be awesome
the owner be so kind and welcome and make sure that -PRON- be get great service
-PRON- would highly recommend the paneer pakora to start with
drizzle some of that green sauce
-PRON- give -PRON- on -PRON-
yum
-PRON- waiter and the owner stop by multiple time to make sure -PRON- be do
okay
great
-PRON- have the muttar mushroom paneer without the mushroom
a+
-PRON- be absolutely obsess with indian food and this place have some of the good indian food ever
-PRON- would also recommend the garlic naan
superb
-PRON- will need something to soak up all that extra sauce and yumminess
very healthy and fresh food
-PRON- love go here and always leave happy and full
the have a great salad selection with a wide variety of protein -PRON- can add
-PRON- be frequently difficult to eat at a restaurant with a food allergy
recently one of -PRON- member eat at taco mac with -PRON- family include -PRON- allergic daughter
the staff be unable to find the allergy menu but the manager come to the rescue
-PRON- double check all of the label make the food -PRON- change glove and so on
-PRON- really go above and beyond and the family be so very grateful
be -PRON- in vegas
do -PRON- love awesome fantabulous dancing
the see the jabbawockeez at the monte carlo be a must
try to get there early as -PRON- do some preshow entertainment that will make -PRON- laugh
-PRON- sit in the front of section 2 second cheap seat and the view be really good
this be a small theater so even in the back -PRON- will get decent seat
-PRON- think if -PRON- sit in the front of section 1 -PRON- may miss some of the cool footwork that -PRON- do since -PRON- will be low than the stage
although -PRON- do a lot of audience participation so if -PRON- want to have the chance to dance with a jabbawockee get -PRON- to the front row
as for the show
-PRON- be entertaining
-PRON- will not lie there be some slow section but the high be super high and -PRON- be a woo girl for most of the night
-PRON- favorite part of the show be the variety of music there be hip hop classic rock a little mj and even a bit of singing in the rain
worth the money and 90 minute of -PRON- life
nowhere near as good as the melt restaurants
the bread be meh and the cheese be not even melt through
may give -PRON- another shot but not likely
little doubt that the food and service be excellent
ambience be a bit noisy and dark
but -PRON- be pricing be over the top
figure $ 150 per person without splitting
-PRON- first visit to tru burger wish -PRON- would have go to in and out
if the word burger be in the name of -PRON- restaurant -PRON- should have great burger
-PRON- order the barbecue burger medium
-PRON- arrive burn -PRON- send -PRON- back the second one be good but taste like a frozen age beef patty no seasoning and the bacon be not cook all the way
major fail with -PRON- burger
-PRON- boyfriend get the bison burger -PRON- be cook medium as order
-PRON- share the sweet potato fry -PRON- where over salt and seem to have be freeze
the service be slow -PRON- finally have a different waitress stop by and refill -PRON- drink
the waitress be all over place with table and -PRON- where not pack
-PRON- ask for a box to go
-PRON- bring -PRON- right away then 10 minute later ask if -PRON- want -PRON- check
duh when someone get a box to go and
the other person plate be empty -PRON- be ready to go
-PRON- take -PRON- 15 min to bring the check -PRON- just hand -PRON- -PRON- card before -PRON- could leave for another 10 min or more
this place have a lot to learn about run a restaurant
the front be run poorly and the food be not worth the money
head down the road to in and out burger
then go across the street to azool where the drink be cheap
if -PRON- charge $ 10 for just a burger -PRON- better be fantastic and -PRON- be not worth $ 5
muy bueno
do not pass up this spot just because -PRON- be in a tent
if -PRON- love sonoran hotdogs this be the best place to get one in north phoenix
grow up on the border of arizona sonora mexico the sonoran hotdog be 1 food -PRON- could not find in the valley for almost 20 yr
-PRON- son -PRON- wife find this place when lupita 's be just lupita with a hotdog cart
-PRON- can get -PRON- -PRON- way with several option i.e. with\/without bean type of salsa onion tomato etc
the soda be serve ice cold in glass bottle
the place be open for dinner stay open for the hungry bar crowd -PRON- hour change with the season
if -PRON- be hungry in the area perhaps want to eat before go to the movie at the harkins around the corner lupita 's be on 32nd street on the west side of the street just south of bell
there be a parking lot
do not pass just because -PRON- be in tent
-PRON- will not be sorry

-PRON- also let -PRON- have thing deliver if -PRON- want
-PRON- could literally spend the entire day there and tire the kiddo out in a clean and safe environment
love -PRON-
this be sort of a mixed review
there be some positive thing to say and some negative
however there be a lot of contractor out there who would have few negative so -PRON- have to go with two star
-PRON- meet cory at a home show
-PRON- be very friendly and -PRON- portfolio look good
so -PRON- have -PRON- out to check out -PRON- yard
after some discussion -PRON- produce a quote which -PRON- have to whittle down because -PRON- try to encompass everything instead of just the bit
-PRON- want -PRON- to do
after the whittling -PRON- be still a bit high but not completely outrageous
so -PRON- sign the contract -PRON- seldom go for the low bid
-PRON- be usually low for a reason
here be where -PRON- start to go less than perfect
-PRON- project include both water and electricity
-PRON- require some permitting
the drawing provide by cory be lovely but be not what be require for permit or to tell the other contractor what -PRON- be work with
-PRON- end up go to a separate draftsman to get proper submission worthy plan draw up extra $ $ $ because desert designer do not do that
really
the hardscaping -PRON- do have a problem and the water -PRON- utilize leak all over everywhere
-PRON- fix -PRON- but -PRON- be expect to have to utilize -PRON- two year warranty because -PRON- will bet -PRON- be go to get more crack
however -PRON- can not use that as a basis for rating since that have not happen yet
though -PRON- do have to d for only two year on the warranty
-PRON- fault for not insist on more at least 5
the electrical fail the first inspection
most of -PRON- be deep enough but there be a few place where -PRON- clearly be not
but -PRON- call for inspection anyway
yes -PRON- fix that too
but -PRON- should have be right first time
even -PRON- could see the violation on the first pass
the hardscape feature -PRON- be very lovely
-PRON- do have drainage problem and -PRON- be call -PRON- back to address -PRON- should be easy enough to fix
the water work well
-PRON- be really very attractive
so kudo there
then come the finish touch
the mortar use in part of the hardscaping be not tint
-PRON- be just gray
-PRON- have to fix that
the drainage -PRON- still need to fix can not have pool of water promote mosquito
and -PRON- site cleanup be deplorable
-PRON- leave a pile of river rock which -PRON- claim be not theirs instead of put -PRON- over into the hardscape area
-PRON- leave chunk of rock concrete and other debris
not just the usual little bit here and there but lot of -PRON-
include cigarette butt
the trench -PRON- have to dig be fill but be not compact very well
cory be very friendly and seem genuinely interested in do a good job and address -PRON- concern
-PRON- also seem to be very creative
-PRON- have some unseen boss that -PRON- have to run everything by for approval
and the nitty gritty stuff plans\/permits soil compaction site cleanup all the boring stuff be lack
-PRON- be up in the wexford area late that night in july when pittsburgh have all of that flooding
at 9pm the place be about half full and -PRON- be seat right away
-PRON- server roni be excellent
-PRON- drink come quickly along with some fresh bread which be delicious
-PRON- both order new york strips cook medium and -PRON- be prepare correctly and taste very good
-PRON- be pretty sure -PRON- have lobster bisque which be excellent
the ambiance be very nice -PRON- seem like a classy old steakhouse
-PRON- have never be to an atria 's before so -PRON- be glad -PRON- have a good first experience
overall the waitstaff give -PRON- the good service that -PRON- have have at any restaurant in a long time
nice work love -PRON- new house gate
after get -PRON- door install make a new order with -PRON- for some front gate for -PRON- house

the staff be very attentive and the food pho and bahn xeo be yummy
sprout and herb be fresh and plentiful

this restaurant take the place of chili 's right after -PRON- get thru tsa
the food be good and if -PRON- look for a sit down restaurant out of the hustle and bustle of the airport crowd this one fit the bill
do not be in too much of a hurry though -PRON- be not
-PRON- have eat here twice and that seem to be the norm not the exception
-PRON- have a great grill veggie omelet and -PRON- husband have some of the fluffier pancake -PRON- have see a while

-PRON- daughter really want to go again so -PRON- risk -PRON-
-PRON- could not believe how much the menu have go up in price
-PRON- be never a place -PRON- go if -PRON- be look for a bargain but -PRON- find a way to make -PRON- unreasonable
$ 15 for a burger or sandwich with a small amount of fry
if -PRON- want to add a salad or soup -PRON- be another $ 6
the burger and chicken sandwich be both good but a little pricey at $ 15
-PRON- daughter 's kid cheese pizza be $ 10 and come with a small drink
the pizza be comparable in size and taste to a personal size microwaveable pizza
-PRON- also see the kid hot dog and all -PRON- can say be -PRON- be glad -PRON- daughter do not order that
not that -PRON- would order a ny steak at a rf cafe but -PRON- be $ 33 and -PRON- still have to pay another $ 6 to add a salad
most item offer be over $ 20
the waiter be friendly and attentive but -PRON- food do take over 30 minute and -PRON- be not terribly busy for lunch

the place be a maze
the food be expensive
-PRON- room do not come with a coffee machine no raman for the really cheap kid
if -PRON- do want boil hot water -PRON- be $ 5 from room service
the only thing this place really have go for -PRON- be -PRON- be location

so -PRON- be pretty surprised to find -PRON- be the vegetable curry with all sort of greenery throw in that be -PRON- favourite
-PRON- expect -PRON- will be a regular visitor here though so that may change
-PRON- be place like this that really give a city
-PRON- 's character and -PRON- would much rather give -PRON- hard earn to the people of the mosque than many of the city 's more unscrupulous curry house owner
-PRON- urge -PRON- to do the same
very good taste
-PRON- get really full when -PRON- finish
and -PRON- offer free desert with a good rate on google yelp
so -PRON- know what to do
nice atmosphere
great service halibut sashimi 9.5\/10 lobster duo 8\/10
wagyu potsticker 7\/10 nothing special
edamame 7\/10 ordinary sake sampler 10\/10

-PRON- get a 6 and -PRON- be good
-PRON- be able to enjoy -PRON- food with a hint of spiciness
one of the fun thing be that -PRON- get to watch -PRON- food get cook in front of -PRON-

the staff be friendly and pretty funny love -PRON- when -PRON- have a sense of humor
-PRON- also get the bloody mary oyster shooters -PRON- be yummy too
-PRON- will be head back here
-PRON- really have a hard time call pomeroy 's a dive bar and when challenge -PRON- can not completely justify why -PRON- have this struggle

sure there be multicolor tinsel holiday light hang around the pool area
sure -PRON- sell schlitz and pbr and michelob 64

enough for chile in every bite
sandwich be serve with a choice of fry fruit salad cottage cheese or chip but really
when fry be involve be there
really a choice
in this case there be because -PRON- even have a couple of different type of fry crinkle wedge or shoestring
-PRON- guess that be the dilemma when -PRON- think of go to pomeroy 's -PRON- be as excited about the 15 beer on tap and cheap cocktail as -PRON- be about the food
-PRON- have think about go to pomeroy 's for lunch on a weekday without even the intention of sneak a brew in the middle of the work day
how about -PRON- call -PRON- a dive restaurant compromise
this place blow every single pizza chain restaurant in canada out of the water in -PRON- opinion

the atmosphere be fun and contemporary and feel great
there be no patio for smoker or those who want to eat outside
on a great note the sushi roll be very creative and by far the cool selection -PRON- have see

on a downside the restaurant be a little expensive but -PRON- have never be able to come in during -PRON- happy hour
also the service be bad
-PRON- can never really get a straight answer about thing on the menu and -PRON- never feel like the waitress care about -PRON- being there and help pay -PRON- salary

this review be for mercedes commercial department deal mostly with sprinter van
-PRON- be not use to business work so hard to make sure -PRON- get what -PRON- need
-PRON- be blow away by how accommodate and diligent -PRON- salesman david burchell be
-PRON- take all day to get -PRON- approve for a loan due to -PRON- credit but -PRON- team be able to get -PRON- in and out with a sprinter van the same day
after a rather long road trip and a few issue with the van the -PRON- handler with the service department jimi stevens take care of -PRON- issue with speed and accuracy
within an hour of drop off the van -PRON- have a diagnosis of several issue a quote for each issue and fix -PRON- all only take a day
if -PRON- have meet -PRON- tech -PRON- would be thank -PRON- here as well
-PRON- be not a mercedes guy
but after -PRON- experience with the sale and service team at mercedes henderson
-PRON- be a complete convert
go here after find out that there be another halal burger joint in toronto
-PRON- go around 5pm ish and find the place completely empty
-PRON- be assume because -PRON- be an awkward time to be have a meal lunch or dinner
anyway love the decor
there be only two employee there and -PRON- imagine the place to be much more inviting after see how interactive and exciting -PRON- be on social medium
no one greet -PRON- so -PRON- friend and -PRON- just decide what to get and the woman there take -PRON- order
not as enthusiastic as -PRON- think -PRON- would be
not that -PRON- be mean or rude or anything -PRON- be just hop -PRON- would show some emotion
-PRON- order -PRON- food and sit down and -PRON- be 30 degree out and -PRON- be boil inside the restaurant
-PRON- do not know why -PRON- do not turn the ac on
on to the food love -PRON-
-PRON- do not understand how people be say -PRON- burger be dry -PRON- be so juicy -PRON- be run down -PRON- finger
-PRON- order the big bang and love every bite
when i first get the tray the portion look small compare to the works but do not be fool
-PRON- be one fill meal
however -PRON- friend get a chicken burger special forget the name and say that -PRON- be not that fill but beef burger always fill -PRON- up more than chicken burger anyway
in summary -PRON- only complaint would be that the employee should be a bit more enthusiastic and that the ac should be on when -PRON- be 30 degree out
but besides that -PRON- food be on point and -PRON- aoili be to die for
will be return

endless street taco be interesting but -PRON- be only 3 type and unsurprisingly small
have the chile relleno special with a walnut sauce and pomegranate seed
fantastic the quality of the ingredient be above average and -PRON- be well craft and present
-PRON- would come back here for dinner
the food be fast and fresh -PRON- get to choose -PRON- topping and -PRON- also get to watch -PRON- food be cook
in the picture attach to this -PRON- can see -PRON- get a hamburger special which -PRON- just a hamburger with fry

manage to ruin 2 year worth of growth in one visit
-PRON- have never get an olaplex treatment and so much cut off and leave with -PRON- hair feel bad than before
all -PRON- want be -PRON- root touch up highlight and a trim
-PRON- make -PRON- clear over and over and over how hard -PRON- have be work to get -PRON- length but both senior stylist that work with -PRON- hair do not listen at all
how do -PRON- ask someone if -PRON- want a half inch trim and then take -PRON- off to above the shoulder
-PRON- blast an excessive amount of heat when drying\/styl as the curl be do use a hairdryer and -PRON- take quite a while damaging
-PRON- do a trim before curl -PRON- which -PRON- be ok with then chop off the rest
so -PRON- could not even tell since -PRON- hair be curly
-PRON- also find -PRON- strange that -PRON- charge extra for a toner -PRON- do not even last 2 wash
-PRON- strip -PRON- of -PRON- last 2 year and the hundred of dollar -PRON- have spend
a great place for brunch but also a place with a refreshing philosophy of use as many fresh local ingredient as possible

one of the bad breakfast -PRON- have have the sausage bacon and pancake where undercooked -PRON- be think that when guy fieri eat here -PRON- must have pay -PRON- off this place could be so much more but -PRON- need to have decent cook
-PRON- have work in the food industry and hold meat be a huge no no
needless to say -PRON- be here about 5 year ago and -PRON- be still no good
-PRON- be just an old restaurant and people who be nostalgic will go but please either go to fran 's or if -PRON- want a good bacon sandwich go to rashers around the corner both of those location do not take short cut to prepare a meal
also the staff talk about travel give -PRON- a bit of a headache -PRON- understand if -PRON- be in regard to serve customer or to the running of a restaurant but the mundane conversation be just add to the noise of the place
the good thing that -PRON- eat be the water and that be curtesy of the city of toronto
every time -PRON- go the food be always excellent

when -PRON- first find out that -PRON- would be stay at bally 's -PRON- be pretty indifferent since nothing about bally 's really stand out and make -PRON- appeal for -PRON- to stay at
however -PRON- be quite surprised by the wonderful experience -PRON- have
per yelper 's review -PRON- request -PRON- get a room in the jubilee tower which supposedly be the new renovated room

the food cost be separate and -PRON- be restaurant price
-PRON- have a flatbread bbq shortrib pizza like thing and -PRON- be good
-PRON- actually order food before -PRON- go in and -PRON- be think that -PRON- should have just order food right from -PRON- seat
still a great experience and a great date idea
-PRON- go to tanzy which be right next to the place and find that to be a great appetizer experience with an open air setting
-PRON- also hang around salt be well which be connect to the theater
great experience

-PRON- confirm that -PRON- would still get the hd version of the local station
then on -PRON- next bill -PRON- be charge $ 5\/mo for advanced tv
so -PRON- call and be tell that hd only available for free if -PRON- have an hd ready tv

lol
-PRON- soup and salad come out promptly and -PRON- be good 1\/2 way through the course the waiter come by to ask -PRON- husband if -PRON- want anchovy

just as -PRON- husband be get up to check on -PRON- meal the waiter bring -PRON- out
-PRON- then ask -PRON- to go with -PRON- into the kitchen and tell the chef that -PRON- actually order the steak tartare because -PRON- guess -PRON- could not believe -PRON- accord to the waiter

-PRON- husband be furious that there be not one apology for the situation or offer to refute -PRON- now cold steak
when -PRON- husband ask the waiter why the timing of -PRON- entree be off -PRON- say -PRON- do not put in the entree -PRON- tartare -PRON- assume
-PRON- husband ask for the manager and -PRON- be very gracious but do not seem to concern
-PRON- meal be comp

the entree be not eat
-PRON- be even give two voucher towards another visit to the capital grille -PRON- pass -PRON- on to friend who be local
the one star be for -PRON- eric -PRON- blow -PRON- off treat -PRON- poorly and be not very intelligent

-PRON- must say that yelp come through in the clutch with the strong review for naked fish 's food dining experience
the wife and -PRON- be look for a sushi dinner on last minute notice after work and want to try something close to the house
-PRON- find naked fish 's here on yelp and decide to give -PRON- a try

as for the food taste fresh quite delicious for be happy hour roll
-PRON- notice that even the tempura be cook well as -PRON- be not soggy or soft
-PRON- be still warm and crispy
only thing -PRON- would say against the roll be that the spicy tuna be not as spicy as -PRON- would have like and the wasabi be not that spicy either
kind of weird but still really good
after -PRON- finish that -PRON- order the special premium toro w\/ fresh wasabi salmon nigiri

what be with that anyway
-PRON- wish -PRON- could love this place as much as everyone else but -PRON- be just not there
-PRON- have have plenty of dim dim in -PRON- life and maybe the availability of asian food in auckland have spoil -PRON- or even just good dim sim place in london but -PRON- dining experience as stack be just
bland
the food -PRON- be alright but nothing -PRON- can not buy for cheap from the asian supermarket and make -PRON- at home
the sticky rice from the a.s be actually much good than the one at stack
the menu\/selection be not great and -PRON- have quite a large selection of the option but nothing be overly stand out
there be no condiment to go with -PRON- dim sim
the service consider there be 3 table while -PRON- be there be pretty slow and -PRON- physically have to get up to get the attention of the waitress to order more food
-PRON- be excited that there be a dim sim restaurant in edinburgh
but -PRON- will not be hurry back to stack
there be apparently one other place in town that offer dim sim
so -PRON- shall try there next time
most people post review when thing be not so great but henry be much more than a piano tuner

now live a little and give this latin street food a try
-PRON- will not be sorry
closed use sin city cupcakes instead -PRON- be great
one star because -PRON- be not professional enough to write on -PRON- website leave on -PRON- voicemail message or in an autoresponse to email that -PRON- be no longer in las vegas and have close down
-PRON- have be hear great thing about this place

-PRON- basically have -PRON- waste a whole day wait on -PRON- and then do not even have the professional courtesy to follow up

and -PRON- bring -PRON- mom and -PRON- bf along

the decor be cool
whenever -PRON- come back for that bomb dot com sushi -PRON- will be stick to appetizer because entrées at earls always seem to be painfully mediocre

in the summer -PRON- have a lovely patio which -PRON- have enjoy many time in the summer
-PRON- be write today nov 23\/16 because the excellent meal -PRON- have there last night
-PRON- be celebrate a special romantic occasion
the food be delicious and -PRON- order a couple of the special as well as some item off the regular menu
all delicious
-PRON- know from experience that the chef also make a special risotto on friday and saturdays which be the good -PRON- have ever have
if -PRON- want a very special treat make sure -PRON- go on friday or saturday night
reservation be recommend on weekend
-PRON- hope -PRON- enjoy this above average culinary experience as much as -PRON- do

try call several time only to get a recording saying will reopen on the 24th of october
-PRON- be the 3rd of november
this be the good show -PRON- have ever see in -PRON- life
-PRON- also help that -PRON- get free front row ticket from myvegas
the show be amazing and get splash with water do not affect -PRON-
-PRON- still have a great time
the costume be amazing the performer be great and the photographer outside of the theater be amazing as well
all in all a+++++
-PRON- do not know why this place get rat so high and appear on list of good burger in the gta
-PRON- try -PRON- once and be not very impressed
the food be extremely greasy
and -PRON- be not impressed by the taste or quality
the service be not very friendly
-PRON- seem like the staff do not want to be there
there be definitely good burger place out there
h2 eww
-PRON- be not eww at all but off the start -PRON- kinda have to question any place serve food have eau as part of -PRON- name due to how -PRON- sound
h2 eau be poolside dining at the trump
-PRON- probably would not want -PRON- to be any good since -PRON- be at a pool -PRON- be not like -PRON- be expect seafood or pasta here
the food quality be like room service but a bit cheap
when -PRON- want breakfast and do not feel like go outside the hotel and also do not want to pay the high room service fee that be where h2 eau come into the picture
-PRON- eat inside after order at the counter get -PRON- food a bit after 5 minute maybe
90 of those eat here be likely at the pool which be right outside so -PRON- just order from a server as plenty of -PRON- be always roam around
the restaurant -PRON- be small but -PRON- be so close to the pool that -PRON- basically feel like -PRON- be part of -PRON-
as to the food -PRON- have a ham and egg croissant fruit bowl and cranberry juice
there be not much to say about -PRON- -PRON- be decent enough that -PRON- would not shy away from go here if -PRON- be at the trump but -PRON- be not like -PRON- would really be look forward to -PRON- either
if -PRON- be go to spend some quality time at the pool then -PRON- can order some drink and perhaps a sandwich
the pool -PRON- be really low key for vegas so h2 eau just kinda add to that chill environment by offer drink and basic food option
-PRON- be fortunate enough while on -PRON- to trip to cleveland to celebrate -PRON- nephew bar mitzvah to be turn onto the scrumptious donut lab
-PRON- sister in law be smart enough to hire -PRON- to park -PRON- donut truck at -PRON- brother farm house for the party on absunday a couple of week ago
the donut be extremely tasty and bite size serve in little bag
-PRON- have -PRON- choice of powdered sugar cover donut or cinnamon cover donut or plain donut
all be very delicious and -PRON- have to say -PRON- eat quite a few
-PRON- do not regret a single bite
tasty tasty tasty
spread the word about this
-PRON- will be glad -PRON- do
love aj and have be to many location but this one just do not cut -PRON- for -PRON-
layout and staff be not as friendly as the other location and have be ignore on a few occasion
overall the quality of food be excellent just not the service at this particular one
great service
-PRON- be miss a part from -PRON- thule rack and vince find an extra in the back for -PRON-
so happy that -PRON- do not have to buy an entire new assembly
luv rei and the service at the tempe store
look for the good wing in charlotte
-PRON- have find -PRON- at flip n chicken
cook to perfection the wing be not too big and not too small
the sauce from mild to flip n atomic be delicious
serve with fresh breadstick carrot celery and homemade blue cheese
all if this top off with awesome customer service
thank to a seminar husband be attend -PRON- spend four night here
hotel be definitely of 3-star quality
bathroom towel amenity
all 3-star bed be comfortable enough
tv work
dislike when -PRON- ask for a refrigerator upon check in be tell -PRON- would have to upgrade to a petite suite for an extra $ 25 per night
uh no thank
meanwhile friend be able to get one for $ 10 per night
do not make -PRON- feel
all squirmy good that -PRON- do not get the ten dollar offer
another dislike
-PRON- room be near the ice machine\/vend machine room
for three day of -PRON- stay the ice machine beep non stop
after two day -PRON- be totally out of ice and still beep
right before -PRON- leave -PRON- stop beep
-PRON- figure -PRON- be be punish for not upgrade to a petite suite for a fridge
oh well who need cold drink right
parking
if -PRON- be stay in the hotel park in h.
this mean -PRON- get nice and close to the hotel
but there be step to lug luggage up to and a clunky door
again 3-star
but at least free parking
pool at last -PRON- have free time at a resort and can actually utilize a pool and guess what
-PRON- be not open on weekday
wtf
finally open on friday and oop close for wind
saturday open finally get to peek at -PRON- but
wah
do not have time to hang out
look nice enough for those of -PRON- that can actually utilize -PRON-
like food
restaurant be do -PRON- right here
will review separately but the cafe italian place and seafood all rock
-PRON- avoid the buffet as the first word -PRON- friend say to -PRON- when -PRON- arrive be do not go to the buffet
another like be the security
-PRON- always have a security guard inside the hotel entrance and by the entrance to the pool
-PRON- have to show -PRON- room key to get to the elevator and -PRON- have to use -PRON- room key to get up the elevator
kudos for security
casino
sigh
-PRON- want to love -PRON-
do have some fun
the obsession with the player 's card and tracking get really really old fast
-PRON- be just not that interesting
case in point four day of playing and buy thing equal a six dollar burger
at one point -PRON- be inform by a pit boss that -PRON- have a duplicate card
uh -PRON- do not sign up twice
required deal with the sign up place again and make to feel slightly like a criminal when -PRON- have not friggin do anything
as for dealer and pit boss some be friendly than other but there be not an overall feeling of let -PRON- have fun as -PRON- experience later at other casinos).machine wise -PRON- be generic look old none of the gimmicky trendy machine -PRON- see elsewhere
played some nothing exciting
overall quite smoky
there be a small area near the back that be smoke free
and -PRON- do mean small
look kinda like -PRON- be be punish if -PRON- want a smoke free area
not to mention machine choice be limit and certainly no table game
in other word stick with smoky
shop
have some time to kill
peruse the shop
bought a cute top on the sale rack
fortunately -PRON- wear -PRON- one night while -PRON- be there because now that -PRON- have come home and wash -PRON- -PRON- can pass -PRON- on to a toddler as -PRON- shrink ridiculously
and the ring
know -PRON- be a cheap one but expect -PRON- to last more than a month before tarnish
movie can not go to the pool
well there be a nice stadium seating theater with current movie one of which -PRON- enjoy
also enjoy a movie in the room at another time for about $ 11
meat be raw and food be just not good
chicken lolli taste like -PRON- be dress in ketchup
-PRON- least favorite mediterranean food -PRON- have ever have
not a huge fan of the overall disorderly atmosphere and inventory management but food cook on the premise be good if a bit pricey
service be hit or miss
right on the corner of las vegas blvd
and wyoming be this hidden gem that make the good sandwich ever
local know about -PRON- and tourist need to try -PRON-
everything be hand make and so so fresh
lastly the owner be so friendly and helpful
not the best bbq -PRON- have ever have but pretty good
-PRON- conveniently locate right across the street from -PRON- work so -PRON- a good quick lunch
get the pull pork sandwich and -PRON- be yummy the bread -PRON- sort of different -PRON- like buttery
-PRON- wish -PRON- be hungry enough to try some of the side
will update this review when -PRON- go back try some
-PRON- be on -PRON- way home a little after midnight
and -PRON- want a cold drink
this mcdonald 's be easy to get to
the drive through have three car in front of -PRON- but before long -PRON- have -PRON- diet coke order
and -PRON- be soon at the window pick -PRON- up
-PRON- generally do not stop in this neighborhood because there be other closer to home but this be perfect last night
a good stop with a pleasant and quick staff
-PRON- have to say -PRON- have -PRON- expectation up for this place but be quite disappointed
-PRON- happen to be an ovo lacto veggie and -PRON- have almost nothing for -PRON-
in the end -PRON- accommodate -PRON- as if -PRON- do -PRON- a favor and even then have chicken stock in -PRON- pasta gnocchi dish
this be after -PRON- make -PRON- clear to -PRON-
-PRON- be an ovo lacto veggie
the server austin be interesting but be very much catering to who be pay the bill at the table and have several laugh instead of try to accommodate -PRON-
even though -PRON- order cheese for the appetizer and brussel spout the latter never come to the table
-PRON- have to remind -PRON- of the order
overall utterly disappointing and border line discriminatory
-PRON- be not a pro hairstylist just a customer who be look for a cape to cut -PRON- husband 's hair who be homebound
-PRON- can not go to the barber and -PRON- do not know any barber who make house call
so -PRON- purchase one of these hair groom machine and just need a cape
when -PRON- enter the store nobody offer help the only lady work be fill shelf do not even offer help and when -PRON- walk up to -PRON- and ask where -PRON- would find the cape -PRON- just point in the direction never bother ask what kind or make any suggestion
when -PRON- pick the one -PRON- want and walk to the front to check out the lady be still fill shelf in the back of the store show up to check -PRON- out only after -PRON- shout back if -PRON- would mind check -PRON- out
not so nice but at least -PRON- have everything -PRON- need if -PRON- do -PRON- hair nail etc
-PRON-
-PRON- could not decide how many star to give
-PRON- be a tough call because the food be great and when split among friend the price be not bad
however -PRON- arrive when the place be pack -PRON- get a shitty chair -PRON- server screw up -PRON- order and -PRON- barely see -PRON- face
-PRON- suppose three star be fair because under good circumstance -PRON- would be swoon for this place
to break these element down
wait-
the interior bar and patio be completely pack which cause parking to be extremely limited and the wait for a table to be a bit long
20 minute in the cold make the wait questionable
-PRON- be so pack that a woman presumably a regular walk up to the door and scream oh hellllll nooooo this place better not be pack
a minute later -PRON- sit on a bench outside annoyed
the seating-
-PRON- girlfriend be -PRON- be seat outside on the patio
the good news be that -PRON- be next to a heater which be much appreciate
the bad news be that -PRON- table be push up against the glass wall in such a way that -PRON- have to do the bendie to squish -PRON- into -PRON- chair which by the way be lopsided so that -PRON- keep smack into the wall as -PRON- eat
-PRON- be also right by the door
so every time someone walk into the patio -PRON- sister get smack in the back of -PRON- seat
in the future -PRON- suggest wait a little long for a seat inside the restaurant
-PRON- server-
granted -PRON- be sure -PRON- be get work but -PRON- give off a cocky vibe and do not even write down -PRON- order
amazingly enough most of -PRON- item come out except for one
-PRON- get to the end of -PRON- meal ready to order -PRON- dessert and request that since the last item be clearly not come that -PRON- cancel the order
instead of cancel -PRON- -PRON- say -PRON- would check on -PRON- and if -PRON- be not cook already -PRON- would cancel -PRON-
-PRON- do not hear about that item until the bill arrive about 20 minute later and -PRON- say oh
yeah so -PRON- cancel that item
the redeeming quality the food- delicious
so much flavor pack into small bite
-PRON- little girlfriend party of 4 scarf down smoke salmon toasts ceviche wonderfully tangy and fresh tuna tartare bacon wrapped dates ridiculously addictive with a happy almond crunch on the inside mac and cheese creamy and cheesy and evil and tasty albondigas lamb skewers w\/lentil chicken and chorizo stuffed mushrooms thai beef salad the surprise item and star of the evening
ridiculously good and large enough for a small meal for one
banana nutella sandwich
-PRON- do not get to try the sangria but -PRON- intend to on -PRON- next visit to vegas
-PRON- also plan on try to happy hour on for size with finger cross for a good table

-PRON- take -PRON- drink order and -PRON- have the white sangria which be light fresh and sweet
-PRON- order the roasted corn pizza which be mozzarella goat cheese roasted corn and basil and -PRON- be fantastic
-PRON- thursday lunch spot 5 week out of 4
-PRON- mean -PRON- can not beat the free side and drink lunch combo
try the brisket sandwich or the pork
or try anything else
-PRON- be always top notch
the food be incredible
the portion be huge and therefore worth the price
-PRON- have the prix fix menu which include -PRON- choice of appetizer entree and -PRON- coconut flan
-PRON- have the ceviche and taquito entree- yum
the margaritas be also on point
would definitely recommend
great at a good price especially for the quality variety
also very good service from garrett -PRON- recommendation be terrific

when pay -PRON- be give a reward card
after 10 appointment the 11th be free
-PRON- have a feeling that card be go to fill up sooner than -PRON- think
so -PRON- be check out with the cashier and this random employee be poke around grab thing out -PRON- cart rearrange item really just get in the way of both the cashier and bagger
-PRON- be mildly annoy but figure if -PRON- do not bother -PRON- then -PRON- should leave -PRON- be
glad
-PRON- do because turn out
-PRON- notice -PRON- daughter and -PRON- and decide to walk -PRON- out with an umbrella to -PRON- car so -PRON- do not get completely soak
even load the grocery and take the cart when -PRON- be do
what exceptional customer service
so glad -PRON- be just around the corner
-PRON- will be frequent -PRON- often
-PRON- be an over critical person sometimes with this co but -PRON- have -PRON- favs
when -PRON- pay 5.00 for coffee
-PRON- just want -PRON- right and maybe full
and oh -PRON- can skip the crack lid
glad -PRON- lid see that before -PRON- cause -PRON- grief
ill try -PRON- once more and see that will be a good test
-PRON- be a big fan of ethiopian food
go here for a dinner with some friend and -PRON- be a great decision
if -PRON- go on saturday night make sure -PRON- call in and make a reservation.(get busy
this time around -PRON- order the zoma special combo and -PRON- share with one other person
more than enough food for 2 people
for an appetizer -PRON- get the sambusa which be pretty good as well
the main course serve on top injera bread of course have a very good selection
-PRON- favorite be the spicy beef stew and the cabbage
the waitstaff be very attentive and great service be offer
-PRON- will say for the amount of food -PRON- receive -PRON- be bit expensive though
overall -PRON- would visit this restaurant again in the future
go today with 2 gal pal with a jetsetter coupon $ 135 for a massage and facial
from book to check out -PRON- have a great time
the morning of the appointment -PRON- receive a call say -PRON- facialist call in sick and -PRON- apologize profusely
-PRON- give -PRON- the option of cancel or a body scrub upgrade from a facial
since -PRON- be in town for only a couple of day -PRON- choose the scrub
-PRON- admit when -PRON- arrive at the spa -PRON- be already a bit ticked off but the moment -PRON- hit the reception desk -PRON- mood change
the receptionist apologize again and the manager justin appear and do as well
-PRON- be then greet by two lovely lady who give -PRON- a tour of the spa
-PRON- have be to more glamorous large and perhaps more upscale spa but -PRON- have never feel more welcome
the facility be very clean well stock and easy to navigate
-PRON- massage be amazing and -PRON- scrub very good
lunch at the restaurant across the hall be delicious
-PRON- highly recommend this spa
not pretentious or stuffy
the staff all the way around be 5 star
skinnyfats be a really fun place to eat
the menu be divide into the healthy side and the happy side
-PRON- have choose from both side -PRON- husband and daughter only choose from the happy side
the menu state the calorie count for the healthy side but not for the happy side
maybe if -PRON- know how many calorie the happy side have -PRON- would not choose much from that side
-PRON- do not know
some people do not care about that when -PRON- go out
at any rate -PRON- have something cool for everyone
sometimes -PRON- have item that be not on the menu
-PRON- be on the wall show on the little tv screen where -PRON- wait in line to place -PRON- order
this be gourmet type food with non gourmet price
the entree be $ 7-$14
-PRON- husband like -PRON- soda make with cane sugar
some people get excited about that
-PRON- be interesting flavor not just the regular coke and sprite type
-PRON- do not get the juice because -PRON- do not want to spend a lot of money on a drink
the cookie be very good
in -PRON- opinion the good of the healthy side be the steakation
yummy really and truly
last time -PRON- order something call pilgrimamedic not sure of the title
-PRON- be just for november
sooo good
turkey ham on a waffle make of corn bread stuffing ingredient with fry green bean with some cranberry sauce with an over easy egg on top cover with some hollandaise type sauce and a few sugar cranberry
wow
-PRON- taste bud be very happy
not sure what side that be from
probably the happy side
-PRON- just discover that -PRON- have the breakfast menu all day
-PRON- be go to try that next time
the decor be interesting
-PRON- have tv which do not make -PRON- happy
apparently some people can not survive without tv every waking hour
the staff be very pleasant and -PRON- seem happy which be good
-PRON- have some booth bar seating near the kitchen and a huge table in the middle that multiple party can sit at with chunky barstool that be hard to move and not extremely comfortable
-PRON- would rather sit at a booth but -PRON- do not have many of those
-PRON- also have a little outdoor enclose eat area
-PRON- do have some free standing table with chair near the front window which be not very invite or cosy
all in all this be a fun place to go when -PRON- do not want to spend too much money and -PRON- have people who have different taste desire
-PRON- bring out of towner here when -PRON- visit
freshly juic right before -PRON- eye
-PRON- about $ 4 for a juice which be a bit pricey but just think about how much -PRON- cost for -PRON- starbucks drink
much more healthy
since -PRON- do juice -PRON- right in front of -PRON- -PRON- may have to wait a bit
-PRON- have a few juice that -PRON- can order straight up i get the one with beet i forget the name
but -PRON- be good
-PRON- have beet carrot celery cilantro and apple
-PRON- can also build -PRON- own juice and just tell -PRON- what -PRON- want in -PRON-
-PRON- offer shot of wheat grass and also ginger + wheat grass in 1 and 2 oz serving -PRON- be locate right next to steve 's gyro
so while -PRON- be wait in that epic line -PRON- can grab a freshly squeeze juice to sip
and right behind -PRON- be the popcorn stand where -PRON- can grab a few sample
i think one area of improvement be that -PRON- could add ice into -PRON- juice
just be refrigerate the fruit and veggie be not cold enough for the juice to be as refreshing as -PRON- could be
also a plus be that -PRON- take credit card
many place in westside market be cash only
save -PRON- cash
use plastic

-PRON- be not from here
but -PRON- come to visit family and decide -PRON- need to get -PRON- eyebrow thread
-PRON- be nervous because -PRON- be use to get -PRON- do from back home
but -PRON- be very much need to get do
when -PRON- go to get -PRON- eyebrow thread here
-PRON- be very happy with how -PRON- turn out
usually -PRON- cry during the process but that be not the case when -PRON- get -PRON- do here
the lady be very kind and very patient
-PRON- will definitely come back if -PRON- be ever in the area again
-PRON- wish i could live here forever
the service here from the spa to the bar be exceptional
-PRON- really enjoy -PRON- stay and the view from every corner of the resort be the beautiful
day or night the color of -PRON- setting really stand out
at night the pool light up pink purple and blue
jade bar of course have green decor
this be also a great place to check out the sunset which arizona be know for
-PRON- do not get the chance to take advantage of -PRON- but -PRON- love that -PRON- provide bath salt
-PRON- stay in a mountain casita and the room be very open and invite
there be even a window that open from the bathroom over the bathtub that look into the sleep area
amazing service

10\/10 would recommend to anyone

thank lvac for look out for -PRON- member and hire this guy joey

2.5\/5 the food here be simply ok
the sushi be anything but fresh bordering on questionable
-PRON- chop up lobster chunk be plentiful and decent
the hot shrimp be probably -PRON- favorite thing
the spicy chicken be actually spicy
the beef be terrible as expect at a seafood place
the soft serve dessert be too icy
no one get sick and the service be good for what be
3 month ago
second time come here and will not be last
both time -PRON- have the gyros with fry and the gyro be amazing
never have one before so this place have set the bar high
the lamb be very season and cut in thin strip and the fry be cut thick almost like wedge
service be very accommodate -PRON- remember -PRON- order and clue -PRON- in on just how to pronounce gyro yee ro
truly a hidden gem but -PRON- get the feeling -PRON- have a loyal customer base
if -PRON- go make sure to order extra sauce for -PRON- gyro
come here with a group from work
-PRON- have reservation
well -PRON- mean -PRON- be suppose to
when -PRON- show up -PRON- have no idea who -PRON- be or what -PRON- reservation be
-PRON- reservation be for 5 by the time -PRON- check -PRON- in arrange the table for -PRON- -PRON- be almost 5:30
there be not a lot of people in this restaurant and the service be very slow
-PRON- really be not on top of -PRON-
when -PRON- finally do get some drink one of -PRON- girl drink that be bring out have lipstick on -PRON-
full on lip imprint on the glass when -PRON- mention -PRON- to the waitress -PRON- tell -PRON- all to check -PRON- cup

appetizer be good but overall a lot of -PRON- will not be return
-PRON- have be to quite a few baseball game over the year at the rogers centre skydome but this review be for the behind the scene roger centre tour
-PRON- only do the behind the scene tour periodically so make sure to check online to see what day be available
-PRON- go on a sunday and be promptly on time to buy -PRON- ticket
at first -PRON- seem like -PRON- would be a small group but then the crowd come -PRON- have a huge group with -PRON- include a group who be late
-PRON- tour guide be very eccentric and funny
-PRON- take -PRON- on a great tour full of information and hide fact about the dome
-PRON- also take -PRON- to some special area -PRON- be not suppose to because -PRON- miss out on the good part of the tour get to walk on the field
yes
the good part of the tour that -PRON- be look forward to the most -PRON- be not allow to do thank to the group of people practise for the pan am game not impressed
-PRON- also only find that out when -PRON- get there the day of because -PRON- do not bother list additional information on the website
-PRON- party do indeed have a good time -PRON- get to experience part of the dome that most visitor do not get the opportunity to be in\/see
-PRON- guide be fantastic -PRON- be funny full of information and kinda kooky which -PRON- think help make -PRON- tour more exciting
-PRON- give 3.5\/5 due to the fact that -PRON- wish -PRON- could have get to go on the field and wish there be update information on the website as to not have disappoint visitor
oh p.s go to the roger centre website to print off a $ 1 off coupon
the venue -PRON- be pretty nice
but
after spend $ 40 to get in who know how much on drink -PRON- would not serve -PRON- a glass of water
-PRON- only have bottle water for $ 6\/each which be pretty ridiculous when a mixed drink be $ 7
when -PRON- ask the bartender why -PRON- say -PRON- be part of -PRON- contract -PRON- can only sell water
-PRON- be a shame because the venue be very nice but the service be definitely poor
this be kind of late
but as -PRON- prev review say
diane will keep do the face painting at any bday party -PRON- have for -PRON- son
-PRON- be amazing
-PRON- love -PRON- work -PRON- personality while paint not paint
-PRON- liven up the party make even adult want to get -PRON- face paint
frickin awesome
-PRON- like the original terry track suit but those be like so 5 year ago
besides the girl sell out and who can blame -PRON- to liz claiborn or some other mass producer
these clothe be probably make in china now
no thank
every time -PRON- have take a car to firestone -PRON- have to take -PRON- back
-PRON- always tell -PRON- -PRON- be something else and more money
-PRON- be do with this place
-PRON- really do believe -PRON- rip -PRON- off
-PRON- tell -PRON- that and -PRON- could care less
enough chance
never go -PRON- ever again
one of the better assemble greek chicken pita 's -PRON- have have in awhile
all the usual suspect be involve but the chicken be spice and slice perfectly and tuck into a pita wrap with good dill sauce lettuce and other veggie
the pita come with hot fry and be serve by the nice female owner of the place
this be a random stop while work one day in the area
this be the only time -PRON- feel bad a restaurant be not a chain because -PRON- be far from east valley
-PRON- only cost seven buck too and most patron be talk greek so -PRON- know -PRON- be eat in the right place
just buy -PRON- second car from gaudin porsche and the experience be great
the team share a passion for the car just test driving and shopping be a great experience
the transaction be effortless get the car and the deal -PRON- want
-PRON- will be back

-PRON- have such a great selection if burger that be all amazing
the wagyu beef be phenomenal
-PRON- should try the truffle parmesan fry

-PRON- be wonderful either with -PRON- meal or as a dessert
overall -PRON- should try this restaurant
-PRON- be a very good experience
sometimes the service be slow but overall the experience be always great
so -PRON- call to place to place an order
and -PRON- put -PRON- on hold
-PRON- be take too long so -PRON- drive down there to just order -PRON- but stay on the phone
-PRON- order there and wait and get -PRON- food there
but -PRON- just keep the phone unhooked the whole time when -PRON- order in person
then -PRON- take -PRON- friend order behind -PRON- and forget to take -PRON- money
then -PRON- pick up the phone and hang -PRON- up in front of -PRON- face

-PRON- must try the mizithra cheese if -PRON- have never have -PRON-
mmmm
the pie be amazing
do not have anything bad to say about the pie
-PRON- friend get fry and -PRON- be also good
the 2 bad thing be -PRON- be run out of pie and the pie be a little small than -PRON- think -PRON- would be
but the pie be definitely worth try
this place be great
-PRON- be basically like chipotle but mediterranean
-PRON- have always say the next big chain\/franchise be go to be a mediterranean and this place have the potential of be that restaurant
everything just make sense
cheer to the staff that know how to maintain control of the customer that seem to be disorganize and not really stand in an organize line
-PRON- do -PRON- job and get -PRON- order out in good fashion
-PRON- can not expect -PRON- to be exit to be deal with drunk partier and gambler but -PRON- really do a good job
as for the food
-PRON- be mcdonald 's
-PRON- serve the purpose
the wine waitress use a trapeze to fetch -PRON- choice from the tower of 2300 available selection
again quieter than the competition
this lush setting serve excellent fois gra with strawberry compote rabbit agnalotti new york strip with a semi ~ offensive chimichurri rub and duck breast
pampered pet on wheel be a great alternative to take -PRON- pet to the groomer
-PRON- be slightly more expensive than bring -PRON- cat somewhere
but -PRON- be 1000 worth -PRON-
-PRON- kitty be petrify of the carrier car ride and entire grooming experience so much that -PRON- would foam at the mouth pee in the cage and throw up for a week after a trip there
-PRON- know there have to be an alternative
so -PRON- call pampered pet
-PRON- be able to get an appt for the following week and -PRON- show up right on time at -PRON- house nd ready to work
ashley be polite and super understanding for -PRON- need to usher -PRON- cat into the van and pet -PRON- for a while to reassure -PRON-
-PRON- come back exactly an hour later as promise with -PRON- little baby wrap in a towel and -PRON- be totally calm and not meow
-PRON- look and smell great too
-PRON- be so happy with the service -PRON- receive from pampered pet
-PRON- be so professional from start to finish
and finally -PRON- have some piece of mind know there be a way to groom -PRON- cat without traumatize -PRON-
will definitely be use -PRON- again
oh damn
this place be in a pretty innocuous look building save for the blue roof
just outside downtown mesa
a very casual atmosphere that be desolate at 4:30 but fill up entirely before 5:30
-PRON- serve a sleepy dog beer yay local
but that be one more than -PRON- usually see on tap
-PRON- order the carne adobado adovada here -PRON- know how spanish be and -PRON- moms have the taos plate which come with a chile relleno and a bunch of other thing that be unidentifiable under a blanket of cheese not always a bad thing
the food come out within 20 minute and be pip hot
-PRON- could not have be any good
the last chill in arizona before the swelter really start have just hit so the moment be perfect for something spicy
the adobado be basically cube of pork in a spicy\/powdery sauce with rice and bean on the side so -PRON- can make mini tortilla out of the stuff
the pork be that fall apart slow cook type that take year to master
the server do not seem to care much for -PRON- the guy could not smile -PRON- swear but the boston marathon bombing have just happen so maybe -PRON- be affect but -PRON- be quick and helpful
the price point here be two dollar sign but the adobado be really only one 10.95
oh before -PRON- forget -PRON- be one of those rare mexican place that still give -PRON- free chip and a tasty chipotle salsa
-PRON- have be to multiple vet office in the past with -PRON- kid but have never love any of -PRON- as much as -PRON- do baseline animal clinic
-PRON- find baseline animal clinic after -PRON- cat have a broken tooth and be look for a vet office with reasonable pricing
this place may have have the cheap price but -PRON- never expect -PRON- to be so valuable to -PRON-
dr. fitch as well as the other doctor and staff have be so sympathetic care and helpful every time -PRON- be there
recently -PRON- cat have be have some problem that result in a very serious infection
all of the staff have show sincere concern for -PRON- and -PRON- cat
dr. finch have be very great about help -PRON- get the treatment need without drain -PRON- bank account
-PRON- do very good at explain the situation and all of -PRON- option and explain why -PRON- recommend one option over the other
most recently -PRON- be debate get some lab work to determine the type of infection but dr. finch decide that -PRON- would not provide clear result due to the extent of bacteria and infection and -PRON- just be not worth the cost in this case when -PRON- could just as easily and much more cheaply use -PRON- experience and knowledge to choose the good treatment
any other vet -PRON- have ever meet would have make -PRON- spend the money for lab work even if -PRON- think the chance be very small of get some helpful result
after go to baseline animal clinic -PRON- will not trust -PRON- kid live to anybody else
-PRON- would highly recommend baseline animal clinic to anybody that be look for a wonderful vet office that will take the good care of -PRON- pet make -PRON- feel comfortable and not rob -PRON- blind

service be speedy\/friendly as well
the shopping and available item be good
the checkout experience have be less than satisfactory during -PRON- last 3 shopping experience

-PRON- would like to have do -PRON- cheap but several other place that -PRON- try to have to do do not have the correct tool
-PRON- do however change the battery in one of -PRON- cheap watch for $ 20
so -PRON- guess the premium price be for the premium watch
-PRON- would not have mind pay extra for the premium if -PRON- do extra stuff like to give the watch new gasket etc but no such luck
where -PRON- be raise red italian be the default restaurant type so -PRON- take a lot to impress -PRON-

still in a socal state of mind if there be an earthquake in charlotte

now only if -PRON- could remember where -PRON- park

-PRON- be that good
service be good
-PRON- cost about $ 10 less the burgr
-PRON- burger be perfect be not burn
los dos molinos be locate near -PRON- hotel so -PRON- drive there one night without know much about the restaurant
-PRON- love -PRON- when -PRON- be not particularly expect anything and the food turn out to be quite delicious
-PRON- do not think the salsas to be that hot as some have mention but -PRON- like -PRON- food quite hot
the service be friendly and efficient
very large serving and quite reasonable for what -PRON- get
and -PRON- certainly enjoy a couple of large margaritas
-PRON- be a huge fan of thai food and -PRON- literally eat here every time -PRON- be in town
the service be great and food be on point
love this place
-PRON- be a no frill great price awesome food kind of place
the red yellow or green curry be -PRON- jam
and -PRON- have a lunch special for $ 5.95
$ 10 lunch special and great service
will come again
the place be decorate with vintage book that -PRON- can read and the decor be adorable
if -PRON- be pathetic enough to have follow -PRON- yelp review for any length of time yes -PRON- be talk about -PRON- mom -PRON- probably be sick of -PRON- review the taverne of richfield
-PRON- have probably review -PRON- a half dozen time each episode precipitate by another change in ownership or a new chef
-PRON- be open
-PRON- be closed
-PRON- be open again
the magic formula of how to separate the people of richfield from -PRON- money have elude this place time and time again
fortunately -PRON- have be there each step of the way to make lewd irreverent comment on the whole fiasco
so -PRON- really hope this will be -PRON- last review of the taverne
-PRON- certainly will be the most positive
enter chef jeff fisher formerly of touch supper club
finally finally a bona fide talent in the kitchen
a chef and -PRON- cuisine worthy of ye grande olde taverne
the new summer menu for the taverne be release today
-PRON- be the most exciting menu anywhere around these part
jeff have formalize -PRON- influence on the direction the restaurant be head and the prospect be exciting
the flaccid ken stewart 's empire with -PRON- virtual monopoly on fine dining in the bath\/richfield\/peninsula\/hinckley complex would be advise to take notice
locavore will find plenty to rejoice in here with a healthy injection of locally source and seasonal food throughout the new menu
jeff proudly bring out -PRON- amish bee honeycomb to show -PRON- for the new menu 's almond panna cotta with honeycomb dessert
kick ass dude
-PRON- also like to feature wild food such a freshly harvest wild leek when -PRON- be in season
the menu entree be mostly classic steak chop seafood and pasta but each with a unique mediterranean- or asian inspire twist
-PRON- be perform a nice balancing act by give the taverne 's traditional crowd something basically familiar but often with a bold new ingredient to ponder while also give young foodie and locavor something to drool over too
-PRON- think of -PRON- cooking as be straightforward fresh and bold
there be usually not a lot of complex layering of flavor go on
nothing too foofy
but -PRON- be always well execute and flavorful
if -PRON- sound like a bit of wonk well the man cater a party of mine a few week ago and -PRON- have be basically eat -PRON- frozen leftover every day since then so yes guilty as charge
-PRON- be like -PRON- surrogate mother
last night -PRON- sample the new menu and order the lobster gnocchi
-PRON- usually stay away from shellfish\/seafood\/pasta combination because -PRON- can be awful when poorly execute but this be like a deliciously deconstruct lobster bake with the potato gnocci and corn provide a preview taste of summer and blister tomato punctuate -PRON- with freshness
-PRON- be hearty without be heavy
a real plate licker
-PRON- finish up with goat cheese ice cream and orange olive oil cake with blueberry compote
yes -PRON- say goat cheese ice cream
chef jeff clearly have an unhealthy obsession with goat and -PRON- lactation
there be goat cheese everywhere on the menu all course especially dessert
although this goat centric worldview not a characteristic -PRON- would desire in for example a brother in law -PRON- be something to be treasure when -PRON- come to a chef
-PRON- love goat cheese
-PRON- be versatile as hell and -PRON- make dish come alive
the goat cheese ice cream start sweet like a golden vanilla but trail off with that distinct goat cheese flavor give -PRON- dessert a savory quality that allow -PRON- to pair very nicely with any red wine imaginable
if -PRON- have get half a glass of cabernet leftover after -PRON- be do with -PRON- steak -PRON- will not be waste on this dessert
very smart
throughout all these up and down and mostly down in the kitchen over the past few year -PRON- be the taverne building -PRON- that have remain the consistent attraction
the historical old victorian always provide a sense of elegance and tradition that be hard to find elsewhere
the bar and patio remain the most popular spot within the taverne with a friendly and boisterous energy during the evening
-PRON- be a little country elegance in shaq ville
tremont hipster
take a break from inhale those airborne industrial pollutant and come out here and breathe some fresh air in richfield where horse and cow live together in sin and ice cream be make from goat
-PRON- will not regret the trip
-PRON- be in dire need of training in the beginning beginning of june
but -PRON- think -PRON- be get more comfy now
if -PRON- be go to go go during lunch and call in -PRON- order
most thing take 20 25 min to make
-PRON- usually call in to go from the 5 dollar lunch menu during the weekday
-PRON- fav pepperoni pizza give -PRON- awful gas in the afternoon tho lol a tradeoff or the meatball half hogi serve with chip
-PRON- have be consistently good
veggie pizza be tasty as well but -PRON- only put itty bitty bit of topping on the lunch portion pizza -PRON- mostly crust lol first time -PRON- do not pick up the phone
-PRON- hang up call again in about 10 min
-PRON- be put on a length hold after -PRON- do finally pick up
food take about 20 25 min to make once the order be place
-PRON- keep the food warm even if -PRON- be run late so -PRON- think that be kinda cool
usually the staff be friendly
depend who -PRON- get
but so far most of -PRON- have be very nice
-PRON- do not drink soda
but -PRON- have 99 cent refill if -PRON- bring -PRON- mellow mushroom cup
good sushi and noodle in concord
the ginger miso be -PRON- favorite
the service and location be wonderful as well
danielle take great care of -PRON- for -PRON- party table chair and linen
-PRON- find delanie 's pricing to be competitive the communication fantastic and the service to be excellent
-PRON- would highly recommend -PRON- for -PRON- table and chair rental
-PRON- be get really confused when -PRON- walk around pacific mall
-PRON- know how -PRON- be when -PRON- walk around and -PRON- start talk to -PRON-
do -PRON- just walk by this place
fruity juice bar could be call juice bars as there be at least 3 locations+ inside pacific mall
if -PRON- be into mango -PRON- be in for a treat
mango\/mango coconut\/mango with aloe vera\/mango lychee with free tapioca\/popp
boba\/jelly -PRON- wonder when -PRON- go to have durian special
bravo
spend a few night here during thanksgiving 2016
one of the fine pet friendly hotel -PRON- have stay hand down
the staff at every iteration be professional bright faced and helpful especially when try to select open local diner after the turkey trot
the room be a mix of modern contemporary\/mid century modern and the king sized bed in -PRON- room be clean comfortable and there be no sign of previous pet in the room
as a result of this stay -PRON- sign up for the kimpton loyalty card---
-PRON- have be to several kimpton 's
but this be -PRON- favorite
and -PRON- have everything to do with the staff and little attention to detail
thank schofield
-PRON- do not need to go to a fancy casino restaurant on the strip for 5 star dining
this place exceed -PRON- expectation
classy professional care over the top service
excellent
-PRON- friend and -PRON- visit this place last week
-PRON- order the cold capellini and the eggplant poutine
-PRON- could not try the eggplant poutine
but -PRON- hear -PRON- be pretty good
in term of the cold capellini this be a completely vegan dish 95 sure of that and taste like a noodle salad with rice krispies on top
the crunch of the rice combine with the soft\/tangy noodle go well together
-PRON- believe this be $ 6
for $ 6 -PRON- be expect one small bowl as tapas place be pretty expensive
however -PRON- get 3 decent size bowl which imo would have be a good lunch
as for the service the server be very friendly and willing to answer all question -PRON- have
-PRON- also have some mocktail which be pretty cool but -PRON- do not order any
overall very good
designer fabric be -PRON- go to mostly because of the location but -PRON- also do tend to have what -PRON- be look for most of the time for reasonable price
if -PRON- want a staff member to help -PRON- make decision and show -PRON- around -PRON- be probably good somewhere else but -PRON- appreciate be leave alone to touch fabric
-PRON- good selection be in home decor fabric and cotton shirting everything else can be a bit hit or miss
-PRON- mostly sew apparel and find -PRON- selection of knit be not that great
-PRON- have an excellent trim notion section with every width colour of bias tape elastic ribbon and more as well as a decent button selection and any notion -PRON- may need
great food for an amazing bargain especially in the downtown area
-PRON- have a real authentic japanese home style flavour to all of -PRON- dish and -PRON- just keep come back for more
-PRON- curry udon noodle be amazing cook perfectly with the right mixture and texture of curry with the beef and the potato
-PRON- always come out sizzle hot and -PRON- find -PRON- order this dish every time -PRON- drop by here
-PRON- green tea cheese cake be also not bad for the price
but -PRON- do find -PRON- a bit bitter compare to the other green tea cheese cake that -PRON- have have
the staff be friendly and polite and -PRON- do a great job make sure -PRON- experience be as good -PRON- can be
overall this be a very affordable and amazing place for authentic japanese home style food
however -PRON- do get a bit hot during the summer time but -PRON- can get the take out menu as well
another great trip to amel 's
-PRON- have the vegetarian grape leave this time and -PRON- definitely prefer -PRON- over the traditional meat one
-PRON- be not say the meat one be bad -PRON- just prefer the creamy rice filling in mine with a squirt of lemon juice on top so light and delicious
the only thing that kind of bug -PRON- be that when -PRON- get the grape leaf the waitress very kindly explain that appetizer be half off with purchase of an entree -PRON- guess a happy hour special
-PRON- enjoy -PRON- so much that -PRON- decide to get another order of -PRON- to go for tomorrow 's lunch and -PRON- say -PRON- have to charge -PRON- full price since -PRON- be get -PRON- to go
huh
kind of odd to -PRON-
but -PRON- still agree to purchase -PRON-
-PRON- so have the caesar salad and the gyro platter-
-PRON- really enjoy -PRON- but wish -PRON- come with a dollop of hummus as -PRON- would have love that with -PRON- gyro
-PRON- also think perhaps -PRON- should come with a bit more pita to build -PRON- own gyro
as soon as -PRON- ask the waitress bring more free of charge
-PRON- also think that $ 8 for a side caesar salad -PRON- do not add cheese -PRON- get a ton of feta on -PRON- salad
so -PRON- give -PRON- some be a bit much-
-PRON- agree
-PRON- need to have good price for -PRON- side salads- although -PRON- be delicious and great quality ingredient -PRON- be not the size of an entree salad so -PRON- should not have be $ 8 in -PRON- opinion
-PRON- get the mediterranean angel pasta again -PRON- just have to see if -PRON- be as good as -PRON- remember and if even possible -PRON- be good
this time -PRON- have a bunch of fresh herb sprinkle on top which just add to the freshness and vibrancy of this heavenly dish
-PRON- have to give this place a try
-PRON- food be fresh and vibrant and the decor in the dining room be awesome
the sushi be great and -PRON- really appreciate -PRON- waitress let -PRON- sit for over an hour as -PRON- work on a project
-PRON- be very kind and explain the different dish to -PRON-
-PRON- be even able to try one or 2 since -PRON- have never venture away from -PRON- usual dish
ugh
-PRON- be 10 p.m. and -PRON- want a bite after the flight
-PRON- be the first place -PRON- stop by and -PRON- lie to -PRON- and say -PRON- be the only place open
the place look really cool
-PRON- be airy and light and have a really cool glass water fall
unfortunately the food be slightly soggy and not what -PRON- be expect for the price
-PRON- could not seat -PRON- in the section -PRON- want by the really cool water fixture
service be very slow
-PRON- have to ask for the side of berry -PRON- waffle be suppose to come with
hopefully -PRON- will get -PRON- act together and make a cafe worthy of that glorious space
-PRON- stay 4 night here for -PRON- 25th anniversary
-PRON- be not sure what to expect since review be all over the place
-PRON- get in early around 10 and -PRON- be able to check -PRON- in early and put -PRON- on 16th floor
the bed be really comfy
the pillow be great -PRON- usually do not like hotel pillow
-PRON- have a frig -PRON- could put stuff in a liquor store close by
walking distance to strip
one block away
the gift shop be really cute too
-PRON- husband like playing blackjack here the good
-PRON- say dealer be really nice
would definitely stay again
-PRON- stay at aria for two night this past weekend
the building be very very big and difficult to get around
-PRON- feel a little too seclude from the rest of the strip even though in theory -PRON- be right next to many other place -PRON- take forever to walk out of the resort to the actual strip
-PRON- also feel very nickel and dim during -PRON- stay but maybe this be just vegas
-PRON- can not use the fridge in -PRON- room
if -PRON- do put anything inside of -PRON- -PRON- will be charge $ 25\/day
there be sensor inside the fridge so if -PRON- touch anything inside of -PRON- -PRON- will be charge
-PRON- also can not touch any of the snack on the table because -PRON- too have sensor and be insanely overpriced $ 30 for chocolate
-PRON- do have a note next to the fridge and snack that indicate this so thankfully -PRON- do not get swindle
there be no coffee pot in the room so -PRON- have to buy extremely overpriced coffee from -PRON- restaurant
honestly when -PRON- pay this much for a room -PRON- expect to at least have coffee available in the room and access to the fridge
-PRON- order room service one night and the food be not the good and really over price
the mattress in -PRON- room be very soft so -PRON- do not sleep very well
but if -PRON- enjoy soft mattress -PRON- will be fine
the staff however be incredibly nice and helpful
the theatre be also great -PRON- see zarkana and -PRON- be spectacular
-PRON- daughter have lunch here on monday base on many recommendation from friend of -PRON- school nearby and -PRON- tell -PRON- how friendly the owner be to -PRON- and -PRON- friend
-PRON- say that -PRON- give -PRON- an empanada on the house
-PRON- be think do -PRON- look low on $ or be -PRON- super nice
-PRON- be sure -PRON- be the latter
-PRON- love the service and say the food be amazing
-PRON- husband and -PRON- decide to try -PRON- tonight and -PRON- be exactly as describe
the food be outstanding
-PRON- prefer baked empanada the way -PRON- make -PRON- at home but these be sinfully good
the jalepeño popper be -PRON- absoulte fave
service be a little chaotic once -PRON- get busy but -PRON- be still very good
next time -PRON- visit -PRON- will bring -PRON- own sweet n low or stevia since -PRON- do not carry -PRON- for tea
otherwise perfect visit
-PRON- have be to this location before but today be a series of unfortunate event and no other than on fathers day
-PRON- understand there be
longer wait time
but when -PRON- see other party still be call before -PRON- be odd
-PRON- be very observant of who be here and and what time -PRON- check in
-PRON- be a party of ten for the grill table
-PRON- check in exactly at 7:30pm and get seat at 845-ish
the chef do not get to -PRON- table until exactly 9:30
understandable -PRON- be last group to be serve and every staff member be probably exhaust by the long day but nevertheless the waitress spill the platter of water on -PRON- father
-PRON- shrimp plate become a shrimp soup
-PRON- also forget to mention the fork have rice in -PRON- when -PRON- be seat
disappointed not come here again anymore
bad place ever
bad bad service
ass


work the bar friday night the 22nd have a bad attitude should not be work in customer related field
i order a meal and request something to add on to -PRON- meal and -PRON- respond what
what be -PRON- talk about
i throw -PRON- the menu and tell -PRON- to read -PRON- and -PRON- know -PRON- be wrong
after i tell -PRON- i be go to pay after i get -PRON- meal -PRON- say -PRON- need a credit card
and i say no -PRON- be pay cash
so i get -PRON- upset regard that which i enjoy after that -PRON- say -PRON- be in control of the food
in short -PRON- mean -PRON- can f

with -PRON- food or spit in -PRON-
i could not believe -PRON-
when i get -PRON- food i do not eat -PRON- and throw -PRON- on the floor and have -PRON- ass clean -PRON- up
i will never forget this bad experience
true japanese curry and raman
try the katsu
this be the only play -PRON- have find so far that have good japanese curry
love sushi
love poke to be more precise
get that crave for that hawaiian local flavor but live in the desert of sin city far far away from the fresh ocean
look no further than poke express -PRON- one stop shop for poke variety and then some
-PRON- honestly do not think there be any other place like poke express that offer the variety or poke and other seafood rawness fresh with flavor
sure there be sushi place in town and ayce buffet that offer a little bit of poke but nothing like this
if the idea of fresh raw delicacy be not -PRON- fancy this place may not be -PRON- thing
but -PRON- do not think -PRON- would be read this review if -PRON- do not fancy -PRON-
pretty much every choice be a hit maker
-PRON- favorite be the spicy mayo ahi and spicy mayo salmon though -PRON- have to request -PRON- for the salmon with no problem at all
ahi limu be subtle but great
eat -PRON- as is or with rice as a meal or -PRON- favorite side dish for snack
price can get up there with all the choice as per pound can be around $ 14.99 come in with a military -PRON- would can receive $ 2.00 off and if -PRON- buy 5 pound -PRON- believe there be a discount off es h pound as well
for what -PRON- be in the city of sinful desert -PRON- sure be close to purely poke perfection
nothing else come close in town
let alone there be nothing else
p.s. be sure to come early as -PRON- tend to run out towards end of the day and closing time on select poke especially salmon poke
dr. zedek have be -PRON- doctor for 2 year
-PRON- have 2 to 3 doctor always leave the same way -PRON- come in cry -PRON- be depressed

-PRON- give -PRON- less
2 this place be pretty expensive but -PRON- will not mind pay for the amount if -PRON- be honest with -PRON- business
3 may need to reconsider about this place 4 -PRON- always try to sell -PRON- a big size crab or lobster even though -PRON- refuse to 5

the place be rather small but -PRON- be nice and clean
-PRON- be give a japanese slaw while wait for -PRON- food

the service be excellent
-PRON- find no reason not to come back
bad mexican food -PRON- have ever have
everything from the bean and salsa to the ground beef burrito be bland and gross

-PRON- get there at maybe 6:45 or 6:50
the pizza and wing be ready to go
not sure how long -PRON- have sit there but still be warm

the restaurant be not crowd at all
so -PRON- do well on the service time
-PRON- get home and have -PRON- wing which be hot
-PRON- be use to heat -PRON- do eat jalapeno and hot wing so not a big deal
but if -PRON- do not mess up and if that be how hot and spicy there medium sauce be then beware if -PRON- can not handle the heat
wing be the wet style so have plenty of napkin ready
the guinea pizza be very good
-PRON- have sausage add as an extra and -PRON- would recommend this
-PRON- be a white sauce pizza garlic cheese and meatball too

for two grown man the 1\/4 pizza be enough food
-PRON- get too much and eat too much by get the wing
as for there not be crowd and there not be a wait time maybe -PRON- get lucky on the time and day -PRON- go
not sure
but the place look clean and the lady that get -PRON- pizza be super nice
-PRON- would go again
head out for the night and want to get a drink before the craziness begin
caramel be a decent choice
-PRON- be definitely nothing to write home about but -PRON- make -PRON- happy for one reason -PRON- be -PRON- 3rd night of madness and -PRON- priority be simple
-PRON- want a seat
-PRON- walk in after dinner and meet up with a few other girl and immediately be approach by a cocktail waitress and tell -PRON- could sit at one of -PRON- reserved table
that be music to -PRON- ear and -PRON- tired foot
-PRON- be a small lounge and the crowd be random if anything
not anywhere worth spend more than 30 minute but the music be decent and -PRON- can get some really good infuse vodka and if -PRON- be lucky a seat
parking lot be pretty hectic so -PRON- may be hard to find a space
-PRON- be sit within 5 min
decor and restaurant be nice and update
-PRON- get the blacken chicken nachos half order and -PRON- be huge
more than enough for 2 people
the queso be good and cheesy
-PRON- have black bean and pico with cut up piece of chicken
-PRON- get hot wing as -PRON- meal
flavor be good and spicy
not buttery flavor which -PRON- like
wing be medium sized
ranch be good
-PRON- fiancé get the leap year burger
-PRON- be on an english muffin large than a regular one
-PRON- have beef cheese fry egg bacon and lettuce and tomato
egg be a little runny
yolk be already drip on the burger and -PRON- seep on the bottom of the bun make -PRON- soggy
-PRON- like that the english muffin be use but say -PRON- be almost not big enough to hold everything up
-PRON- burger keep break apart
-PRON- see a manager stop by each table ask how everything be
little gesture like that show -PRON- care about -PRON- customer
tracy be -PRON- server and -PRON- be awesome and very informative about the menu
only flaw -PRON- notice be the bathroom
there be paper towel all over the floor as if -PRON- be not check for a while
other than that -PRON- would definitely go again
chris and -PRON- team be awesome
-PRON- go above and beyond an oil change for what -PRON- believe to be a very very fair price
-PRON- be knowledgeable in all that i ask about -PRON- vehicle and teach -PRON- very much
-PRON- want -PRON- vehicle in the good condition
-PRON- highly recommend chris and -PRON- team weather
-PRON- be at the durango location or the fort apache and charleston location
thank gentleman
have a great experience with the green goat
-PRON- be able to handle most everything online from the request for a quote scheduling service to make -PRON- payment
-PRON- be pretty prompt and work very efficiently
-PRON- yard look great
good indian food
the buffet on the weekend be pretty good but guru palace have more of a variety and good quality
-PRON- favorite be the chicken masala and -PRON- naan
on -PRON- 2nd trip to the buffet there be no more naan and wait around 5 10 minute and -PRON- be never refill so this be the main reason for the 3 star
oh
yeah
-PRON- chili chicken be also very good and spicy
cute little bakery tuck in the corner of a little strip mall
the lady behind the counter be so delightful and helpful
-PRON- get the flan and cream puff which be delicious
but -PRON- must admit after a while
-PRON- be custard out
-PRON- would come back and try -PRON- sandwich
bad place to ever stay at
-PRON- friend book this place for -PRON- bday
-PRON- wish -PRON- would have do the planning -PRON-
do not stay here
bad service and overprice
absolutely incredible
-PRON- love the server especially kevin
try the pasta with clam in red sauce
surprisingly good flavor
also go in and ask for the giant steak
the most tender beef in pittsburgh good than a steakhouse downtown -PRON- be on the menu with a real name but -PRON- forget what cut of beef -PRON- be
lets just call -PRON- the heaven cut
fried zucchini as an app be really fun and flavorful as well -PRON- do not just taste like pure bread like other place and the piece be the whole length of the vegetable so -PRON- be really fun to eat
great wine selection as well
-PRON- first thought be that this place be super cozy
steiner 's have all that a local pub should have- warm atmosphere and drink and food special
-PRON- be not impressed with -PRON- reuben sandwich
-PRON- be ok but lack that true reuben taste and need more dressing
good beer special that -PRON- dining mate enjoy
the place have some nice holiday décor go on
and -PRON- think -PRON- may leave some of those pretty light up year round
a solid choice for pub fare comfy atmosphere if -PRON- be in this neighborhood
-PRON- absolutely love weera thai
there be so many thai restaurant all over around vegas how do -PRON- know which one to go to
well -PRON- suggest here
-PRON- lunch special start when -PRON- open end at 3:30 pm -PRON- have all -PRON- good entree offer at this time
-PRON- get a soup salad egg roll before -PRON- meal
lot of food for the price
-PRON- have have a few different dish here
-PRON- have not be disappoint once
everything have so much flavor be fresh authentic just plain amazing
the interior be romantic calm
the waiter waitress be friendly polite fast
-PRON- thai tea be perfection
-PRON- can not have another thai tea anywhere else without wish -PRON- taste more like weera 's
which be only $ 1.50 if -PRON- add -PRON- on to -PRON- lunch special
-PRON- highly recommend give this place a shot -PRON- be not super busy like some of the other place the food be always good here
the service at clinique be horrible
the black woman who assist -PRON- be extremely rude and have no manner
-PRON- lack customer service and seem very miserable with -PRON- life
-PRON- definitely lower clinique standard have -PRON- there
-PRON- have be a customer of clinique square one for over 20 year and this kind of customer service be unacceptable
-PRON- need to get fire no wonder clinique do not sell anymore
if -PRON- be a buy customer go to clinique and come across a black tall woman with spec then turn right around and exit the bay because -PRON- will have the most rude awakening of -PRON- life speak to this small minded individual
go here for the cubs game last week
atmosphere be awesome pizza be amazing and service be great
conrad be -PRON- bartender -PRON- be super friendly and attentive
price be very reasonable
-PRON- will be back
not at all impressed
-PRON- go here for the first time with a friend who be from out of town
-PRON- be halfway greet at the door and the server be extremely rude
-PRON- ask -PRON- for -PRON- drink and then do not even ask -PRON- friend
-PRON- have to yell out what -PRON- want
-PRON- know -PRON- be busy but that be ridiculous
-PRON- keep look away as if -PRON- be talk to someone else and turn to other table as -PRON- be speak
the service be awful the atmosphere be mediocre the food be ok
the fry pickle be decent enough but not great and the burger be not season
-PRON- definitely will not be go back
the good thing about this place be the ironic name
-PRON- have charge -PRON- major money in the past
-PRON- take -PRON- 5 try to fix -PRON- ac problem
-PRON- take -PRON- girlfriend for $ 1100 to replace a compressor that have be replace just a couple of year earlier
then when -PRON- ac go bad and -PRON- want the warranty honor suddenly -PRON- be not in the system
yes -PRON- will check -PRON- air conditioning for free but then -PRON- try to hit -PRON- up for $ 200 to run fluid through -PRON- to evaluate what be wrong even before the charge of actually fix -PRON-
-PRON- walk away and find a real honest mechanic to do the whole job for just the price -PRON- want to evaluate -PRON-
honest 1 what a joke
avoid this place
this be -PRON- first visit to the plaza location -PRON- have be to the paradise location and rate that place higher just because of the ambiance
first off anything in the plaza
can not be good walk through smoky casino floor up shaky escalator take a left no a right
oh wait straight through those door up ahead
-PRON- try to go sheik and sexy with an amazing view but -PRON- think all -PRON- accomplish be a second story food court with fancy table and window to peer down on the destitute and desperate of downtown
that may be a little harsh but what -PRON- be get at be the view be not worth a star
the food be ok but probably to pricey for what -PRON- get $ 4 for 4 date and a piece of bacon
$ 7 for some shoestring fry
surf and turf skewers and calamari be probably the good item on the menu and the mojitos and sangria be solid
if -PRON- just want to get hammer on some wine and fruit in a pitcher and watch the crazy 's peep get of the grey hound this be the place
but for a good time -PRON- would hit up the paradise locale
-PRON- be go to spend the same amount of cash but at least there -PRON- will feel less like -PRON- pay for a bad vegas show
what a great find
excellent quality pizza
-PRON- order the bbq pizza but ask for buffalo sauce instead of bbq
the ingredient be amazing and fresh
the cheese pizza be super cheesy and delicious
the staff be so friendly and make -PRON- feel so welcome
pizza take 20 30 minute to make and -PRON- be worth every single minute
this be a great family own local spot and will now be a regular favorite for -PRON-
früher war mata meine lieblingskneipe
dann bin ich einpaar jahre nicht
mehr hin
irgendwann habe ich mich mit freunden wieder dort verabredet und musste feststellen dass die ganzen netten bedienungen und auch das feel weg waren
ich bin mir nicht sicher ob der chef gewechselt hat oder oder oder
wie dem auch sei
sogar der koch ist neu und das essen nicht besonder empfehlenswert
das käsefondue war ein einziger klumpen brot dazu
kam erst spät nach
die bedienung brachte falsche getränke und musste mehrmal daran erinnert werden dass wir bezahlen möchten
ich dachte dass es eine ausnahme war aber die nachkommenden
besuche waren nicht besser
für studenten ganz gut um abend und be -PRON- party zu machen
good deal for pizza in town
a large 10-slice be only $ 11.06 include tip and $ 1 delivery fee
pizza be hot and fresh come with small ranch cup for free
this be the good place to get from when -PRON- have a lot of people over just get 2 3 big decasa 's
and -PRON- will never go wrong
-PRON- will only cost -PRON- around $ 30 the delivery be fast
on the phone -PRON- will say 30 45 but normally -PRON- come around 20 30 minute
the only con -PRON- would say be when order -PRON- can get confused on the phone delay the ordering process
but that be no big deal just remember to be courteous of the worker and be patient when order
and -PRON- be sure -PRON- will come back
the service be great and the people be very nice -PRON- be a great spot
-PRON-
all
-novak
as most reviewer say -PRON- be a great show
-PRON- tip be to call the hotel mirage beforehand to get a discount price
-PRON- go through all that wait in line at bill 's then wait in line at the mirage for the actual ticket
when -PRON- get to the front the woman tell -PRON- -PRON- could get -PRON- the same deal on same day ticket
wish -PRON- have not spend so much time in line
-PRON- have have be a resident in this building for nearly 2 year now and -PRON- overall experience here have be great
-PRON- move to the arizona just over 2 year ago and need to find a place that meet -PRON- need before consider a more permanent residence in the valley
north scottsdale offer safety activity excellent dining shopping major event and access to all main roadway for driving
-PRON- be look also for a place to meet people and to have a build in social network as well as the ability to have privacy and comfort broadstone have both
the amenity be top notch although a hot tub would be a welcome addition and the maintenance staff be as good as -PRON- have experience anywhere else
the community host a number of fun event for resident that be unique and creative and be good place to socialize while do something fun
brittany gillian melecia and kate be the current office staff and be simply the fine at provide any and all service -PRON- have ask for and -PRON- lean on the a lot from everything to business support to personal need
-PRON- be always meet with a smile and be never make to feel as though -PRON- issue be too cumbersome
historically there have be a high staff turnover and not all staff be create equal so -PRON- hope this group have some longevity to -PRON-
unlike a lot of these people complain -PRON- have all good thing to say about van
-PRON- be absolutely amazing and very nice
-PRON- applaud -PRON- for not deal with bs from customer
some people complain just to get something free out of -PRON-
when -PRON- first come to van like seriously 3 year ago -PRON- specifically ask -PRON- how -PRON- want -PRON- nail
short
long
thin
thick
flare
natural?he be so gentle and unlike other nail salon -PRON- have be to van have never make -PRON- bleed
-PRON- feel sooo relaxed when -PRON- be do -PRON- nail
if -PRON- get -PRON- nail do by someone else and -PRON- do not like -PRON- be sincere with van
-PRON- will do what -PRON- can to make -PRON- good
-PRON- only make -PRON- appointment with -PRON-
staff be rude
husband and -PRON- be only 2 people in the bar and rude waitress say -PRON- would not serve -PRON-
do not want to set an expectation
here be an idea learn some manner and learn some customer service skill
this place really hit the spot
great decor and cool atmosphere
price point about right for a resort in scottsdale
quick tip if -PRON- get the resort package -PRON- come with a dessert or appetizer for free per entree
-PRON- wife get the salmon and -PRON- have the short rib
both be delicious prepare correctly and season to perfection
the short rib be tender and place on a bed of mash with veggie
the salmon be pan sear with a sauce perfect temperature and not over glaze
-PRON- have the corn queso for the appetizer and the chocolate cake for dessert
both be adequate but nothing special
-PRON- would recommend this place to anyone stay at the jw marriott
down to the important detail food have the miso ramen and -PRON- be amazing service super quick and very friendly overall great new place can not wait to go again and try the sushi
the beer selection be great and at a very reasonable price point
ps
if -PRON- like spice ask for the chili powder tasty
-PRON- can not believe -PRON- take -PRON- so long to go
the food be fantastic and well worth the price
-PRON- be fairly certain
-PRON- eat 50 dollar in filet alone
consider the fact that -PRON- have spend more money on a single steak without side at a traditional steakhouse -PRON- definitely get bang for -PRON- buck with fogo
-PRON- only complaint be base on the service
there be numerous occasion where -PRON- date and -PRON- be ready for more meat with -PRON- card flip up on the ready side and the server would come to the table next to -PRON- with -PRON- back turn to -PRON- and walk away when do
-PRON- never bother to check if -PRON- table or any other behind -PRON- be also want any
in addition -PRON- main server definitely could have use some wine training as -PRON- be not able to tell -PRON- anything about the wine -PRON- ask about
despite some poor service situation all in all -PRON- be very impressed and will be back soon
-PRON- visit recently and will not return
-PRON- order a beer for -PRON- and a glass of wine for -PRON- friend two drink total
-PRON- be there to meet new potential business associate
-PRON- wait about five minute try to pay the slack bartender girl and again before leave but be then tell -PRON- tab be take care of
-PRON- later receive an angry late night call because four drink be charge to what would have be -PRON- new friend 's tab
-PRON- go back to pintville the next day and calmly explain what happen
the bartender be defiant disrespectful and would not give -PRON- information on contact owner or management
bad decision
-PRON- have be wait a long time to try this place out
-PRON- be not able to make -PRON- to the original location but make -PRON- to there new location here in mississauga
the new location have a big but busy parking lot
first impression clean
the staff be friendly and very responsive
there specialty be gook dish no pun intend but -PRON- decide to go for the table cook bbq pork belly donkatsu bulgogi fried dumplings and pbs
the staff be so responsive
-PRON- assist -PRON- in cook the pork belly when -PRON- be all to busy chat
so nice of -PRON-
the restaurant also have several private booth for those shy people
lol
-PRON- also have to add that -PRON- restaurant be baby friendly
the staff be quick to refill empty banchan dish and remove finished plate
-PRON- be outside vaping when the owner of the restaurant calvin approach -PRON- and stick up a conversation
-PRON- turn out that -PRON- have mutual friend
nice guy
as for the stand out dish that -PRON- eat -PRON- have to say that the pork belly be delicious and -PRON- have by far one of the tasty fried mandu in the gta
unfortunately -PRON- no longer serve steam mandu
-PRON- do wish -PRON- do though
-PRON- next visit will be all about the gook dish
food be great
service be improve but not quite there yet
almost feel that -PRON- can not keep up with -PRON- table so a lot of time be spend wait for food or a drink refill
super authentic italian food
the service be really fast and friendly
-PRON- be really a hide jem in an unassum shopping center
-PRON- particularly enjoy the spaghetti in clam sauce
monday for lunch the place have mostly empty but -PRON- sit -PRON- in the corner for some reason could not see the tv screen or much of anything
have the steak and egg -PRON- be ok but the steak be medium
but -PRON- order medium rare
the server go miss in action
what a shame -PRON- be expect more from a restaurant inside the venetian hotel
delivery be 1.5 hour late
food be extremely small portion for how expensive the entree be
delivery driver do not even have a pen for -PRON- to sign the receipt
-PRON- regret tip ahead of time

friend 2 be not very happy about -PRON- pork chop
-PRON- be try to eat -PRON- because -PRON- be press for time without complain to the waitress
but the more -PRON- think about -PRON- and the price -PRON- be pay for -PRON- meal the more upset -PRON- get
so -PRON- tell the waitress who be apologetic and offer another chop
friend 3 ask how long would that take
waitress say at least 30 minute
well -PRON- do not have 30 minute
so friend 3 be leave to eat cardboard taste pork chop

manager do not mention the chop would be comp but -PRON- see -PRON- on -PRON- bill
-PRON- have be to plenty of upscale restaurant in -PRON- lifetime but never have i experience anything like this
-PRON- first experience dining at mario batali 's restaurant and -PRON- last

wth why not just let -PRON- leave after the 1st or 2nd game
fyi if ur go to hate on a cali team then do not open ur tournament to everyone
top two team ca ca
-PRON- have have hit or miss experience here
of the sandwich that be more or less permanently on -PRON- menu the chicken liver mousse one be delicious
the chicken avocado one be pretty good but -PRON- do not think the flavor of the pickle vegetable mesh well with the other flavor
-PRON- have a japanese beef and pork sandwich recently which be inventive but do not totally work for -PRON-
the rice cake add a texture to the sandwich that be a little off put and make the sandwich difficult to eat
-PRON- boyfriend try -PRON- chicken vindaloo wrap which -PRON- find to be extremely bland
-PRON- also find -PRON- difficult to eat as the wrap job for takeout seem a bit hastily do
although -PRON- have occasionally enjoy very tasty food here -PRON- feel like -PRON- would almost always rather go down the street and get a sandwich from gaucho for the same price -PRON- get a big portion and more consistently delicious food
love -PRON- selection of produce
-PRON- always have great deal on thing -PRON- love
raspberries and blackberry be only .75 and the pineapple -PRON- buy be out of this world delicious
aww yea baby
by far -PRON- second favorite costco -PRON- first favorite one be in honolulu and only because -PRON- can get macadamia
nut
hershey 's kiss
this have a gas station and though -PRON- digestive tract hat -PRON- for -PRON- a kick as cheese selection
the costco back in the 408\/415 do not hold a candle to this costco in cheese selection
-PRON- avoid any costco during -PRON- demo hour because frankly -PRON- have zero desire to be shove aside by hungry little mother with -PRON- monster kid
-PRON- detest try to maneuver around people randomly stop to chat to the demo person and have -PRON- cart block off an aisle
have some consideration ok
not all of -PRON- be there to eat
the good perk to this costco
-PRON- be less than 10 minute from -PRON- house
woo hoo
bummer -PRON- do not take other credit card because -PRON- would love to get flight mile but -PRON- be ok
-PRON- be persuade to finally get an amex and now -PRON- get back some rockin reward
-PRON- have such a great experience from the salesman to the installer
what a great company and great customer service
love that -PRON- make the product here in arizona and hire vet
thank -PRON- for -PRON- beautiful front door
-PRON- love -PRON-
the service at the bar be very good
reasonably price draft beer and good selection
-PRON- have the spare rib with cole slaw and home fry
the cole slaw be store buy
nothing special
the homefrie be good but undercooked
the rib be cook perfectly
browned and tender
the rib be well sauce but the sauce be bland to -PRON-
-PRON- would give 4 star if -PRON- have like the sauce more
-PRON- favourite taco be bulgogi not because -PRON- be familiar with the taste but -PRON- have the most flavour to -PRON-
do not mean other taco be bad -PRON- be all good
-PRON- be a quite big establishment with a high ceiling so -PRON- almost feel like -PRON- be eat outside
-PRON- start with guac + chip
-PRON- have to say those chip be not the good -PRON- have have
some of -PRON- be too thick so -PRON- be hard to eat
guac be okay nothing special about -PRON-
one thing -PRON- like about wilbur mexicana be that -PRON- have this huge selection of hot sauce and salsa a self serve bar where -PRON- can just grab what -PRON- want and how much -PRON- want
all the salsas -PRON- try be pack with flavour
-PRON- highly recommend try -PRON-
taco come with chip btw
have guac+chip and more chip be a lot of chip
but there be no such thing as too much chip
overall check the place out if -PRON- be nearby
thus far -PRON- have wait over three hour to get -PRON- room
-PRON- request early check in and -PRON- have other room that be available but not for the people that be already here
this an extremely busy time
but why would -PRON- not clean the room for a guest that be here wait
-PRON- wife be in a wheelchair and need rest
-PRON- suggestion be to go to bally 's
-PRON- have have several great experience with -PRON- and check in early most time and with the room ready upon first request
-PRON- also just stay at sls las vegas and love -PRON-
great service there
-PRON- have hear numerous complaint during -PRON- wait today that yesterday be even bad
management have only two people check get in guest for 1300 + arrival and 1100 departure
people wait in line for 3 4 + hour
how be -PRON- suppose to enjoy las vegas when -PRON- can not get -PRON- room for hour on end
-PRON- wife and -PRON- be know for -PRON- patience and understanding but enough be enough
the manager here should be demote or terminate for incompetence
great for happy hour
which -PRON- have every day 5 8
-PRON- have muso soup and tuna roll
very giid
decent wine and drink special
bartender very friendly and efficient
-PRON- be always interesting to read past review like kate m. 's or georgie m. 's and feel like -PRON- have have the same experience
yet one be 4 year ago and the other 2
how could thing not have change
well -PRON- have not
first the flow
yep as kate m. say take a shot of whiskey before -PRON- walk in because if -PRON- be busy -PRON- will just pull -PRON- hair out
if -PRON- be not -PRON- will probably leave -PRON- hair alone
but -PRON- will still get that uneasy feeling inside -PRON- stomach that something just be not quite right
what be not right
quit simply the flow
-PRON- order at the far end of the counter not at the front end where -PRON- enter the store
yes there be sign post hang from the ceiling that tell -PRON- where to go
but when -PRON- walk in the door and the guy behind the counter welcome -PRON- -PRON- seem natural to just walk up and try and place -PRON- order
will not work
-PRON- be at the wrong place
sure -PRON- be kind and be more than helpful direct -PRON- down to the cash register to place -PRON- order but then -PRON- feel like an idiot and just want to get the experience over with
luckily the food and the coke freestyle machine be just moment away from wash all the bad feeling away
and do not worry about -PRON-
no one be watch -PRON-
well at least -PRON- do not think -PRON- be
-PRON- order the engineer
large
$ 9.69
now yes this be a large sandwich
and -PRON- do take half of -PRON- home
but 10 bone
do not even include the bag of chip or drink
that be $ 2.70 more
so just for -PRON- -PRON- be almost at $ 13.50 out the door
if c be with -PRON- that would have be $ 27 buck for the two of -PRON-
that $ 27 go so much further at so many other place
but -PRON- digress
forget about the price the sandwich be great
the wheat bread be fresh soft and flavorful
the filling which on the engineer include smoke turkey breast melt swiss sauteed mushroom lettuce tomato and mayo be also great
-PRON- do switch out the mayo for mustard though and -PRON- wish there be more mushroom on -PRON- but all in all a good wich
the chip come in a bag so what be there to say about that
the drink well now that come from the most amazing thing since the bread slice machine
the coke freestyle machine
-PRON- first purchase when -PRON- win the lottery
check out the super secret menu hack on youtube for this machine and -PRON- soda drinking day will never be the same
the restaurant be pretty clean
the food be good
the price be a bit high
the flow of ordering be backwards
3.5 star
-PRON- do not love all -PRON- drink but the new pumpkin spice latte be the good -PRON- have ever have
add some wonderful people and nice outdoor seating and -PRON- have a great place
be für ein glück dass es google gibt sonst hätte ich diese bäckerei bestimmt nicht so einfach gefunden
ich war für eine woche in stuttgart und habe dort das
catering auf einem messestand organisiert
meine kundin wollte den besten pflaumenkuchen stuttgarts zum nachmittag anbieten
dank google habe ich die bäckerei frank gefunden die nur wenige schritte von meinem hotel entfernt lag
schon der email kontakt war freundlich und ich habe sehr kompetente antworten und eine perfekte beratung bekomman
nicht nur dass das ladengeschäft einladend ist verführerisch duftet und die auslage einfach hervorragend aussieht aber wir
hatten wirklich den besten kuchen
jeden morgen haben wir frisch gebackene
kuchen und herzhafte teilchen abgeholt die mitarbeiter -PRON- be geschäft hatten alle perfekt vorbereitet und waren ausgesprochen aufmerksam und freundlich es hat einfach spass gemacht

write this review for student look for a place to study
-PRON- be a small starbucks but really good size table and outlet -PRON- think -PRON- hit jack pot when -PRON- find this hide starbucks since -PRON- be so empty compare to the one on 83rd and bell
however -PRON- realize the reason why
-PRON- crank the ac to -30 degree
-PRON- be the type to like -PRON- place cold too but
how -PRON- do -PRON- be literally painful
and -PRON- come dressed prepare to be in the cold
while study here -PRON- have see people go outside to wait for -PRON- drink because -PRON- be so cold inside
-PRON- do take a while to make drink and -PRON- get a hit or miss with the barista -PRON- have meet one that know -PRON- name and drink after one visit and other that be absolutely awful
parking be very limited
-PRON- have have to park on the other end of the lot but the drive through always seem empty and quick
check this place out because of buzzfeed
-PRON- think -PRON- be a great price
love the food and bottomless champagne
-PRON- try the sushi and be pleasantly surprised
the orange chicken and roast beef be -PRON- favorite
-PRON- wish -PRON- have mac n cheese but other than that -PRON- be great
definitely come back here again and would recommend
-PRON- like the buffet style concept as -PRON- fun to pick and choose what -PRON- like
the decor be basic but spacious and there be always plenty of room to sit
most of the food look good and sound interesting but unfortunately the taste do not match up
ive find most of the dressings\/sauce the food be in very vinegary and lack any kind of flavour
often -PRON- be quite dry and stodgy
if -PRON- want basic veggie food at a reasonable price then -PRON- a good place to go but there be definitely other option nearby where -PRON- can get something a lot more flavourful and tasty
come here and take -PRON- brother 's family out for lunch plus bowling here
-PRON- total bill here for bowl with 8 people plus lunch be $ 144.00
-PRON- charge $ 3.50 for the bowling shoe so that be a big ouch
all in all a good experience but $ 144.00 for an hour worth
-PRON- think not
this denny 's have improve since madison be now smoke free
before the smoking ban this place be like eat in an ashtray
now -PRON- be a good place to get what -PRON- would expect from denny 's
-PRON- get to update this review
-PRON- love this place -PRON- really do
-PRON- food be great
service be passable but -PRON- be a little tight with soda refill
but -PRON- be constantly change -PRON- hour
-PRON- use to be open for lunch on the weekend
now -PRON- be not
-PRON- close on weird day
-PRON- have walk up think -PRON- would be open adn
-PRON- be not
-PRON- run the place like -PRON- be a hobby or an intrusion rather than try to run -PRON- like a proper restaurant
-PRON- get annoying
with a new greek place opening soon in westport there be a good chance -PRON- may not go back to atlantis
-PRON- fine
the soap -PRON- give -PRON- be weird
buy a voucher on amazon local to give -PRON- a go
decor be not the fine bathroom floor be dirty but service be excellent and accomodating and sushi be quite good
-PRON- look forward to come back with friend
tall people beware
-PRON- purchase the sunday drive for -PRON- fiance s birthday last week
-PRON- make the point of call the north carolina office to make sure that the program could accommodate -PRON- 6'6 large frame
the office assure -PRON- that -PRON- have car that fit almost anybody and that as long as -PRON- be not tall than 6 foot six and big than 4x -PRON- would be fine
the day of -PRON- birthday -PRON- present -PRON- nascar craze man with the information and -PRON- be thrilled
right away -PRON- ask -PRON- about -PRON- size and -PRON- assure -PRON- -PRON- be fine
after all -PRON- only wear a 2x
-PRON- arrive at the track and again -PRON- ask the manager again assure -PRON- -PRON- would fit no problem
drive time come and -PRON- put on -PRON- fire suit which be far too big for -PRON-
when -PRON- come time -PRON- get through the window no problem but the crew have to stuff -PRON- head in to get -PRON- whole body in
-PRON- be literally shove -PRON- head in
after some discussion back and forth -PRON- be surprised to see -PRON- climb back out
-PRON- turn out -PRON- leg be so long -PRON- go far past the pedal and -PRON- hit -PRON- leg on the steering wheel when try to shift
in other word -PRON- be way to tall
-PRON- feel so bad
here be -PRON- man look humiliate get out of the car rip of -PRON- suit look like -PRON- want to die on -PRON- birthday
the manager offer a 10 lap ride along and free picture and video which -PRON- agree to but later realize be a mistake because really who want picture to remind -PRON- what a horrible birthday -PRON- have
-PRON- email the office in north carolina and share some thought
-PRON- never hear back from -PRON-
so -PRON- feel -PRON- should share -PRON- here
first -PRON- really should have some height and weight recommendation
-PRON- get -PRON- do not want to turn away prospective driver but really -PRON- should have some parameter to give people so at least -PRON- have an idea
frankly another driver that day who be six foot four say -PRON- barely fit
-PRON- fiance say there would be absolutely no way that a 3x or 4x would ever fit and -PRON- have no idea why -PRON- would even think -PRON- would be possible
-PRON- to this day have bruise all over -PRON- body from try to squeeze in
-PRON- probably should not be attempt by anyone tall than six foot four or heavy than 225 lb
second -PRON- should consider a mock up of a car cockpit in -PRON- office so that customer have an opportunity to sit in -PRON- before -PRON- get -PRON- hope up and get dissappoint and more importantly before -PRON- get humiliate when -PRON- do not fit
over all the people who get to drive love -PRON-
however -PRON- will go down in -PRON- personal history as the birthday -PRON- both would like to forget
i love this buffet
normally -PRON- do not like buffet because the food be usually bad to mediocre
and -PRON- be a quality over quantity type of person but buffet be not the case
however ws be recommend to -PRON- by -PRON- friend and -PRON- be extremely attract to the presentation of -PRON- food so i decide to try -PRON-
-PRON- eye always eat before -PRON- mouth do
the buffet be pretty cheap consider -PRON- be all -PRON- can eat for only 25 buck for brunch
-PRON- like how everything be portion into small pot and pan
the fry chicken be flavourful but a little oily yet what can i expect -PRON- fry right
the smoked salmon of course be divine because smoke salmon can never go wrong
the kalbi beef be really good
the angry mac and cheese do not taste very angry or spicy to -PRON- though
the dessert be generally good wide selection yet -PRON- be not too sweet
-PRON- like how -PRON- have a selection of gelato and not just cheap vanilla strawberry or chocolate ice cream
however the chocolate dip strawberry look pretty sad
-PRON- look like the person make -PRON- be in a terrible rush to throw -PRON- on the table
-PRON- taste good but the person who make -PRON- obviously do not really give a shit about what -PRON- look like
the small pecan tart and mini apple pastry\/crumble be good
honestly what make -PRON- want to eat here the most be the presentation of -PRON- food and most of -PRON- dessert be cute and pretty to look at
of course the taste be not bad either
next time -PRON- be in vegas -PRON- be come back for dinner

that be about -PRON-
-PRON- feel awkward cramped and small
staff suck too and -PRON- just seem like alot of snobby people in there
no bueno
food be pretty good have a breakfast sandwich with bacon goat cheese over easy egg and avocado
the price be fair but -PRON- would like to try something new since the sandwich do not knock -PRON- sock off

-PRON- explain since -PRON- be no longer able to provide the channel that -PRON- sign up for -PRON- should let -PRON- out of this contract
but -PRON- be tell the contract clearly state that programming may change
so basically if -PRON- sign up with directv -PRON- be agree to give -PRON- money whatev amount -PRON- choose and -PRON- agree to give -PRON- 250 channel of infomercial or whatev channel -PRON- choose

-PRON- have get pizza from here a few time
-PRON- be super simple ordering from -PRON-
-PRON- do actually flip the pizza the not roll through a machine like the chain one do
-PRON- do not know why but -PRON- like -PRON- pizza flip not just squish
that be -PRON-
the pizza price be very reasonable and the one -PRON- have order hate tasty
-PRON- wife do order some boneless chicken wing once
this be what kind of kill -PRON- for -PRON-
-PRON- look like nugget or something similar
frozen nugget
-PRON- give -PRON- container with the sauce in -PRON- not on the chicken
that be a huge blow for -PRON-
-PRON- will not order -PRON- chicken wing ago
-PRON- will stick to -PRON- regular place for wing
with that say -PRON- still order -PRON- pizza
there have not be a bad pizza
the staff there be friendly from the time -PRON- call on to order and the time -PRON- get there and pay and leave
will keep order -PRON- pizza unless -PRON- find something good
if -PRON- could give the liberty 4.5 star -PRON- would
this be a great concept with excellent follow through
the gastropub concept be an interesting one upscale pub food with extensive beer offering
the liberty deliver on both
even though -PRON- be a casual restaurant and pub -PRON- can make reservation
-PRON- do and -PRON- friend
and -PRON- sit in the dining room portion of the joint
good choice for have conversation
the menu be simple and do not have too many option
-PRON- order the lucky gastro pig just to say the name really
but -PRON- be so glad -PRON- do
-PRON- be slow roasted black berkshire pork shoulder with crepes pickled pineapple spicy peanuts jalapenos lettuce cups
no joke that be what -PRON- get
the pork be in a little le creuset pot
-PRON- do need a little salt and pepper but maybe that be -PRON- taste
-PRON- be delicious and -PRON- eat every bite
-PRON- friend order the burger and fry and the wing
the fry have parmesan on -PRON- and be amazing
-PRON- be both very pleased with -PRON- entree
-PRON- server be great
josh ask for -PRON-
-PRON- be even funny and responsive when -PRON- friend point out the misspelled menu item which be write all over the wall example chedder for cheddar etc
-PRON- only beef with this place be a couple of thing with the decor
the dull poster with a photo shop picture of beer and a cute poem need to go see the photo
-PRON- should bring in local art
-PRON- would look great on the wall make of reclaim wood
and -PRON- need to take down the cheesy and misspell menu item graphic from the wall
-PRON- make -PRON- look like a disney pub where -PRON- have to explain who -PRON- be the customer right away
this place can keg stand on -PRON- be own without gimmick
the bar be packed when -PRON- leave at 11 pm on a friday quite the scene
-PRON- will be back when -PRON- visit charlotte
-PRON- have wait to write a review about town tavern because -PRON- like to go a few time to a bar before -PRON- give a public opinion
after 3 night spread out over a few week of course -PRON- think -PRON- have a good feel
pros cheap drink especially on fridays
-PRON- be very hard to go wrong with $ 1 domestic draft
usually pretty busy start around 11 on a weekend night
dj play good music for a drinking party type atmosphere
never pay a cover
have both an upstairs and downstairs both with a bit of a different feel
con
since the place be on the small side there be only one man 's and one woman 's bathroom upstairs
on friday $ 1 beer night -PRON- can expect a long wait to the bar after 10 pm
tends to be a more frat party environment which could be good if that be -PRON- taste
hard to hear other people in -PRON- group on a weekend night
hope the pro 's and con 's style simplifie the review try to cover the most important component drink deal bathroom atmosphere and music
love -PRON- food
-PRON- order a pie or two for all -PRON- special occasions\/holidays\/celebration
if -PRON- always want something to be wrong with -PRON- order order from this location
-PRON- love the pizza and garlic sauce so -PRON- keep come back and every time there be a mistake
sometimes -PRON- be a small mistake like forget the extra garlic sauce that -PRON- pay extra for sometimes -PRON- be a large mistake like give -PRON- pizza to someone else so when -PRON- arrive -PRON- food be not there
everytime -PRON- be reluctant to admit wrong doing or fix -PRON-
-PRON- really try to like this place be from illinois i grow up eat italian beef 's and chicago hot dog
-PRON- have even try al 's in chi town and enjoy the service and the food
-PRON- think with something -PRON- just do not transplant well in other city
to be fair -PRON- be not the food that have -PRON- feel like this the first time -PRON- come -PRON- have a groupon and -PRON- place be pretty much empty
i think -PRON- be due to be in between lunch and dinner
one guy be work -PRON- be very friendly
and -PRON- be the one who take -PRON- order and make -PRON- food
everything be great the sandwich to meat ratio be perfect as the amount of cheese on the italian beef and the italian beef with sausage combo
-PRON- be so happy to find an authentic chi town restaurant and know -PRON- would be back
visit 2 the restaurant be super busy and -PRON- order the same thing -PRON- have last time the regular italian beef and the italian beef and sausage combo and add a chi dog to see what -PRON- be work with
the highlight of the meal with the chi dog
both sandwich have way too much cheese on -PRON-
-PRON- be crazy
-PRON- be more like a cheese sandwich with a side of meat
because -PRON- do not want to have to wait to eat -PRON- food know -PRON- would be a wait because of the amount of people that day
and -PRON- have other thing to do
-PRON- scrap off some of the cheese and eat -PRON-
3rd and final visit
so -PRON- order -PRON- regular italian beef sandwich
i ask light on the cheese load fry this time and -PRON- husband order the maxwell street polish and a chi dog
-PRON- walk up to get -PRON- food when -PRON- be do
and -PRON- ask the lady who call -PRON- over where the polish be
-PRON- say awl
i think -PRON- do not want -PRON-
-PRON- be confuse at this point because -PRON- never say -PRON- do not want -PRON-
i order -PRON- sandwich
-PRON- husband say let -PRON- get the chi dog and the polish now where -PRON- get -PRON- do not want -PRON- out that sentence confuse -PRON-
so -PRON- be just stand in front of -PRON- look puzzle

-PRON- be
sorry do -PRON- want -PRON- to make -PRON- one nothing
-PRON- tell -PRON- husband what happen -PRON- be like just go order the polish
now if any of -PRON- know about an italian beef but -PRON- have to eat -PRON- when -PRON- get -PRON- because if not -PRON- get soggy
so -PRON- ask -PRON- can -PRON- just ring one up for -PRON-
-PRON- look at -PRON- and say -PRON- get to go down there and order -PRON-
now at this point i be annoyed because there be 3 people in line -PRON- mess up -PRON- order not active listening and now i have to go to the end of the line to order something that -PRON- should of have in the first place -PRON- go and get in line then -PRON- husband be like never mind by the time -PRON- order -PRON- will be mush
on top of all this -PRON- know -PRON- would not be back when -PRON- go to refill -PRON- drink
and -PRON- see one of the girl that be make the food eat fry now i know that be not sanitary at all
when -PRON- see -PRON- -PRON- walk over and get a paper towel and wipe off -PRON- glove like that make a difference
oh and -PRON- food be still way to cheesy even when -PRON- ask for light on the cheese

when ever -PRON- need bread for a meal unless -PRON- be pull an all nighter
on weekend the place be pack with people of all age grab a snack or coffee
have stick to the food only so -PRON- can not comment on the drink
when this place first open -PRON- do not like the bread and stay away
in a pinch -PRON- grab a couple bun and be pleasantly surprised with the freshness
one of -PRON- favourite be the giant hamburger bun
be -PRON- a hamburger bun
maybe not but that be what i put in -PRON-
odd note all the stuff that look like -PRON- will taste like a conventional croissant do not taste like a croissant
tastes less buttery and more dense
try a cheese and ham puff pastry half price day old special thing that look croissant y
-PRON- be not croissant y but be very good even the day after
price be good but not great but hey they are open late
-PRON- be like have a double rainbow in a bakery

-PRON- friend insist -PRON- stop by for breakfast
-PRON- have get to say that -PRON- be so glad -PRON- would not let -PRON- leave vegas until -PRON- do
never in a million year would -PRON- compliment bad decorate but -PRON- get to say what a groovy place
the atmosphere definitely make -PRON- feel like -PRON- just step back into the 1970 's or early 80 's
down chicka down down
the wait be about 30 minute but -PRON- be worth -PRON-
the table be booth that feel like private cove
-PRON- waitress be really sweet attentive and on top of everything
-PRON- be amazed how -PRON- remember all -PRON- table with these tuck away cove like booth
with all the mirror and light -PRON- be definitely not a place where -PRON- can drink on the job
-PRON- order a salad and -PRON- be huge
-PRON- husband have the egg white omelette and say -PRON- be great
the coffee be fresh -PRON- appreciate the large mug btw
the price be a bit high for the diner atmosphere but that would not stop -PRON- from come back
because let -PRON- face
it-- -PRON- have waste -PRON- cash on bad experience in this town
go here once and -PRON- be nice
-PRON- have never be to a soup kitchen but this one remind -PRON- of what -PRON- think one would look like
from what -PRON- can tell -PRON- have a large array of soup
-PRON- have the corn chowd and -PRON- be yumm
get -PRON- in -PRON- special with a wrap the lamb one and -PRON- be delicious
a little on the expensive side for lunch though $ 13 after tax
-PRON- be usually a bit wary of salty soup but the chowder be not salty at all
but the tiny patio on the back be pretty cool with neat orange sun mural
definitely one of the cooler place in toronto
-PRON- get halal guys around this time where -PRON- have -PRON- soft opening
the location be great because -PRON- be near both ryerson uoft and eaton centre
-PRON- have a regular platter with both chicken and gyro over rice with lettuce and salsa
the platter be serve with rice pita lettuce and tomato
-PRON- can also get the platter with -PRON- famous hot or white sauce and the choice of topping
the pita be super good to balance out with -PRON- hot sauce because -PRON- definitely be spicy for -PRON- but not overly spicy where -PRON- can not enjoy the dish
-PRON- famous white and hot sauce be also delicious no wonder -PRON- do not reveal the recipe
service be quick -PRON- will be return
note
halal guys taste best right when -PRON- be serve but even after a couple hour when -PRON- heat -PRON- up -PRON- still taste good
-PRON- call 1 hour ahead on a friday night
get a reservation for 6 on the patio
beautiful night in phoenix
overall everything be excellent
no problem split the check
the server be anxious for -PRON- group to order
-PRON- order beer wine appetizer
there be a long gap between serve -PRON- entree but -PRON- do not mind as -PRON- all share taste
a diverse group
sushi lover and non sushi lover

-PRON- say -PRON- be just okay
the roll be amazing
-PRON- order several different kind and enjoy -PRON- all
soup be good too
service be matter of fact
not obsequious but pretty good
recommend for affordable casual night out
go here 2 week ago
as gangnam asian bbq have an hour wait at 9 p.m. on a sunday
base on other review look like -PRON- get overflow from gangnam often
food be mediocre although plentiful
service be friendly but -PRON- have different wait staff come by
-PRON- check on -PRON- verbally but -PRON- do not seem to notice that -PRON- drink get low
overall very average -PRON- do not intend to come back
each year -PRON- go to nuit blache
-PRON- think -PRON- will like -PRON-
-PRON- love art and love the idea of devote a night where -PRON- public space celebrate -PRON-
that say every year -PRON- be vastly disappoint
there be huge drunken crowd meander to
-PRON- have no idea where
the installment be few and far between and be disappointing
-PRON- really want to like nuit blache
-PRON- think the concept be amazing
-PRON- just can not seem to find any execution of -PRON- that -PRON- do not hate
where be the nuit blanche that people like
be -PRON- on some hidden magical street somewhere
-PRON- guess -PRON- will keep search
despite -PRON- -PRON- will try again next year and do even more research before hand
-PRON- staple here be the veal sandwich
start off at $ 6 for just the veal bread
extra topping cost $ 1 1.50 per item
well worth -PRON- in -PRON- opinion as the topping be quite generous see picture below
finish one can be challenging
service here be always friendly
such a great course all of the green look great
the staff inside the pro shop and at the restaurant be all super nice
-PRON- be hit and miss
-PRON- have coleslaw and pico which be different from the other place -PRON- usually frequent but -PRON- burrito be generally small than the competition and be more expensive
-PRON- be happen a couple of time where -PRON- have hand -PRON- someone else be burrito which suck because -PRON- get takeout and never realize -PRON- be not what -PRON- order til -PRON- get home
this review be for michael ray
-PRON- be very helpful and always answer or return -PRON- call when -PRON- try to get in contact with -PRON-
the only reason for 4 star be because -PRON- do not get the house rent out when -PRON- want to
not to say that be -PRON- fault necessarily
but that be what the situation be
-PRON- would go with renter 's warehouse again and especially with michael
bang bang be a bit out of the way for -PRON-
-PRON- be not usually in this area
but since -PRON- love anything earl grey flavor -PRON- know -PRON- have to come and try the earl grey ice cream
there be a line up on a rainy day in the summer
because -PRON- be so busy -PRON- can not offer too many sample since this slow down the line
the shop be small

the food be incredible but -PRON- be give the same wrong order twice -PRON- take 30 + minute after place -PRON- order to get -PRON- food and the two party next to -PRON- be give wrong order multiple time as well
there be a ton of food cook and ready to be serve but despite several 6 8 food runner and manager -PRON- just could not get -PRON- together
hence four vs. five star
that be say -PRON- would get five star if -PRON- get -PRON- act together in the service front
the waffle be crispy and buttery taste without be too greasy and the flavor combination be creative and delicious
-PRON- order the sausage and egg waffle the pesto and egg waffle and the lemon berry waffle side note
the pesto be what elevate the already good flavor of that waffle sandwich and the lemon berry waffle need more berry
all be incredible and -PRON- would go back here in a heartbeat if -PRON- come back to vegas
-PRON- be always busy here for good reason but do not let the long line scare -PRON- because -PRON- actually move pretty quick
the food here be amazing as always but the efficient staff make -PRON- 5 star
the chicken be amazing in any form

ugh

oh and any of the side rock
solid go to place
salads rule too
the dx be a small but interesting gallery space in the td bank tower right in the financial district
-PRON- be not where -PRON- normally expect to go to look at art sort of a hidden gem in the middle of all the bank and business
and unlike most thing in the financial district -PRON- be open on weekend
also -PRON- have be there a number of time and -PRON- be never crowd
actually on several occasion -PRON- have have the gallery to -PRON-
kind of nice
-PRON- be house in the old toronto stock exchange but the trading floor be not open to the public
-PRON- be use for private event mostly
-PRON- be there for an exhibition open party and the hall be very art deco clean and elegant
the main gallery be on the 3rd floor

check the website for detail http:\/\/www.dx.org\/.
service be excellent
extremely friendly on -PRON- first visit
hawaiian chipotle
love -PRON-
quality of food be unmatched will definitely return
food be well make but not exceptional gourmet so -PRON- can not see the high price justification especially when the portion be small
-PRON- also find a lot of discrepancy in -PRON- menu price so be aware of the charge
-PRON- happen upon this place because -PRON- be in the area and -PRON- find -PRON- to the most review on yelp
walk in -PRON- feel like -PRON- be very similar to the type of thing -PRON- would see in the states i.e. paradise bakery or panera -PRON- be not super clear how to order and -PRON- take a minute to figure out how -PRON- work but in all -PRON- be very similar to other place about town offer soup and sandwich
the pastry look amazing and -PRON- be a lovely space all be -PRON- a bit too massive
the window be great but -PRON- feel a bit like a cafeteria maybe
the staff be very friendly and -PRON- food come out promptly
-PRON- be surprised -PRON- do not give -PRON- table number see -PRON- be such a large café but -PRON- have no trouble find -PRON-
the food be very good however a bit pricy -PRON- be very large portion for lunch size
for £ 8.95 -PRON- can do a half sandwich and soup or a quiche and soup
-PRON- opt for one of each -PRON- get the brie and aubergine quiche and the roasted pepper and cabbage soup and -PRON- boyfriend have the salmon sandwich and a chicken and lentil soup
the quiche be delicious lot of brie and a great sized slice
the soup be equally as lovely -PRON- only gripe be that parsley be not a great garnish but that be just -PRON-
the half sandwich be definitely a whole sandwich in -PRON- opinion and the bread be amazingly soft and grain fill
-PRON- really enjoy splash out for lunch but -PRON- recommendation would be to lower the price and the portion size
-PRON- be not somewhere -PRON- would go regularly for lunch as without drink -PRON- meal be £ 18 together
-PRON- have find the same sort of meal to be about £ 12 13 pound elsewhere
although great quality so -PRON- can not complain other then be a sort of budget eater
-PRON- also have a mixed lunch crowd include business to baby
so be warn
if -PRON- go downstairs to use the loo -PRON- can see into the bakery and -PRON- just smell wonderfully of butter
-PRON- would say a lovely place to grab a bit but -PRON- do not feel very local if that make sense
maybe the size of -PRON- make -PRON- feel -PRON- be not a very warm place to have lunch regularly
although the £ 1 filter coffee remind -PRON- of america and good on -PRON- for offer -PRON-
definitely a very business area type eatery with delicious food although slightly out of -PRON- price range to be a regular
although the sweet and treat look heavenly
maybe -PRON- will return for a delicious treat some day
this place be amazing perfect service even good food
-PRON- would recommend the lotus chip carnita taco when pig fly 20 vegetable fry rice
thsis be a great place to grab some pint after a work training uptown
bartender be friendly and the place be very casual
-PRON- be hide away nicely in an alley
a good escape from corporate america in uptown
good price decent food
-PRON- should be note on the menu that there be meat in the pizza muffin but -PRON- be not
as a vegetarian this would have be vital information to know
-PRON- calzone be alright nothing special but -PRON- may return for a pizza
will update when -PRON- return
-PRON- have never have an arepa before
and now -PRON- be a big fan -PRON- especially like the cilantro sauce serve with -PRON-
the vegan arepa with the plantain and avocado be worth go to find this truck
price be good the people be nice and -PRON- be happy -PRON- have such a lovely vegan option
this be a queen west staple
-PRON- be the go to pho place for -PRON-
and -PRON- have be live in the area for 10 year
if -PRON- be look for a decent pho restaurant -PRON- will not be disappoint
bad food -PRON- have ever have
but wait -PRON- do not actually eat -PRON- dinner because -PRON- have no flavor
not to mention no salt pepper cheese or pepper flake even a pizza shop have that on -PRON- table
and when -PRON- tell the owner -PRON- be not good -PRON- shrug -PRON- shoulder and walk away
horrible service
-PRON- would not waste -PRON- time or money
cleveland have a lot of really good italian restaurant this just be not one if -PRON-
-PRON- love -PRON- fish taco
-PRON- just finish a great meal at a reasonable price
the service by sheena be on point
-PRON- will be back
this review do have a happy ending really
last monday -PRON- decide -PRON- need new tire for -PRON- car
after a little online shopping -PRON- decide on discount tire and give -PRON- a call
since -PRON- be head out of town tuesday and wednesday -PRON- make an appointment for thursday at 8:00 am
-PRON- arrive about 40 minute late but have call ahead to let -PRON- know and when -PRON- check -PRON- in
-PRON- say -PRON- be not a problem
after ask for the car to be do by noon and be assure -PRON- would be ready -PRON- be on -PRON- way back to the office
12:30 pm come and -PRON- give the store a call to confirm the car be ready and be tell -PRON- be all set
-PRON- have one of -PRON- friend come and give -PRON- a ride to discount tire
-PRON- usually do not check the work but today something strike -PRON- to take a look at the car before -PRON- go inside
low and behold the car have not move since -PRON- drop -PRON- off in the morning
-PRON- go inside and stand in line and when -PRON- be finally wait on -PRON- bring the situation to -PRON- attention
unfortunately -PRON- need -PRON- car for afternoon appointment and could not wait any longer even though -PRON- offer to get -PRON- in right away and get -PRON- do in 15 minute
-PRON- leave the store extremely upset as -PRON- have plan on leave on vacation the next day and be out of time to get the tire
when -PRON- get back to the office -PRON- decide to give -PRON- a call and wound up speak to an assistant mgr
ultimately -PRON- offer to pick up -PRON- car and bring -PRON- back to -PRON- which be the good solution -PRON- could have offer
-PRON- really appreciate -PRON-
before this experience -PRON- would have give discount tire 4 or 5 star and in the end -PRON- make -PRON- right
-PRON- just wish -PRON- would have do the work when -PRON- be suppose to
-PRON- consultation with mr. heyman be very informative as -PRON- go over many option and give -PRON- a few idea on how to handle -PRON- situation that -PRON- do not think of before -PRON- go in to meet -PRON-
-PRON- enjoy talk to -PRON- and appreciate -PRON- help so much
-PRON- will be weigh out the option on -PRON- possible marriage for a couple more month
or so
but if -PRON- do pull the trigger on -PRON- -PRON- know who -PRON- want to handle -PRON- case
la cruda be locate just south of thomas and 32nd street in a small strip mall
the restaurant be small clean with a trendy old diner feel
great customer service very patient with -PRON- for -PRON- first visit
restaurant have michelada drink plus food menu
the fresh shrimp with clamato be so good reminder bring -PRON- own beer
also order the plate with fresh shrimp oyster dry shrimp beef jerky cucumber with all the spice delicious
very fresh produce
-PRON- love this place
-PRON- will return
however -PRON- be make a plea to the owner to fire the rude barmaid that greet -PRON- wife and -PRON- when -PRON- go in last friday april 8
hopefully after some detective work -PRON- will know who -PRON- be talk about there be two girl work along with -PRON- bearded friend
this one be a brunette
story
-PRON- arrive later in the evening on a friday so -PRON- know -PRON- would be tough get a table or a spot at the bar
-PRON- do eventually find two seat at the bar and sit down
after roughly 5 10 minute many pass from this girl with not even a simple greeting or a shred of eye contact give to -PRON-
unusual
eventually -PRON- call to the barmaid and attempt to order a beer
-PRON- be rudely instruct that -PRON- be at capacity and that -PRON- could no longer serve new customer
okay this be what -PRON- be deal with
fine by -PRON-
generally restaurant and bar will have doorman to keep thing in check but -PRON- like the fact -PRON- can still enter a place particularly in the cold month and wait
after the beer rejection -PRON- proceed to ask if -PRON- could have a glass of water while -PRON- wait
again a rude and curt no response
-PRON- response -PRON- can not have a glass of water
okay -PRON- will wait
after roughly 20 minute or so and after 2 3 party have leave roughly 8 9 people -PRON- ask if -PRON- could be serve
again rude response -PRON- be not go to be happen tonight
state without eye contact
what the hell
if -PRON- be not go to happen please tell -PRON- so -PRON- can go somewhere else to eat instead of allow -PRON- to sit at the bar hungry and thirsty for 20 minute
-PRON- be an easygoing guy and -PRON- have be to this place many many time and have always have a positive experience
the mussel be great the beer be top notch and -PRON- have have many friendly conversation with the staff
as a result -PRON- have refer ton of people to this bar
smokeless joes fire this bitch immediately
-PRON- be a cancer at -PRON- fine establishment
everyone be entitle to a bad day or night but this be not the case
pure bitchiness rudeness and an elitist attitude ooze off of this girl
and to the girl if -PRON- happen to read this review please heed these word readfbetweuenthceklyinoesu
cheers smokeless joe 's -PRON- be still beloved
please know that though -PRON- sell for a living -PRON- never hard sell so these be just the fact as -PRON- know -PRON-
please also know that -PRON- be write this only a week after the repair
and -PRON- have not drive the car much since then fly out of town for a few day
so -PRON- can not speak to the longevity of the repair
-PRON- can speak to -PRON- three year warranty though -PRON- show -PRON- that -PRON- be willing to guarantee -PRON- work for a reasonable amount of time more than most
-PRON- have apparently be at the same location for over 40 year and with that warranty -PRON- obviously plan on stay there
and that -PRON- be not one of those sleazy fly by night place that screw everybody then change location and change -PRON- name
-PRON- need an oil change and some cool system work on -PRON- 2004 mazda rx8
kyle essert
-PRON- do not know what -PRON- job title be
facilitator coordinator have one of the mechanic check -PRON- over not only the cool system but the whole car
usually the latter be a means for sleazy company to scare -PRON- into get more repair but in this case -PRON- really do not get the feeling that that be the case
kyle tell -PRON- what be wrong -PRON- could get -PRON- fix with 3a or someone else or not -PRON- decision
the price be not cheap but -PRON- be not way high or anything
so -PRON- ask -PRON- to proceed with the cool system repair
-PRON- say that the brake be close to be bad but since -PRON- be think of sell the car -PRON- choose to wait
-PRON- be fine with that and do not attempt to hard sell -PRON-
in the meantime -PRON- do an online search to get a value for the car
-PRON- should have do -PRON- sooner
but -PRON- remember that the last time -PRON- do one the car be though pretty old still worth quite a bit something like $ 16,000
after this research though -PRON- find that the price have drop dramatically down to $ 6000
the car only have 48,500 mile on -PRON-
so -PRON- reason that -PRON- would be good if -PRON- keep the car
-PRON- still love -PRON- and in theory -PRON- should give -PRON- quite a few more mile
so -PRON- call kyle and ask -PRON- to have the brake do too
a little later -PRON- remember that -PRON- low beam be dead problem with this car that -PRON- think would be expensive to repair the high beam and driving light still work and since -PRON- rarely drive after dark -PRON- have put -PRON- off
so -PRON- call kyle again and ask -PRON- to look into -PRON-
later -PRON- call and say -PRON- have have new bulb put in the car but that the ballast be dead and that the whole assembly be $ 2200 each from mazda
-PRON- have do more online research and find after market alternative but -PRON- warn -PRON- that -PRON- would still need about $ 450 to install -PRON- because -PRON- have to remove the front bumper etc to get too -PRON-
-PRON- promptly tell -PRON- to forget -PRON- -PRON- say -PRON- would have the new bulb remove and return -PRON- to the supply house
-PRON- pick -PRON- up the next day with the headlight thing -PRON- take longer than anticipate not -PRON- fault and be very pleased with the bill
price be exactly what kyle have quote and -PRON- have only charge -PRON- $ 39 for all that hassle\/research of the headlight issue
more than fair -PRON- think
so that be -PRON-
cool system and brake work great now
fine shop and an excellent experience
-PRON- apologize for the length of this
but -PRON- like to write useful review rather than twitter length crap
the server be terrible
just now -PRON- go there buy a handbag for the birthday gift to -PRON- mom
-PRON- know what -PRON- want and go straight to point one of those bag
-PRON- said:"i want this one for -PRON- mom
the server said:"oh that be good for -PRON- mom"i can not see any smile on -PRON- face and -PRON- do not even greet -PRON- the whole time
when -PRON- walk to cashier try to pay -PRON- say -PRON- do not have a new this be the last one
-PRON- do not say sorry do not say something like -PRON- can check that first if -PRON- want -PRON- or tell -PRON- more information about the after sale

find out about -PRON- when -PRON- be leave panera
kinda bum that -PRON- do not have a huge selection at about 3:39 in the afternoon
but -PRON- understand that -PRON- be close on the next 2 hour
as far as the cupcake super expensive
-PRON- be from alabama and could get half a box of cupcake for $ 3.50
-PRON- be good but the price make -PRON- a little hesitant
-PRON- do have a loyalty card so -PRON- be something to look forward too if -PRON- stomach can handle the sugar coma that be the cupcakery
when -PRON- say -PRON- cupcake be sweet -PRON- mean -PRON- eat freakin sweet
-PRON- vary depend on which one -PRON- get but -PRON- be still good
the plop of frosting be just intimidating
-PRON- would recommend this place though
not as a regular up law joint but as a guilty pleasure every now and then
-PRON- order a plain chicken sandwich in drive thru and be tell to pull forward
-PRON- get to the window and the young girl in the window say uhhh what do -PRON- mean by plain grill chicken sandwich
-PRON- should have know right at that moment to just drive away
-PRON- should have continue on to -PRON- appointment hungry and merely annoy at the stupidity
instead -PRON- explain with hand gesture
grill chicken between two slice of bread
how can this be complicate
but -PRON- get bad
the poor girl have no idea how to ring this in
-PRON- call over another young lady who also could not figure out such a strange request
then a young man come over
finally after another 5 minute the manager come over and press some button
with triumph in -PRON- eye the first girl proudly tell -PRON- a total of close to $ 8
huh
-PRON- add a drink at the ridiculous price of around $ 2.50 ok get that
where be the rest come from
oh
-PRON- be charge for a chicken club even though -PRON- be not get bacon on -PRON-
yay -PRON-
fine -PRON- say
-PRON- pay more annoyed at -PRON- than how -PRON- be overcharge and -PRON- take four people to figure out the register and -PRON- drive away
but -PRON- get bad
-PRON- pull out -PRON- grill chicken between to grease cover slice of what can only be -PRON- sourdough bread and the chicken be black
not only be -PRON- an unnatural color for any cooked chicken -PRON- be small
small than any fast food chicken -PRON- have ever see
-PRON- risk a bite
-PRON- should have probably know just by the look shoe leather
-PRON- could not have be any dry have -PRON- be the actual desert -PRON- live in
at this point -PRON- would say that -PRON- get bad but -PRON- stay about the same
-PRON- do not eat the shoe leather -PRON- overcharge -PRON- for and do not have an opportunity to return -PRON- or call the store until the next morning
when -PRON- call to speak to a manager -PRON- be tell there be none until 8 am
from personal experience in fast food -PRON- do not know when -PRON- be ever allow to not have a person in charge on any shift
-PRON- call another nearby location
-PRON- want to know if -PRON- complaint would be even close to valid
to verify there be always suppose to be management at jitb a club mean with bacon and hold time do exist on food -PRON- serve as well as after 4 p.m. all grill chicken be suppose to be cook to order
the wonderful lady that -PRON- speak with at the other location be full of useful information and even offer to buy -PRON- breakfast to make up for the location on 59th ave
-PRON- decline
-PRON- think -PRON- be do with jitb for awhile
-PRON- have not have great experience there lately
but this happen to be absolutely crazy bad
and -PRON- need to share
-PRON- do do the survey that be on -PRON- receipt and -PRON- be contact by -PRON- district manager
-PRON- give credit to the lady on thunderbird and -PRON- be friendly on 59th ave but -PRON- be so do
-PRON- offer -PRON- money back and coupon to go back to any jitb in the valley
like

while -PRON- want to do more city stuff -PRON- convince -PRON- that maybe do some outdoor stuff will give -PRON- a good change of scenery from all the casino
-PRON- do not really know what to expect but -PRON- think perhaps -PRON- would be with a large group and -PRON- would have to take break while -PRON- wait for people to learn
luckily for -PRON- this be not the case
safak show up in the van on time even though there be traffic

the actual riding be pretty awesome
make sure -PRON- wear pant or the exhaust will bbq -PRON- leg

when -PRON- start rid -PRON- go from easy task to more complex one such as drive on two wheel and donut

so -PRON- be not like -PRON- have to take -PRON- easy the whole time
-PRON- be the only two rider that day
so -PRON- ride for around an hour and a half or more
-PRON- be long but a lot of fun
safak be very knowledgeable about the area 's history and also about the riding

the whole experience be a blast and -PRON- be a nice break from the city

perfect for an afternoon snack before dinner
even good be that -PRON- be a two minute walk from -PRON- hotel
delicious
friendly helpful staff crazy milkshake combo and gourmet burger
-PRON- get the perfect 10 gouda cheese carmelized onion on a pretzel bun

-PRON- sauce dressing be homemade
re have an industrial\/moderm style -PRON- staff be very friendly
for all this reason -PRON- just simply love this place
previous reviewer have do an awesome job of describe the castle so instead -PRON- will give -PRON- a little yelpy anecdote
way back in the mist of time when -PRON- be young scottish teenager
-PRON- use to walk along princess street stop some local person then in -PRON- very good fake american accent ask -PRON- excuse -PRON- mam
please can -PRON- tell -PRON- where -PRON- edin boroh cast al be

f*ck off -PRON- dumb yank
quality by the way
wow
-PRON- be pleased with everything
chessa be -PRON- server and -PRON- be prompt friendly and funny
give great recommendation to -PRON-
-PRON- say the hollandaise be excellent
-PRON- order -PRON- and -PRON- be right
-PRON- provence benedict be awesome
hubby get the meat lover 's skillet and love -PRON-
chessa say the make the good pancake so -PRON- hubby have -PRON- instead of toast
-PRON- be amazing
light fluffy and easy to overeat
-PRON- will be -PRON- breakfast joint from now on
if -PRON- be look for the seafood boil concept this be the place for -PRON-
if -PRON- be look for good service and good food -PRON- would suggest go elsewhere
the crab leg be just ok nothing to get excited about
-PRON- have -PRON- most popular seasoning but find -PRON- bland
-PRON- would have just prefer garlic butter -PRON- think
-PRON- waitress be annoying and slow
overall not a great experience
não há cafeteria melhor no mundo do que um tim hortons
meu vício literalmente
um sabor incrível uma delicia
preço
mega barato
recomendo pedir o maple cinnamon com recheio
de cream cheese e de bebida
o tradicional french vanilla lugar maravilhoso super indico
the food be delicious and -PRON- chilli verde be awesome
while the food be worth the wait the wait can be rough if outside
look to walk around for a while unless -PRON- like to be surround by smoke

however there many little shop -PRON- can wander in while -PRON- wait
mgmt should strongly consider move smoking area away from entrance
if the wait be to long -PRON- look for a different place to eat
loved xavier 's show
-PRON- be funny and entertaining
xavier be very nice and welcome everyone to take a photo with -PRON- after the show
-PRON- be pass through the area on -PRON- way back from hoover dam
-PRON- order a combination plate with a chicken enchilada and a chicken taco
the food be indifferent and the service be poor
the only save grace be the chip and salsa
avoid
the riddle room be great however -PRON- have never try the riddle room -PRON-
aside from an escape game type of thing this place be a cafe game lounge and restaurant
-PRON- sell food and an incredible variety of drink that be surprisingly high quality
this place be probably good than 80 of the cafe out there
a major reason why this place be awesome as heck be that there be probably 500 board game to choose from which -PRON- can play for free as well as n64 and stuff
why not have a sandwich and a latte while play mario party with friend all for about the same price -PRON- would pay at starbucks or any other cafe
if -PRON- be in the area give -PRON- a shot
-PRON- will not regret -PRON-
when this first open -PRON- would have give -PRON- 4 or maybe 5 star
however -PRON- feel like the pucketeria an affectionate term coin by -PRON- coworker have go down hill
-PRON- think that the quality of ingredient be still good than average but the execution have become pretty sad
cold fry overdone burger old iced tea late order and a dwindle menu have all contribute to -PRON- disappointment
-PRON- think that skip the detail and shrink -PRON- menu have be in response to public criticism about the expensive price
-PRON- be happy to pay for a good lunch and consider the previous quality of food
-PRON- do not think the price be unreasonable
-PRON- be dismayed at the change at the pucketeria
maybe the springs should cave in to the rj and -PRON- reader and turn -PRON- into a corndog stand\/buffet
this be vegas
sustainable and elegant food
bah
-PRON- want $ 5.99 buffet
at first daily special seem inspire but after -PRON- get past the chichi name -PRON- may discover -PRON- have order nothing but a cold quesadilla with shred pork
in general the experience can be underwhelm for newcomer who may expect more from the wolfgang puck brand
nonetheless old standbys like the various pizza be still tasty and that be why -PRON- give the place three star
the lemon pasta salad side dish remain a favorite
the food be not too greasy and -PRON- will not feel blah after eat lunch
-PRON- coworker and -PRON- go here whenever -PRON- can not figure out what -PRON- want to eat
if -PRON- do not want ginormous portion or if -PRON- want to save money order from the kid 's menu
the kid size portion be reasonably price and be a good size for lunch if -PRON- be ok with cold fry
wir waren -PRON- be excalibur zur australischen bee gee show und meine große vorfreude auf diese musik war schnell erloschen
die musik für den kleinen
saal viel zu laut und das schlimmste war das die herren nicht gut singen konnten
es war ein schlecht konzert
awesome wing
generally great food
love just about any sandwich with half and half much good than typical sport bar fare
the service be usually on point and price be reasonable
the only bummer be that -PRON- can be pretty damn hard to get in on a football sunday
this restaurant remind -PRON- of an abusive relationship
one server be extremely nice and the other almost make -PRON- friend cry
beside that the food be extremely authentic
-PRON- leave with mystery meat stick in -PRON- tooth
first time here today for lunch and kneaders do not disappoint
-PRON- be greet by a friendly cashier who take -PRON- order
-PRON- be tear between the chicken salad croissant sandwich and the turkey bacon avocado on focaccia
-PRON- go with the turkey sandwich and -PRON- be amazing
the bread be delicious and all of the sandwich fixing be fresh
-PRON- would not change a thing about how -PRON- make -PRON-
if -PRON- be super hungry this could be a one person sandwich
but -PRON- be big enough to share
-PRON- be come back to this place and bring the rest of the family next time
-PRON- have hear -PRON- also serve breakfast and can not wait to try -PRON-
decide to give grand noodle another try and be much happy this time
-PRON- order signature pork bone soup with house noodle pork jowl and squid really enjoy this soup base
-PRON- be very flavourful without be overly salty
tom yum soup with thick vermicelli pork liver and quail egg
the soup be a bit too sour for -PRON- liking but delicious nonetheless
the liver be cook perfectly and compliment the soup very well
spicy pork tenderous rib side
this be actually pretty spicy
for a $ 1.95 add on there be actually a lot of meat here
overall -PRON- think -PRON- soup noodle fare better than the rice dish
bowl be big topping be generous and most importantly -PRON- do not feel thirsty after the meal
this be -PRON- second time here so clearly something be work
to be exact -PRON- remember -PRON- mac n cheese and boy be -PRON- happy that -PRON- reunite
-PRON- have be to -PRON- share of high end steak house in chicago and always splurge on mac n cheese and this be by far the good one how can -PRON- go wrong with truffle
-PRON- hubby order the bone in rib eye
and -PRON- get the prime flat iron both well prepared and season
-PRON- do not have a reservation but be seat promptly on a saturday night
and the fry be ahh maz
do not receive a full 5 star because of service
-PRON- server be not very engaging nor enthusiastic
-PRON- could have be more pleasant
seriously understaffed
slow service
lot of employee move around but the front line which should be serve customer be be ignore
no one seem to care
i go on a sunday night and -PRON- be incredibly easy to get in
the complimentary admission pass be even lie in pile in the casino restroom for anyone to pick up
the security guy tend the line let -PRON- in very quickly
the other security guy stand on the stair lead down from the line to the entrance be quite nice too tell -PRON- enjoy -PRON- evening
perhaps come on a sunday night influence -PRON- positive opinion of the place but here go
i find the appearance and atmosphere of the club to be very sophisticated and exotic
the waterfall be of course the centerpiece of tryst as -PRON- overlook the outdoor lagoon area
-PRON- be a great place to get some fresh air although during the summer heat even at nighttime the open air will not cool -PRON- down
there be two main bar at least from what i notice and service be very fast
even when the peak rush of the crowd arrive at the club i do not have to wait very long to get a bartender 's attention
-PRON- inredible hulk be some the good -PRON- have ever have and -PRON- quickly become obvious why -PRON- use hennessy vsop in -PRON- hulk not the regular vs that everyone else use with varied result
the long island be a little strong no complaint there and cheap than the outrageously price $ 17 long island at the bank but i still think the bank have the good long island
the dancefloor be not too big or too small
-PRON- seem to -PRON- that a large portion of the club 's floor space be devote to table and booth which i think make the place appear more intimate
however a modestly sized dancefloor and many table could be a disaster on peak night like saturday
but in -PRON- case the whole setup be nice because i go on a sunday and the crowd size be just right
the restroom be nice the sink remind -PRON- of the bathroom in the harry potter movie
the complimentary pass say that the music for the night be to be 70 80 and 90 mash up
that make -PRON- very hesitant to go at first because i hate mash up
but -PRON- turn out -PRON- do not do too many mash up at all
-PRON- play mostly 90 and 2000s hip hop and dance music so i be happy for the most part
as bloomfield resident -PRON- be excited to have a new japanese restaurant in -PRON- neighborhood
-PRON- enjoy fukuda 's offering during the little italy day and come in with high expectation
the place be very small but warm and invite
the decor be very artful and creative give -PRON- a feeling that -PRON- be somewhere special
even down to the menu which be print on a slim strip of paper which resemble a bookmark
-PRON- be simple small and concise
-PRON- feel very modern and japanese
so why be -PRON- only give this place 3 star
-PRON- because -PRON- leave unimpressed
maybe -PRON- come in with high expectation and expect more for the price
however -PRON- can not help how -PRON- feel
-PRON- do not mind pay a top dollar for japanese food
but -PRON- feel blatantly rip off
the sushi be decent but the serving be minuscule
-PRON- also order the simmer pork belly which be how -PRON- would have expect pork belly should be do
which be quite good
however for $ 10.50 -PRON- only get about 4 tiny little sliver
-PRON- devour -PRON-
after polish off the pork belly -PRON- overly enthusiastic server plop down a large serving of this glorious pork belly which have about 8 sliver less fatty and look crispier
-PRON- be so happy thinking to -PRON-
oh this be a good deal
however -PRON- be disappointed to find out that this second large and better look serving of pork belly be not really destine for -PRON- table but the table next too -PRON- thank to -PRON- wife 's honesty
this inconsistency be unacceptable when -PRON- be charge this much
and then -PRON- happen again
-PRON- keep on plop down other people 's food on -PRON- table
which -PRON- decline
please improve
-PRON- may feel like -PRON- be do well since the place look pack every time -PRON- walk by during -PRON- dog walk
however there be tough competition down the street and people be go to realize -PRON- be not get -PRON- money 's worth
-PRON- serving be half the size for almost double the cost and same quality as -PRON- competitor
please be consistent
-PRON- would like for -PRON- guy to stay in -PRON- neighborhood to improve -PRON- business district
-PRON- be in pittsburgh -PRON- market can not stand pretentious rendition of something that be already good to begin with
sorry this be a late night rant
-PRON- wake up from sleep and start think about -PRON- experience at -PRON- place this evening
-PRON- would have to say from when -PRON- be young until now -PRON- father 's cooking be the good -PRON- have ever eat
-PRON- dream have always be to display and ask everyone appreciate the talent and passion -PRON- have for food
the experience thought and technique -PRON- father use be in all honesty prestigious
-PRON- urge everyone to give the restaurant a try and write a review to help -PRON- father and -PRON- partner succeed
-PRON- be more than positive that -PRON- will not be disappoint in -PRON- food as -PRON- also have a sharp tongue -PRON-
work in the steel building there be some sad option to choose from at lunch time
luckily craft work be one of two option the other be
istanbul grille that satiate the hungry without have to eat overpriced chain fast food
everything -PRON- have eat here have be great
-PRON- favorite by far be the porkgasm sandwich
pull pork cheddar pickle chipotle mayo and barbecue sauce
this sandwich be a go to when -PRON- be have a bad day that can only be make good with food
the breakfast sandwich and burrito be fresh and delicious every time
-PRON- also serve coffee which be great if -PRON- be not a fan of starbucks like -PRON-
-PRON- would stay away from this location
-PRON- go here order dine in the food be typical for what -PRON- would expect
-PRON- issue come when -PRON- attempt to submit payment use a pizza hut e gift card
-PRON- be tell by the manager maurice that -PRON- could not use -PRON- there because this location be a corporate location keep in mind that -PRON- have use e gift card with maurice at this location before
-PRON- can tell by the suspicious look -PRON- give the card when -PRON- submit -PRON- to -PRON- something be up
maurice even claim to have attempt to use card and -PRON- be reject
-PRON- watch -PRON- -PRON- make no attempt
so -PRON- call corporate and be tell that the e gift card be usable at all pizza huts
-PRON- then ask maurice for -PRON- boss name and number to which -PRON- reply that -PRON- could not give out -PRON- number
so -PRON- leave all of -PRON- contact info for -PRON- to call -PRON-
-PRON- finally receive a follow up call be tell -PRON- call -PRON- back because -PRON- call corp not because maurice tell -PRON- to call -PRON- like -PRON- request to which -PRON- be tell that only franchise location accept e gift card
to which -PRON- reply how be customer suppose to discern between corp and franchise location and why would -PRON- put that determination on customer
-PRON- do not get as much as an apology for the embarrassment
this situation cause -PRON- from maurice the manager or kate the district manager
kate also think -PRON- be some other customer that try to use a e gift card and -PRON- accept -PRON- as a courtesy
but -PRON- be not afford the same
kate also state that -PRON- do not accept e card yet maurice claim to have try to enter -PRON- but could not this card be a pizza hut product
funny thing -PRON- give the e card to a friend and -PRON- use -PRON- via the net for delivery with no problem
-PRON- even call corp back once more and request for someone else to call -PRON-
no one bother
be not expect much and not much end up happen
from the beginning there be no line for -PRON- nye event that state will call so -PRON- be be toss amongst confused employee
after enter -PRON- show a screenshot of -PRON- confirmation number to the girl at check in\/coat check
-PRON- say that -PRON- have to see -PRON- screenshot say 2 ticket in order to let -PRON- in
the confirmation number mean nothing
then -PRON- show -PRON- another screenshot of ga seat x and ga seat y see photo
-PRON- mean clearly that mean 2 different ticket
-PRON- still say -PRON- need to say 2 ticket so after step to the side and try to bring up -PRON- itinerary with m life -PRON- manage to get this particular screen to display
the sass and attitude flip and -PRON- try to say ooh open bar til 11
lol
terrible
guess what
after contact lax 's facebook page via a message -PRON- have say there be no open bar
there be no advertisement of -PRON- on -PRON- promo photo but -PRON- turn out that -PRON- actually do have open bar from 9 11
clearly there be idiot work for lax but as -PRON- say from the get go
-PRON- do not expect much
there be a reason for all -PRON- awful review
stay far away

the shop be so hot
-PRON- be sweat
-PRON- ice cream arrive half melt
kinda pricy for melted ice cream
table service be slow and spotty
this be -PRON- first time here and -PRON- be not sure -PRON- will be back
-PRON- think that this place would be fun for -PRON- date night
not really
have to totally agree with the previous reviewer who note if -PRON- do not have the prerequisite stay away
from the time -PRON- walk in -PRON- can feel the snobby atmosphere
-PRON- really do not feel welcome
have a facial and although -PRON- be good -PRON- have have just as good facial at holt renfrew 's spa and -PRON- make -PRON- feel relaxed welcome and at home
good pizza in town
very friendly service always get and fresh make with good ingredient
-PRON- highly recommend this place and -PRON- eat here weekly
-PRON- have be here a few time
so -PRON- be time to review
food -PRON- have only have the southpoint cut medium rare with the salad
salad be -PRON- usual bag lettuce with usual veggie
-PRON- have have the rice pilaf which be tastey as well as the baked potato
the server need to learn how to portion the butter and sour cream that -PRON- add to the potatos
a small potato should not come with a glob of butter almost the same size as the potato ruin -PRON-
the prime rib however have always be great
well season not overly fatty always cook right
desert be satisfactory
peach bread pudding be very dense
cheesecake be run of the mill
service be nothing to write home about
-PRON- server take a while to do anything
after -PRON- be do eat -PRON- still have some wine to finish
and -PRON- want to rush -PRON- out
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- be go to stay and chat while -PRON- finish -PRON- bottle and -PRON- never see -PRON- again
-PRON- take -PRON- 25 minute from -PRON- tell -PRON- that until -PRON- be able to get someone attention to take -PRON- credit card
-PRON- helper\/busser have ther personality of a smash kitty
even try to engage in conversation with -PRON- all -PRON- get be a blank stare
be local -PRON- recognize -PRON- accent and even ask -PRON- where -PRON- be from to try to spark up convo since -PRON- be not busy
still just a stare
very weird since -PRON- also work in service industry
atmosphere very clean and tasteful
-PRON- be not very busy during the saturday night 630pm dinner rush
-PRON- do have one large table of drunkerd next to -PRON- and -PRON- would think that -PRON- would sit small table away from those type
be hard to hold a decent conversation at -PRON- own table with a table of 18 drunk next to -PRON-
overall -PRON- think -PRON- be worth $ 15 for a full prime rib dinner
the service\/management definitely need to be work on though
$ 100 for a wash wax buff and seal
richard say -PRON- would take 1 hour for everything which seem like a sort amount of time to get everything do
much to -PRON- surprise -PRON- be do in less than 45 minute
while the car look good -PRON- could see the issue still
water spot on the window exhaust tip still cover in black carbon dust
the wheel still have some brake dust
call -PRON- crazy
but -PRON- know wax alone take time especially when -PRON- be do by hand which -PRON- be tell this be
-PRON- do buff out a scratch -PRON- mention but -PRON- do not buff the whole car as -PRON- be tell -PRON- would
this make -PRON- think there be no sealant to put on the paint either
probably a marketing gimmick as -PRON- automate car wash have the sealant add there
for as good as the car look -PRON- would have gladly pay $ 40 at most
would -PRON- go back
no
-PRON- would rather spend the 3 hour -PRON- take -PRON- to do -PRON- -PRON- and save $ 100 or spend that $ 100 at danny 's family car wash where -PRON- can see that -PRON- have do everything -PRON- say -PRON- would
granted danny 's be also a ripoff
the good customer service a little pricy but get a lot of food per order
great tasting and lot of sauce choice
the way -PRON- think of indian flame be this in america -PRON- have get -PRON- local pizzeria and fast food place where -PRON- can pop in grab -PRON- normal unspectacular but reliable meal
well pretend for a second -PRON- be in india and -PRON- have tje same proclivity for fast food)
indian flame would be -PRON- destination
-PRON- be not try to hide anything or be more than -PRON- really be
rather -PRON- be a hey i'm make indian food want some approach
-PRON- be not come here for a date or to spend excess amount of time
rather if -PRON- have a tooth for indian and do not want to make a big deal of the situation -PRON- know -PRON- can count on what this restaurant provide food not a dining experience
the decor be decent though -PRON- may find -PRON- star at the bright paint color for a while but if -PRON- be like -PRON- -PRON- probably will not mind
dinner menu be large than -PRON- would think give the cafeteria feel to the place and the small number of table
-PRON- really can not beat the lunch buffet price though -PRON- can probably easily beat the selection and quality on the salty side too
the one downside to the hey -PRON- be make indian food want any approach be that the service leave much to be desire -PRON- drink will not be refill unless -PRON- call a server over to help
this be about as far east as -PRON- will want to be on euclid
some shady thing go down the first time -PRON- be there
-PRON- love this place
-PRON- coworker and -PRON- order from there probably 2 3 time a week on the high end but at least once a week usually
food be always amazingly delicious and still hot when -PRON- get deliver to -PRON-
depend on who be cook be conservative with -PRON- spicy level selection
-PRON- be a scale of 1 10 but unless -PRON- be use to turn purple lose all sensation on -PRON- tongue and sweating while -PRON- eat keep -PRON- under a 5
highly recommend if -PRON- like good thai food and do not care for fancy table setting and ambiance
great utilization of a space that need to be reborn
seat setup be versatile cozy for a couple or select a giant booth for group
drink menu be a bit overwhelming as -PRON- be page of option but love what -PRON- order
service be friendly
lot of staff on a busy friday night
however make -PRON- wait at bar for a table and when -PRON- sit -PRON- -PRON- see that there be plenty of open table in the seated area
seem pretentious
-PRON- recommend start off with a couple of martini -PRON- recommend the cucumber martini and the miso black cod and -PRON- will be in heaven
-PRON- get a couple of roll but -PRON- have to say that -PRON- be not impressed with the sushi-
-PRON- have have good
-PRON- be very disappointed in the sushi
stick with the signature dish and -PRON- will not go wrong
if -PRON- like a little heat -PRON- recommend the pepper as an app every 7th pepper as a kick
-PRON- never know what -PRON- be go to get and -PRON- be delicious
friendly and knowledgeable staff with a great atmosphere
love this place
be in las vegas and stumble upon this gem
-PRON- wife and -PRON- be big pizza fan
this place have great pizza and atmosphere
-PRON- pizza be delicious and hot
the crust which -PRON- make daily be perfect and the topping be fresh and generous
the place -PRON- be spotless the bathroom be some of the clean -PRON- have ever see at restaurant
the employee be kind and very attentive
-PRON- will definitely come back to sunset pizza on -PRON- next trip to las vegas
-PRON- just get -PRON- haircut here on saturday
and -PRON- think the service be good
-PRON- just want a trim and -PRON- only give -PRON- a trim just what -PRON- want
place be clean and everyone seem friendly
-PRON- would go back here again to get another haircut
-PRON- strongly discourage anyone from order
-PRON- send -PRON- friend such an ugly cookie -PRON- have attach the picture
-PRON- be not sure why -PRON- would make the hear orange why the border be wonky and messy and why the heart be distort
when -PRON- reach out to -PRON- -PRON- say that the cookie look fine in -PRON- opinion
but -PRON- be suppose to satisfy the customer not -PRON-
-PRON- also mention how art be subjective meanwhile everyone -PRON- have show this cookie to agree that -PRON- ugly
-PRON- will never order again
-PRON- do not seem to care about satisfy -PRON- customer
pay $ 60 for a terrible look cookie send to a friend who really need a pick -PRON- up
-PRON- be embarrassing
food be great but seating be a slight issue
the place be small and -PRON- may end up wait a little bit before seating
-PRON- love pink 's anywhere -PRON- go
this however feel like a clean less greasy less 50-plus old hot dog joint
although -PRON- do like that feeling nothing beat the feeling of the original place
the dog be the same except -PRON- have some different one here
-PRON- do not think -PRON- have see
-PRON- stick to what -PRON- know which be the chili cheese bacon dog
-PRON- be still delicious
this location be definitely vegas ed up
meaning -PRON- be get those super cool daquiri cup in many large size and -PRON- have a lot of outdoor seating with water fan go on constantly
the line and wait here be not as long as -PRON- would be in la so -PRON- would have to say that be a plus especially since -PRON- be wait in 100 degree heat for some hot dog
if -PRON- be ever in vegas -PRON- say visit
but if -PRON- be look to experience the original check out la
-PRON- google good sweet potato fry in las vegas and this be the number one result
google do not steer -PRON- wrong
absolutely fantastic
the burger be amazing as well
not the most friendly front desk staff
elevator have graffiti type writing in -PRON- etch on the metal
the room be super date
bathroom tile miss grout and need redone
the breakfast be actually decent scramble egg and sausage with the other usual cold stuff
-PRON- be fine for a place to sleep but nothing special
-PRON- would recommend come here if -PRON- be the close one to -PRON- house and -PRON- have a lot of time
the first time -PRON- come to this salon be for an eyebrow wax now as a walk in -PRON- know there be go to be a wait
but -PRON- be not ready for a thirty minute
wait as the person who do the waxing be call in from wherever -PRON- have be home pick up the kid etc
when the waxing be do -PRON- have do a great job
so long wait time no apology and a great result
the second time -PRON- come to this salon be for a mani pedi as -PRON- have read another reviewer rave about -PRON- package now as a walk in yet again -PRON- know there be go to be a wait
but the problem be not that the chair be full in fact there be multiple chair available
-PRON- be once again that there be not enough staff to take care of the client
this wait time in case -PRON- be wonder be over an hour
yeah over an hour -PRON- wait because -PRON- have time to waste and -PRON- be play law and order svu on -PRON- tv
-PRON- wait in the lobby area for about twenty minute
then -PRON- sit -PRON- in a spa chair with no water in the foot area for 40 minute until someone finally come over to help -PRON-
-PRON- be pretty particular about -PRON- pedicure in fact very particular but not in a horrific kind of way-- -PRON- like french tip slim line
for some reason the woman who be take care of -PRON- could not quite understand what -PRON- mean when -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- want the line thin each time -PRON- slimm the white down -PRON- be so minimal that -PRON- would have be sit there for yet another hour just whittle away at the line until -PRON- meet -PRON- specification so
now -PRON- have thick french pedicure line on -PRON- toesie
-PRON- be not rat this place what -PRON- would rate -PRON- which would be a 1 if there be a few more nail place nearby but there be not and -PRON- do an awesome job with the eyebrow and an okay job on the nail with an exhaustive wait time
-PRON- will reluctantly be return
what a terrible experience
do not rent here
first of all -PRON- say -PRON- be at the main car rental area
but
no
so -PRON- have to take a 15 min plus ride to the main area
and then -PRON- have to get another shuttle to a second location
that location be 15 min further away
so when -PRON- finally arrive -PRON- be greet by an insane line and only three people be help customer
not to mention -PRON- take 10 min per person as -PRON- attempt to upsell the customer to the next car category
so finally -PRON- think -PRON- do right
wrong
-PRON- take -PRON- paper and go to the lot guy and ask -PRON- which car be yours
-PRON- reply
there be none
-PRON- just walk off
3 min later -PRON- wonder back and oops
-PRON- do not have -PRON- reserved car type
so -PRON- can have that low model instead
by this point -PRON- do not care because -PRON- can see another line to drive -PRON- car off the lot
all tell
-PRON- arrive at 10 a.m. and drive off the lot at 11:30
-PRON- be just as incompetent on the return
no one be there to receive the car on -PRON- return and when -PRON- finally find a guy -PRON- sign -PRON- paper and send -PRON- to the damn inside to cash out with the cashier
this be another 10 person line
not to mention the two shuttle in reverse
-PRON- have never have such a bad car rental experience and -PRON- will never use this company again
the atmosphere and the design of the place be really cool
the food be great and the 20 student discount be amazing
definitely come back again soon

come here for dessert and drink
service be excellent and so be the dessert
the atmosphere be relaxed authentic and end the night in a great way
thank to jp for the great service
-PRON- have not be here since the inaugural year -PRON- open and this time around -PRON- like
although there be not that many more addition than the first time -PRON- feel more like a theme park for some reason
there be only 1 addition of a ride which be the tornado and slide boarding
if -PRON- remember correctly the slide boarding ride already exist all -PRON- do be add the game feature
since this as new for this season only gold pass holder could ride -PRON- kind of a bummer
but w\/e. tornado be definitely the most popular along with rattler but -PRON- will say rattler be -PRON- favorite
there be actually an identical ride to tornado at the other park but that one be a bit more thrill seek and on edge
this summer -PRON- be able to visit both park and can honestly say wnw hand down be the good option
not only be -PRON- the cheap option but feel more like a true water park
another significant difference be the kid 's area
wnw pretty much sh*ts on -PRON- because the other place have one
but -PRON- be tiny
wnw also have a sunscreen station provide by comprehensive cancer clinics which the other do not but should have
there be also grassy area where people set up tent and blanket which -PRON- think look fun
something definitely to consider if -PRON- be come with a group of kid
-PRON- big gripe would have to be the pay for parking this be vegas where parking be free
pay for parking be simply preposterous
food option be about the same at both because -PRON- be decent theme park food
wnw deserve 4 star kind of surprised -PRON- be still at an average of 3
if -PRON- be contemplate on which park to take the kid to wnw all the way
great place
-PRON- love a place where -PRON- can come and get great beverage great food and great service
exceptional staff impeccable food and attentive management
-PRON- highly recommend -PRON- come here and enjoy beverage and food from guy
management be always present and attentive
joe the manager be more than personable and memorable to say the least
hit -PRON- up
kw
this be the best lunch place
great menu
steak salad be amazing
-PRON- be so sad -PRON- close for weekday lunch
-PRON- be a special place to take birthday friend
-PRON- get a regular hot dog
-PRON- be not -PRON- cup of tea
maybe next time -PRON- will try a burger
the place be cute
-PRON- serve shasta soda
-PRON- have to give that thumb down
-PRON- really enjoy the vegan food here and think -PRON- be well price
if -PRON- be look for new\/unique dim sum item -PRON- will not get -PRON- here
what spring villa do well be -PRON- typical staple dim sum dish but execute good than the average
a bit more expensive than other dim sum place around the area
the reason -PRON- come to vegas the buffet
sadly i be hungover so i be not feel 100 but i know what good food taste like nonetheless
-PRON- look up the good buffet in vegas and the buffet at the hilton be among the top 3 in all the review -PRON- check
the sushi bar be the good and probably the main reason to come back
the slider be super tasty as be the pizza and other seafood
the dessert option be definitely the cherry on top
-PRON- would come back for sure
one of the good meal -PRON- girlfriend
and -PRON- have have
from begin to end everything be fantastic
-PRON- have the peruvian stew grill street corn flank steak and creamy grit
the food be a bit spicy so be prepare
finish with the churro and milkshake combo
and -PRON- be great
drink be tasty and service awesome as well
highly suggest
perplexed by the lack of service at origin north
-PRON- waitress be very attentive at first
but then -PRON- do not see -PRON- for the rest of the meal
-PRON- hostess be the one who refill -PRON- water and after wait an hour between -PRON- appetizer salmon sushi pizza hand roll cone watermelon salad + truffle mushroom burrata -PRON- main have not arrive
for this -PRON- do get complimentary dessert nitrogen oxide ice cream
overall -PRON- meal take 4 hour and -PRON- leave feel tired and ignore
as much as -PRON- love claudio on masterchef not sure if the restaurant empire be work so well for -PRON-
this be -PRON- favorite thai restaurant in vegas
the food be authentic the entertainment be just the good
service be on point and -PRON- be always open
-PRON- can not beat the price
-PRON- experience with valley protective service have be a delight -PRON- do what -PRON- do to get the job do right
keep up the good work guy
savory crepe selection be tiny and -PRON- smoothie end up be a slushie
good crepe elsewhere
stay away
this place be horrible
some of the bad service -PRON- have ever receive
unfortunately this be the only place for -PRON- to get warranty work do
as soon as -PRON- can get everth fix -PRON- will never be back
if -PRON- still choose to do business with these folk do not say -PRON- be not warn
-PRON- will be sorry
wow
can not recommend this place enough
the pancake be huge and delicious
the completely homemade corned beef hash be unbelievably amazing
this be a true treasure hide away
-PRON- would not generally go to this extent but accord to -PRON- wife that manage in a customer service base industry -PRON- urge -PRON- to share -PRON- experience as -PRON- wish more would do so for -PRON-
the good the bad and the ugly
the good
-PRON- be not generally a pep boys customer but think -PRON- would give -PRON- guy a try
-PRON- be guarantee
that when -PRON- drop -PRON- truck off on a sunday afternoon that the new tire would be instal and -PRON- front end alignment complete by 4 p.m. that day as -PRON- have to go to work
-PRON- show up at 3:50pm and one tire be off
kind of a bummer as -PRON- have a bulge tire but need -PRON- truck nonetheless
-PRON- be very reasonable and could see that the store be extremely busy
mike the manager be a very calm understanding individual that tell -PRON- -PRON- would give -PRON- a good deal if -PRON- come back to get the tire
-PRON- make an appointment for the next day
-PRON- be be extremely understanding and be the reason -PRON- decide to come back
the bad
two hour before -PRON- come back for -PRON- appointment
-PRON- receive a voicemail that state the alignment tech leave at 5 p.m. so -PRON- would need to be there at 4 p.m. to complete the work
-PRON- arrive at 4:07 and be tell that due to 3 vehicle be before -PRON- that the alignment could not be accomplish
fairly frustrated yet calm -PRON- speak with mike again and -PRON- thank -PRON- for -PRON- patience and reward -PRON- with a discount on the alignment
so -PRON- get the tire do and make and appointment for the next morning to guarantee completion
-PRON- be type this as -PRON- alignment be be complete
the ugly
this next point be why after this service -PRON- will unfortunately probably never visit this location again
a customer service employee by the name of sergio make -PRON- want to walk out of the store\/ loose -PRON- mind with the way -PRON- be treat -PRON- belittle fellow employee and undermine -PRON- manager in the presence of other employee and customer
absolutely unacceptable
to the level at which -PRON- take -PRON- poor attitude make -PRON- not only an extremely poor employee but a bad person overall
example 1
-PRON- belittle another employee -PRON- believe bob old man that -PRON- do not know how to do -PRON- job and can not set an appointment correctly
then proceed to complain about how -PRON- have to do bob 's job and
-PRON- and nothing could get do in front of -PRON- yet do not offer to show -PRON- how to do -PRON-
yet -PRON- guarantee -PRON- appointment that could not be fulfil
2 when -PRON- try to pay -PRON- invoice after -PRON- tire be instal
-PRON- have a question about the road hazard warranty and bob have a question where to find a link\/literature that -PRON- be ask for
-PRON- then begin to belittle -PRON- again and zero -PRON- invoice and have to start from square one
during the process -PRON- repeatedly ask for a pamphlet or literature on the road hazard program and the only thing -PRON- could come up with be -PRON- give -PRON- -PRON- word
-PRON- would be pro rat
ha
this person word be as useful as a poopy flavor lollipop
due to -PRON- action -PRON- decline the $ 89.99 road hazard warranty
again this be due to -PRON- action alone
-PRON- can only imagine how much capital this could cost a company in the long run
and the icing on the cake with sergio 3 as -PRON- re do -PRON- invoice -PRON- could sense -PRON- disgust and -PRON- anxiety soar
-PRON- -PRON- n haw and sigh the entire time
when -PRON- sergio originally fix -PRON- invoice -PRON- be $ 110 more than the original invoice
as -PRON- explain -PRON- remember the price match -PRON- include on -PRON- invoice the day prior
then when -PRON- explain that -PRON- be to receive 20 off -PRON- throw -PRON- hand in the air and exclaim how the store will lose money with these handout
-PRON- could not believe -PRON- manager would be dumb enough to offer 20 off on top of a price match
the only thing -PRON- manager may be dumb for be keep -PRON- sergio as an employee
-PRON- be embarrassed for -PRON- company and the other employee that have to work with this person everyday
as a former member of the armed force that know a thing or two about teamwork this individual undermine and lack of teamwork be detrimental to any team success
thank to mike and bob -PRON- may be back
-PRON- can not decide if -PRON- courtesy and humility can outweigh that of -PRON- bad seed sergio
hope this find the correct person
-PRON- have be to tully be a few time now
couple of time just for drink and maybe a pizza
-PRON- have also have dinner there too
every time -PRON- be shocked at how friendly and nice the staff be
the food be great
typical pricing -PRON- think
overall -PRON- find the experience and food to be great
-PRON- highly recommend stop in and check -PRON- out for -PRON-
from read the other review -PRON- be a little shocked
not sure if -PRON- go to the same place -PRON- do
okay let -PRON- start with the positive
the food be good
-PRON- have the chicken parm and -PRON- be good value for -PRON- money
the location be good
parking be quite acceptable
now for the stuff that do not please -PRON- 1 the colossal carrot cake be barefac false advertising
-PRON- be not large or big
-PRON- be not even average in size for the $ 6.99 -PRON- charge
2 the washroom be in the basement and there be no handicapped washroom on the main level
3 dark
-PRON- have to use -PRON- cell phone flashlight to read the menu
the menu be black
4
no debit
this be the deal breaker for -PRON-
-PRON- accept cash or credit
-PRON- have no cash with -PRON- and do not have a credit card
the server say that -PRON- would have to use the atm
-PRON- get clip $ 2 at the machine
-PRON- leave no tip and do not feel bad
the service be adequate but if -PRON- do tip -PRON- would have be 10 15 max
-PRON- would not recommend this place
-had to get -PRON- own towel -no housekeeping unless -PRON- stay for 7 day -PRON- stay for 6
our bathroom door lock -PRON- -PRON- be lock out for the night
call front desk at 8 p.m. say -PRON- would put a note on -PRON- account for matience to fix -PRON-
-PRON- fiancé be without a restroom for the entire night -PRON- be pregnant
-PRON- try everything to open the door for -PRON-
staff do not even offer -PRON- a restroom inform -PRON- matience do not get in till 6:30am
-PRON- call in the morning and matience be still not in
this be now push 12 hour without use of -PRON- bathroom\/shower\/sink
-PRON- end up try to jiggle the door open and -PRON- hand go through -PRON-
the hotel end up charge -PRON- $ 193 for the door which be truly only cost $ 30 to fix
-PRON- pregnant fiance be without the restroom for the night and morning
the staff should of offer -PRON- a new room have a key at the front desk or alternative restroom especially because -PRON- fiancé be pregnant
-PRON- will not stay here again merely because of this situation
-steven d
excellent service excellent coffee
great place for a small informal meeting or catch up with friend
instead of -PRON- employee worry about where people park
how about after the last 8 year
and -PRON- be sell and rename -PRON- company have do the bare minimum to update thing
every time the steam room pick and choose when -PRON- want to work so -PRON- clientele have to spend an extra 20 minute to a half hour hop that -PRON- kick on to actually get steam
also -PRON- would think with the amount of money that -PRON- customer pay per month to come here -PRON- would think the water on the ground in the steam room and in the sauna and or on the pool deck would actually drain into a drain
maybe -PRON- could resolve the problem with -PRON- lifeguard have -PRON- actually do something besides play on -PRON- cell phone like squeegee the floor or fix -PRON-
-PRON- be pathetic that -PRON- want the amount of money that -PRON- do and -PRON- establishment be way under bar
and to complain about the parking
why do not -PRON- finally resurface the lot or have some new line paint because apparently -PRON- customer do not know how to park correctly across the board
or put camera in so -PRON- can have people on video slam -PRON- door of other vehicle
shitty service manager be a moron say -PRON- need all part for a cable warrenty want a joke
do not go here
loser
people rave about cornerstone
-PRON- have be twice over a span of time and not visit be ok
not at all horrible
but nothing make -PRON- jump out of -PRON- seat
-PRON- be a cute place with outdoor seating and to -PRON- the food be average
both time -PRON- would be there for brunch and have pancake and egg
maybe -PRON- will give -PRON- another shot during a different time of day
maybe
beautiful new location with a super convenient drive thru
-PRON- favorite staff from the old location over on mayo
so excited to have -PRON- guy right next door
if -PRON- have another shop -PRON- can go to -PRON- should go there
-PRON- be a frequent customer at -PRON- fix -PRON- after -PRON- car break down on -PRON- doorstep while -PRON- be pick up -PRON- dog at the nearby scottsdale pet hotel awesome place by the way
-PRON- be grossly overcharge by -PRON- fix
-PRON- $ 2000 repair but that be par for the course
so -PRON- be not overly concerned
-PRON- mistake be give -PRON- repeat business and think that andreas the owner would be a reasonable professional
-PRON- have additional issue interesting also electrical which -PRON- say -PRON- fix the first time and need -PRON- car fix before drive across the country for a job change
-PRON- fix -PRON- know this have two week to fix -PRON- car and complete the repair
well that be what -PRON- think another 500$.
the car didn't make it 5 hour down the road before have the exact
same issue they say they fixed
now -PRON- be stuck on the side of the highway in gallup nm and have to get a tow to a dealer for yet another repair
have to leave -PRON- car there to make -PRON- across the country in time and then pay to get it shipped
when -PRON- notify andreas the owner -PRON- feign shock and concern
-PRON- obviously be not really concerned at all
-PRON- ask -PRON- to help -PRON- with the bill -PRON- refuse
-PRON- ask -PRON- to split -PRON- with -PRON- since -PRON- obviously do not adequately repair -PRON- car
andreas say -PRON- be not -PRON- problem there be no way for -PRON- to know
why do the exact same thing happen then
why do the mechanic in gallup say -PRON- be extremely likely but not 100 provable that -PRON- miss something -PRON- should have catch
why would not a business owner help out a repeat customer in this situation
here be the kicker the good offer -PRON- get from andreas be 100 $ and free oil change for a year
free oil change for a year
when he know i'm leaving arizona
what a disgrace
if -PRON- like get rip off and treat like garbage by an owner who fail to take responsibility for a mistake because -PRON- have too much pride to admit -PRON- be possible -PRON- business be not perfect by all mean go to -PRON- fix -PRON-
otherwise like -PRON- say -PRON- would find another place
any other place
this place aggravate -PRON-
the location be good the food be good and that be about all -PRON- can think of
that be good about -PRON-
-PRON- have such potential though
firstly who want to be force to valet when try to have a quick lunch
the main complaint be the service
-PRON- sit at the bar to have a drink and an appetizer while -PRON- be wait for -PRON- haircut
-PRON- have 45 minute so -PRON- think that be plenty of time
-PRON- be not
there be one blonde hot bartendress who be obviously not hire for -PRON- skill
-PRON- take -PRON- 10 minute to get -PRON- menu and water and then another 15 of try -PRON- hard to get -PRON- attention to put in -PRON- order
the food come quickly and -PRON- be delicious but this girl spend half of the time talk to two guy at the end of the bar and the other half on -PRON- cell texting
by the end -PRON- be stand with cash in -PRON- hand to try to get to -PRON- haircut on time
-PRON- also short change -PRON-
-PRON- bill be $ 10.27 and -PRON- give -PRON- a $ 20
-PRON- give -PRON- $ 9 back
-PRON- feel cheat because -PRON- keep -PRON- $ .73 as a tip
-PRON- do not deserve that at all
ps

omg
where do -PRON- start
first of all -PRON- really do not care for buffet's(chinese especially
but decide to give this place a try after see a delicious plate of crab leg post by a friend of mine on facebook
-PRON- look so fresh and tasty
-PRON- ask -PRON- about the place and tell -PRON- -PRON- be locate in chandler
so -PRON- husband and -PRON- decide to have dinner there yesterday
-PRON- get there and -PRON- be greet nicely
the staff be nice and friendly which be probably the only plus side up
but come to the food
most of -PRON- be horrible
the crab leg that draw -PRON- in to go there which -PRON- could not wait to dig into be a total disappointment
soggy and runny with water drip out from everywhere
tasteless
not a firmness of texture anywhere
and the butter
not salty at all -PRON- do not even taste like butter
-PRON- do not know what -PRON- be
-PRON- just leave a tasteless oily feel to -PRON- lip
and most of the food look and taste like -PRON- be sit out for hour
the only decent dish -PRON- have be the fry rice and beef with broccoli and eggroll
everything else be hardly fresh and not good tasting at all
and another disgusting dish that -PRON- see that -PRON- serve be frog leg
gross
no thank
-PRON- be sure the same grease that -PRON- use to fry -PRON- thing in be the same one -PRON- use to fry everything else
disgusting
lastly and overall very expensive for low quality cold and old food
not to mention that -PRON- ceiling be very disgusting
black dirty and filthy
never again be -PRON- go back
fukuburger
try say that without offend someone
-PRON- be a bit of a shame that this awesome little burger shop be kind of hide on the strip
-PRON- be locate in the hawaiian marketplace an area -PRON- have no idea exist
-PRON- be definitely worth the trip
the first thing -PRON- notice be that the inside be cool
there be a lot go on on the wall this sort of anime art on the wall
-PRON- seem like a great place just to hang out
-PRON- also have a few tv go on and be not too busy
also the music be on point
-PRON- be play drake big sean kendrick lamar etc
the other awesome thing be when -PRON- order -PRON- food -PRON- give -PRON- a joke name -PRON- have to call out when -PRON- order be ready
-PRON- go with the ever reliable tig ole bitties
-PRON- think that be a fun touch to the standard fast food affair
as for the food the tamago egg burger be -PRON- 1 burger and -PRON- can not argue
-PRON- can never go wrong with a fry egg on a burger and the crispy onion string add a nice crunch and saltiness to the burger
the wasabi mayo add a touch of heat but be not slather on there
the buta pig burger be also great
-PRON- be a lot of meat as -PRON- be a burger patty with smoke bacon and bbq sauce and the wasabi mayo
again -PRON- be a ton of meat and flavor
definitely feel like -PRON- get -PRON- money 's worth with the burger
-PRON- also should not skip the fry when -PRON- be here
-PRON- have crack fry there and yes -PRON- be fantastic
-PRON- spend probably over an hour in there just relax and eat this delicious food
also -PRON- have american ninja warrior on the tv
and -PRON- get into -PRON-
even the people work there get into the show as well
that be just a mark of a place that do not take -PRON- too seriously
provide good service and have a fun time as well
when the people work there be have fun -PRON- be bind to have fun as well
get a burger here
enjoy -PRON-

am a little disappointed that -PRON- have such a high turnover of bar tender
some be go and some be no longer behind the bar
again the service have always be good
but -PRON- do like go to place and see the same face behind the bar
nice when -PRON- be always go from home and can find a place like home
one of nodas hot spot
-PRON- have be to cabo fish taco for the last few year
this place be awesomely delicious
let -PRON- start from the very beginning when -PRON- sit down -PRON- be greet by some chip and salsa
but not just any kind of salsa corn salsa
the salsa be a good mix of sweet and regular salsa y
the chip add a nice saltiness to -PRON-
then the margaritas be refresh with a good balance of sweetness and tequila
-PRON- always get the mahi mahi fish taco with usually one of -PRON- taco special
-PRON- love how -PRON- can mix and match the different taco
the tortilla -PRON- be serve on be hard to describe
-PRON- be more flaky and light than -PRON- average flour tortilla
the ingredient in the taco be very fresh and flavorful
lastly -PRON- be always crave the jalapeño mash potato because -PRON- be the good mash potato -PRON- have ever have
however -PRON- be only serve as a seasonal side
so -PRON- be disappointed when -PRON- be not an option and have to get -PRON- second favorite of the slaw
this be a must try restaurant if -PRON- be in noda
this mall be amazing
what -PRON- love about vaughan mill be that there be actually parking and -PRON- do not feel as if -PRON- be claustrophobic around everyone like at other mall yorkdale eaton centre honestly this be defiantly one of -PRON- favourite mall around
-PRON- have everyone and many deal
if -PRON- be look for a great mall come here
so -PRON- buy a coupon

hubby be pescatarian
so -PRON- order the 2 veggie one melon with and mushroom
-PRON- think -PRON- be
-PRON- be both steam no option to fry
-PRON- think -PRON- be decent and worth -PRON- especially if -PRON- get a coupon
great lunch spot if -PRON- be in the area
mysteriously -PRON- always have plenty of free table despite put together a pretty impressive array of mostly-)thai food do well and serve cheaply
the lunch special be fine -PRON- coworker and -PRON- have run the gamut over the year but -PRON- pro tip be to be a little adventurous and read -PRON- actual menu
-PRON- have a cantonese chow mein -PRON- know not particularly thai full of fresh veg and big seafood for a buck more than the special cost
-PRON- also have a crazy giant hot and sour soup with udon noodle and chicken\/beef in -PRON- that will rescue -PRON- from february in toronto
for dinner -PRON- would give this three star the atmosphere be pretty bland the michael buble in heavy rotation can only be appreciate ironically for so long and the presentation be not something -PRON- would try to impress a date with
hit -PRON- for lunch and be happy rather than hit -PRON- for dinner and be underwhelmed
healthy and delicious
go tos chicken hummus plate with the hot sauce and the pickle veggie with hummus
the size of the burger here be crazy especially for the price
-PRON- can get relatively crowd
take quite a bit of time to get -PRON- food
-PRON- do not know who eat the fry but -PRON- be super salty
-PRON- do not normally like to send back food
but -PRON- think -PRON- be go to get hypertension eat the salty fry
-PRON- try rub -PRON- on a napkin before eat -PRON- but that be a lot of fry to wipe down
-PRON- beer selection be just okay
-PRON- be there in october and -PRON- want to try an oktoberfest beer and -PRON- be not impressed with -PRON- option
-PRON- like oktoberfest beer that do not taste like sugar syrup the few and far between
-PRON- like -PRON- fish bowl thingie and honestly -PRON- should have order that with -PRON- husband but -PRON- be not that sort of night
-PRON- have somewhere to be in the morning
this place if very friendly and the pizza be amazing

this be a quick spot for breakfast and very good

however the crepe be freshly make and delicious
-PRON- have a ham crepe with bechamel sauce which be very tasty
and -PRON- man have something that resemble pizza a sausage and mushroom stuff crepe cover in marinara sauce
-PRON- go back another day and -PRON- have the the seafood crepe which be fill with shrimp
both be very good
wow this hotel be the bad
the smell in the room maybe -PRON- be mold and water damage consider the bubble in the wall and the tub and sink would not drain.ive get photo and video
-PRON- be exhaust and do not realize until the morning
-PRON- notify the front desk when -PRON- awake and check out
-PRON- be tell -PRON- would flag the room out of service but -PRON- pay about $ 150.the ceaser palace be amazing and -PRON- like that mgm l
stayaway
this place be a wonderful find
after a day spend at rom and tasting sake and beer in the distillery district -PRON- be hungry and want something good
-PRON- see the sign and run right in
the service be polite and prompt
-PRON- try the appetizer taster plate which be okay
-PRON- would not order roll by -PRON- -PRON- do not think
-PRON- do have the veggie sweet chili rice noodle
-PRON- be really good and actually spicy
the really spicy plate be the spicy fry rice
-PRON- be amazing
-PRON- add the shrimp on top
-PRON- have two order of the grill shrimp with chili lime sauce because the sauce be amazing
the calamari cake be really good too
the sweet potato fry be tasty
-PRON- also each have a beer
-PRON- eat quite a bit and drank and the bill be just over $ 70 which be very reasonable for four people
really great side dish
-PRON- like everything here
-PRON- be a great deal only 19.99 for dinner
16.99 for lunch
the cut of meat be fresh
-PRON- do not rush -PRON- or try to cook -PRON- food for -PRON-
-PRON- like the kalbi and short ribs
-PRON- really can not go wrong with this place
the food be great there duck be a killer and beef with gai lan taste perfect
the food serve be small each dish can only feed 2 people
there duck can serve 4 people easy
not bad at all
come here for lunch
get a chili dog and bacon cheeseburger for less than $ 5
not bad for the price
-PRON- be a small place
however do not expect much
three of -PRON- walk in and sit the bar
both the lady work there look up then go back to what -PRON- be do
one be on -PRON- phone the entire time and be forget customer order leave and right
the beef patty be freeze -PRON- use american cheese fake cheese and white bun
-PRON- basically cook a fast food joint burger which be expect for the price
the chili dog be decent
chili taste good as well as the dog
overall -PRON- be cheap eat
-PRON- can not say the food be amazing but for the money -PRON- be ok
-PRON- would say -PRON- be about the quality of a fast food joint just a little bit better prepare
-PRON- do not like the idea that -PRON- cup of water come from the same faucet where -PRON- wash -PRON- hand though
-PRON- have be come here for more than three year the review be more than long overdue
what do -PRON- think about this place
-PRON- think this be a really awesome building
there be so many thing inside that make -PRON- really cool
there be a doctor 's office a pharmacy an einstein 's and a few other thing health relate on the various that -PRON- be not sure of exactly
and that be all exclude the gym
the gym -PRON- be really cool as well
there be 4 floor total
the first floor compris of the cardio room racquetball court and these thing call mac multipurpose activity court where -PRON- can play basketball and soccer usually
the second floor have the weight and -PRON- have a lot of gym staple
-PRON- surprisingly have bumper plate for those who enjoy olympic lifting
the third floor have 4 full sized basketball court which feel a little bit small than an nba court but this be not the nba
so of course -PRON- be go to be small
the fourth floor have a nice 1\/8 of a mile track which be the typical 400 m track but -PRON- be a small building
so what can -PRON- expect
-PRON- also have a pool -PRON- can access from inside the locker room
this be a really nice facility overall
-PRON- would recommend -PRON- highly because of -PRON- towel service -PRON- provide as well as locker for rent and -PRON- daily locker
-PRON- shower be also partition so -PRON- get -PRON- privacy unlike local gym
the one big thing that anger -PRON- be the people work complain about -PRON- drop the weight
and -PRON- be not the people on the floor but the office worker
-PRON- be not -PRON- fault -PRON- put the weight on the second floor and that the building be a gym
that be -PRON- own fault and -PRON- bug -PRON- when -PRON- tell -PRON- to stop but the people who do olympic lift know what -PRON- be talk about
that be what separate this place from a 5 to -PRON-
okay for brunch
quite a wait for a table on a sunday
service be okay
good thing -PRON- can say about -PRON- benedict be that the egg be cook right
but nothing special
the potato be cold
not sure if that be because -PRON- plate be wait at the pass or if -PRON- be cook in a gigantic quantity and have be sit for 10 15 minute
on a nice night -PRON- think -PRON- would give morrissey 's another try since -PRON- be such a nice facility and in -PRON- neighborhood(ish
unfortunately -PRON- be a much big disappointment than last time
8:30 on a saturday evening see plenty of parking in the huge parking lot and just a few patron on the large cover patio
walk through the bar to the patio reveal a dozen or so folk engross in -PRON- video poker game and music quietly play in the background
-PRON- be eerily quiet for any bar no irish pub should ever be so quiet
the patio have several huge table and -PRON- select one because the two big comfy couch in front of the fireplace be occupy by three female patron stretch out comfortably watch television
like the rest of the establishment the patio be very nicely do
-PRON- would fairly give this business 4.5 star for the charm and execution of the facility
-PRON- server arrive promptly and -PRON- ask what -PRON- have on tap
bud bud light coors light a miller product maybe guinness harp bass something call sunset wheat and an angry orchard cider
-PRON- ask for the sunset wheat and the wife get the cider
-PRON- also order the night 's special a t bone with veggie and a side for $ 15
as before this be where morrissey 's really let -PRON- down
-PRON- sunset wheat be horrid taste exactly like froot loops the wife put -PRON- finger on the flavor which would not come to -PRON- since -PRON- be be decade since -PRON- have eat froot loops
the cider be quite good but neither of these rating reflect upon morrissey 's except -PRON- presence of mind to include a cider drink and a wheat offering
-PRON- drink less than half -PRON- sunset wheat and that be quite a sacrifice for -PRON-
the t bone steak be quite bad
there be no tenderloin portion at all like -PRON- have be cut away leave only the bone and the new york strip side
the strip side be thin gristly and oddly season
-PRON- have seriously have good steak at ihop or denny 's
good steak mind -PRON-
the flavor of char be overpower as if -PRON- be cook on flame much too high and much too orange leave soot on the meat
the wife take one bite and do not take another though -PRON- love steak
the veggie be mostly squash again oddly seasoned but rise to the level of mediocre or slightly good in taste though disappoint in variety as -PRON- count exactly one ring of red pepper and one floret of broccoli among all the squash
the mash potato make -PRON- angry
-PRON- be very obviously instant potato with an uncooked gritty texture but that would not stop a hungry man from eat -PRON-
what do stop -PRON- be the flavor
-PRON- taste like an ashtray
exactly and overpoweringly like stale cold cigarette ash
not merely a hint of flavor but rather a nose forward unmistakeable strong taste of ash
both of -PRON- gag at -PRON- single small fork full
dunno if -PRON- be intentional direct specifically at -PRON- or just an unhappy accident
-PRON- do not matter to -PRON- why -PRON- happen but -PRON- will never happen to -PRON- again
this be -PRON- second and final trip to morrissey 's
-PRON- be astounded
-PRON- have remain profitable in such a large expensive facility but -PRON- can not last
when -PRON- rent eventually rise -PRON- will fold and someone will purchase a great location and venue
-PRON- will return that day but not before then
-PRON- be always a treat to eat at glutton
-PRON- have the calamarie fries as an app
-PRON- be delicious
nice flaky batter and an eel sauce to die for
dinner be some pasta with smoke chicken that be off the chain
for desert -PRON- have two apple empenada with ice cream so ridiculously good
so all in all just eat here
blimpie be the good franchise sandwich shop around especially this location
the couple that own this store be consistently pleasant and provide wonderful friendly service
if -PRON- be look for a great sandwich without empty -PRON- whole wallet blimpie be a must
-PRON- wish there be more of these around the valley
-PRON- visit this location about 3 time a week and -PRON- be always pleased with the friendless of the teller
-PRON- be quick and efficient never have have be issue
though staff seem friendly -PRON- be not knowledgeable about ship valuable thing how insure a package work and completely overprice
-PRON- use -PRON- service to ship a sewing machine
-PRON- charge $ 25 to put -PRON- in a box and wrap -PRON- with bubble tape
-PRON- be charge $ 136 for postage and insurance though not enough insurance to cover the machine if -PRON- break while ship because -PRON- do not know how
-PRON- feel that -PRON- be pay way too much but be in a time crunch
so -PRON- accept and leave
do not get an actual copy of any shipping form because -PRON- say -PRON- have to keep all copy include the one that say customer copy
once -PRON- package arrive -PRON- feeling of be overcharge be confirm
of the $ 136 -PRON- pay for postage and insurance -PRON- only really cost $ 77 to send
upon contact the owner -PRON- be tell there be no error and the + 75 markup be the retail price because -PRON- have no affiliation with ups and that s how -PRON- earn money to stay in business
have -PRON- take -PRON- package to the us postal service up the street at cave creek
-PRON- would have get good service and pay over $ 50 less for -PRON- shipment
-PRON- would give this store 1 star because of -PRON- experience and feeling that -PRON- be extremely overpriced and shady
-PRON- give -PRON- 2 star however because the item that -PRON- send do arrive in 1 piece and in the amount of time -PRON- be promise
just feel bitter that -PRON- be so severely overcharge for -PRON- service
will not do business here again
would recommend use the usps or the ups store at bell and 32nd
st have not have any issue there before
-PRON- take anyone who come to visit to the fireside lounge and -PRON- always have a blast
-PRON- be a perfectly cheesy wonderland with kick ass bar food and 90 music video gold
two thumb up
terrible customer service
-PRON- be not happy with the salad but the steak be good
after have just a couple bite of the salad -PRON- do not like the dressing at all so -PRON- wait for -PRON- server to check on -PRON- and politely let -PRON- know
-PRON- say -PRON- would take the salad off the bill and just charge for the chicken that come with -PRON-
-PRON- just have a couple bite and mix -PRON- in with the salad
-PRON- tell -PRON- this and -PRON- give a very unprofessional eye roll of doubt
usually this be when -PRON- offer to give -PRON- something else or a manager come to check on -PRON- to see if -PRON- can do anything but no not here
for the rest of the time -PRON- be ignore
the manager would occasionally pass by glance at -PRON- table and shake -PRON- head and mutter something
the server be all group up chat while ignore -PRON-
overall a very frustrating experience and a terribly unprofessional staff
-PRON- be very polite to all of -PRON- and do not deserve that terrible service
very tasty and fresh lebanese style pizza
call ahead -PRON- make -PRON- to order
super friendly family business
the spinach cheese triangle be heavenly and always fresh
-PRON- have no idea what everyone be talk about with this gym and contract and be lie to
-PRON- have no problem when -PRON- sign up
-PRON- be very clear what the option where and what the $ 20 a month get -PRON-
yeah the $ 20 a month be a gimmick -PRON- get people through the door
and then -PRON- sell -PRON- on a good membership
if -PRON- can not figure that one on -PRON- own
sorry
second of all if -PRON- be too lazy to walk -PRON- butt to the gym and ask about membership or change -PRON- membership
-PRON- have a feeling -PRON- be not go to the gym anyway
=)
probably not that dedicated to fitness
so here be the deal with this place the $ 20 membership be crap -PRON- can not do that one because -PRON- can not get -PRON- parking validated that be what the one girl be complain about
-PRON- get the cheap one $ 20 a month and be probably get -PRON- parking validate for awhile before -PRON- figure -PRON- out
the $ 20 a month membership do not include anything except the gym -PRON-
no perk
no free towel no parking no class etc
if -PRON- upgrade and get the $ 35 a month that be what -PRON- pay
-PRON- get unlimited class parking tanning towel service can bring a friend for free every time -PRON- work out etc
all those people complain about parking class etc get the cheap $ 20 membership
-PRON- have a huge movie room that show movie around the clock -PRON- super cool
and -PRON- go every day at 4:15 5:30pm
and -PRON- be not crow at all
however after 5:30pm -PRON- do get busy
yes -PRON- gym have diversity in -PRON- cliental that frequent the place
however -PRON- do not see how that should matter
-PRON- love -PRON- -PRON- bring -PRON- husband on the weekend and -PRON- just watch movie and work out together
-PRON- bring -PRON- girlfriend during the week to work out with -PRON-
-PRON- both get -PRON- parking validate get free towel can tan for free watch movie go to class
-PRON- think for $ 35 a month that be a steal and no -PRON- do not pay a sign up fee but there be an annual fee
the staff have all be nice and -PRON- free training session -PRON- be give go really well too
jeff the trainer teach -PRON- some cool lifts\/mov that -PRON- be still use
the gym be in a great location and when there be event go on in downtown phoenix -PRON- use -PRON- free 3 hour validation from -PRON- gym
-PRON- also belong to la fitness
and -PRON- think gold 's gym be way nice
-PRON- pay $ 25 a month at la fitness
but -PRON- can not ever bring friend for free and no movie room
the only reason why -PRON- still have la be that -PRON- be 1 min from -PRON- house while gold 's be 20 min but be close to -PRON- work
so -PRON- would very much recommend this gym but -PRON- be not offend if -PRON- do not join that way
-PRON- can always find a treadmill when -PRON- watch -PRON- movie ha ha
this place only get 4 star though because no pool and -PRON- be a small gym
-PRON- research each doctor -PRON- go to like crazy
but -PRON- have an emergency this morning where -PRON- wife 's eye for badly scratch by -PRON- infant son
caution to the wind -PRON- need to find anything open on saturday
and -PRON- find salt river be the only place open
what a pleasant surprise to come to yelp after the fact to give a five star review only to find that so many people have already do the same
the staff and doctor be excellent and stay late to see -PRON-
-PRON- will definitely come back here and be so grateful for -PRON- great service

probably the good sushi restaurant -PRON- have ever be to
however not only great for sushi but for japanese cuisine in general
a really cute say place to dine at
all the friendly staff and the nice interior make a visit at kicho to an unforgettable experience
compare drai 's to omnia where -PRON- go -PRON- first night be like night and day
-PRON- be in town for a bachelorette for a friend and be all in -PRON- 30 's
the staff at drai 's be awesome
-PRON- all smile be very friendly and do not have a humongous ego on -PRON- back
the music be amazing and -PRON- dance the night away like -PRON- do at -PRON- wedding three year ago
-PRON- be def

parallax be good
yelp description of 3 start be a ok which be exactly what -PRON- be
good food not great
good atmosphere in one of -PRON- favorite neighborhood in cleveland the tremont district
have only have sushi here so can only speak to that
-PRON- be as good as -PRON- have have in -PRON- many visit to cleveland
give -PRON- a try
the traditional acai bowl be great a little pricy but good
-PRON- be not a fan of -PRON- kid peaunut butter acai bowl
like the atmosphere
-PRON- have have acai bowl at tournament and -PRON- be cheap and -PRON- get a lot more but this place be good for a craving
egg waffle that kick the ass of those place in pacific mall
-PRON- blow away the crap -PRON- get in nyc
thought -PRON- be funny have the token asian make the egg waffle the night -PRON- go
wait be not long for -PRON- -PRON- order four egg waffle cone
probably short because -PRON- be chilly and -PRON- be a weeknight
total wait time be probably from get on line to leave be maybe 20 minute
the ice cream be also delicious
so many interesting flavor
should have try a cookie too
now would -PRON- wait long than 20 minute to get an egg waffle cone
most likely not
-PRON- be not go to wait if the line be a block long
-PRON- line up start at the door to bangbang
if -PRON- want just ice cream or cookie -PRON- should not take as long as the egg waffle which be make to order
go if -PRON- have never be
and if -PRON- have be there skip the egg waffle as -PRON- ice cream be great on -PRON- own or maybe even good with one of -PRON- awesome look cookie
excellent italian food
great wait staff perfect hand make pasta
can not wait to try everything
two hippies have decent food
-PRON- get the chicken burrito which -PRON- find to be tasty
-PRON- love the tortilla that wrap around the burrito
-PRON- also get a side of chip and the green salsa
the chip seem like -PRON- be homemade but -PRON- wish -PRON- have more salt to -PRON-
-PRON- enjoy that the seating be outside and -PRON- be a cozy environment
love the neighborhood feel and location of this restaurant
every dish -PRON- order be outstanding
can not wait to try the grab and go option
i love -PRON- penguin
i love -PRON- fry pickle
-PRON- be one good reason to visit -PRON- hometown
very disappointing for a downtown steakhouse
more of a trendy bay street after work hang out for drink
service be average at good definitely well below other downtown steakhouse
music be loud slant towards r&b and rap not -PRON- thing
again more of a night club atmosphere
very loud
-PRON- have one of the bad beer menu 's in the city
great if -PRON- like canadian or keith 's
why not have a few local craft beer option
all other toronto steakhouse have -PRON-
-PRON- order multiple appetizer for the table
calamari be too bread over fry and the large shrimp be clearly freeze
only standout be the beef slider these be excellent
steak be not the great quality despite the $ 35 $ 50 price tag
a few of the steak bring to -PRON- table be also not cook as request mostly more well do
clearly disappointing for a steakhouse
-PRON- will not be back
too much competition close by for a sub par experience at houston
the keg be significantly good at low price point and if -PRON- want a good high end steak -PRON- will go to jacobs
want to meet people
listen to loud trendy music and have a boring drink

if yes
houston be for -PRON-
bk
amazing time
beautiful view
-PRON- go to las vegas at least once a year
but this be -PRON- first time on the high roller
-PRON- come here at night
there be no line for -PRON- since -PRON- friend be a diamond member
-PRON- get the ticket go through -PRON- brief security check and head upstairs
then -PRON- will put -PRON- in front of a green screen and take -PRON- photo which -PRON- have the option to buy later on after the ride
-PRON- have a bar and restroom before -PRON- head out to the ride
-PRON- can buy -PRON- drink here and get a cute souvernir cup\/bottle for $ 15
the total ride be about 30 minute there be seat inside the ride and -PRON- do share with other people
-PRON- be very comfortable and -PRON- can hardly feel -PRON- move
-PRON- do not make -PRON- feel dizzy
-PRON- be really beautiful at night
there be television inside to show -PRON- how many foot -PRON- be off the ground
-PRON- be really nice to see and be in the ride at least once
-PRON- be a great family outing to visit if -PRON- visit las vegas
once -PRON- be finish with the ride -PRON- can head down and walk around at -PRON- little shopping area
as for the parking -PRON- do valet
the staff be very nice and helpful
no bad service experience here at this business
-PRON- go there for the first time today and order the executive
the avocado and tomato be slice so thin not only could -PRON- not taste -PRON- -PRON- have to check to make sure -PRON- be actually on the sandwich
-PRON- could not be more happy face and happy belly that -PRON- recent favorite lv ayce sushi open a 2nd location in the southwest
-PRON- be so new -PRON- do not even have the official jjanga sign up yet
but that be not stop -PRON- business be already pop off
-PRON- bring -PRON- just as hard as -PRON- og spring mountain location consistently deliver fresh and delicious sushi with top notch service
-PRON- have be twice and the wait time be minimal to non existent
-PRON- be locate adjacent from dw bistro in the same shopping plaza
the steak egg and potato burrito be the bomb
-PRON- have be eat here forever
-PRON- be shocked to not see all five star review
-PRON- would love to buy a franchise if -PRON- franchise
have be there twice the first time the owner be present and service be exceptional
today -PRON- be not present and service be non existent with the exception of the busboy whom -PRON- have to utilize to gain the attention of the server and to even get salt and pepper
the bartender be either talk to each other or on -PRON- phone
the busboy be the hardest work employee there today
for the food do not care for the bread shishito pepper no flavor dip sauce either
ceviche be average but small
meatball and spaghetti squash be excellent however
definitely need more craft beer on tap as well
very disappointing as the hubby
and -PRON- really like -PRON- on the first visit
do like the decor however
highly recommend dr mike
the office staffer be professional knowledgeable and friendly
dr mike be personable
-PRON- sit down as talk to -PRON-
explain everything
-PRON- even suggest option that be be less evasive
a-1 office
-PRON- go here for -PRON- girlfriend 's birthday
-PRON- be a group of 10 and -PRON- be more than happy to take -PRON- reservation when -PRON- call the day of on a saturday
so -PRON- guess if anybody have to make last minute plan on a saturday night and no other restaurant be take reservation -PRON- can call here
:d
the restaurant be dimly light and quiet
-PRON- would say -PRON- be a fine atmosphere for date
either way 3 of -PRON- get the beef burger $ 12 and -PRON- say -PRON- be alright
another friend get elk and -PRON- also hat -PRON-
-PRON- get the grill salmon $ 24.75 -PRON- be creamy and nice but lack flavour
the birthday girl get rib eye steak $ 29 on the autumn menu and -PRON- complain -PRON- be similar to beef that be boil for soup
yeah -PRON- really hat -PRON-
but -PRON- like the yam frite those be really good
other get the pork chop the filet and the chicken malibu
-PRON- do not complain
-PRON- think most of the food can improve a bit with more salt but that be just -PRON-
overall -PRON- feel that the quality of the food be not exactly worth the high price but the price be not high enough to deter -PRON- from buy -PRON-
that make sense right
but the restaurant deserve a 4 because the service be just so top notched and amazing
the owner -PRON- think bring out -PRON- cake sing the happy birthday song with -PRON-
then -PRON- go back to the kitchen to cut the cake and -PRON- bring out -PRON- cake slice decorate with chocolate syrup
-PRON- be touch
umami and -PRON- get off on the wrong foot from the very beginning
-PRON- live just a few door down from this place and have watch the restaurant take shape from the time -PRON- buy -PRON- house renovate -PRON- and open -PRON- door
the willy st. neighborhood be a pretty friendly community
-PRON- be use to live in a mixed use area of commercial and residential building
-PRON- be proud of -PRON- thriving local business and strive to support -PRON-
-PRON- have a long tradition of resident and business work together on this street
but umami have not show -PRON- to be anything approach a local citizen
-PRON- have yet to meet the owner -PRON- receive no forewarning or apologiz for the endless construction traffic impede flow on willy street during -PRON- renovation process
-PRON- receive no invitation to an opening night no neighborly olive branch
as far as -PRON- know umami 's owner be out of towner unfamiliar with madison 's culture and just look to make a buck
as a few other have comment umami 's sign like -PRON- be building be hide and nondescript
most patron do not find -PRON- parking lot meaning that people who actually live on willy st and rely on street parking be start to become accustomed to not be able to find parking in the evening
but all this be local stuff right
for most of -PRON- how umami treat -PRON- 's neighbor be small bean
a month after umami open -PRON- decide to let go of -PRON- resentment and give -PRON- a go
friend from japan be visit from out of town so -PRON- think this would be the perfect opportunity
contrary to what many have say here -PRON- find the service be the highlight of the experience
if anything this place be overstaffed- and the owner have obviously go to great length to maintain asian appearance
-PRON- first shock come when -PRON- walk in the door
the exterior of the building fail completely to capture what the owner be apparently go for
-PRON- be hop for a homey and comfortable noodle joint
walk in -PRON- be blast with a decor scheme that scream chic new york asian fusion
the sparse menu be a disappointing mix of the two
-PRON- get the vegetarian dumpling and -PRON- companion order raman
both be shockingly unremarkable
the high price and try very hard decor try to overshadow the menu 's bland least common denominator approach to japanese food
but the result feel out of touch with madison
where be the taste
where be the fun
where be the palate burst with unexpected flavor combination
at the very least-
where be the careful and delicate ritual and presentation that make japanese food so famous
the menu seem optimize instead for ease and profitability
cool idea behind -PRON-
good flavor ice cream and sorbet
the red velvet macaroon be ok not that tasty but pretty
-PRON- would be nice to add more flavor to the selection
-PRON- have a hide location but -PRON- cool idea and quality drag people here with help of yelp
time to change salon
-PRON- have a teenager who always have free comment about how date -PRON- mom be
-PRON- need
blah
blah
blah
well wendy cut -PRON- hair
and -PRON- come home and -PRON- kid say wow -PRON- look great
need -PRON- say more
what have -PRON- be wait for go there
change -PRON- up in the new year too
-PRON- would hear that tessaro 's have the good burger in pittsburgh and go to check that out
so far -PRON- confirm that reputation
-PRON- have a couple more place to try in the burg but -PRON- will be hard to beat tessaro 's
-PRON- be welcome in a friendly way and show to a table where -PRON- receive great service throughout the meal
the burger be excellent
and be sure to order the home fries amazingly great taste
the guy behind the sushi bar be awesome
food be perfect and the all -PRON- can eat mean all the food on the menu be include in the price
the only thing -PRON- pay for be the drink which -PRON- have special for anyway
definitely will be go back with friend
first off -PRON- usually have -PRON- oil change at pep boys -PRON- have receive a coupon in mail from meineke for $ 14.95
have -PRON- parent drop off -PRON- vehicle in morning and pick up in afternoon
when the pick up the vehicle the charge be $ 27.40
-PRON- pay
when i come home and find out what the bill come to i call and talk with randy -PRON- say the extra charge be the the vehicle take an extra quart
when -PRON- go to pep
boy the coupon be for $ 19.95 and no more
and on top of -PRON- all the recommend item -PRON- find for -PRON- vehicle be to change the radiator coolant that be just do 5 month before
-PRON- do not recommend this company
-PRON- will never have service do here again
super quick super cheap
probably cheap sushi in downtown toronto if not in all of toronto
-PRON- be perfect if -PRON- be at work and look for a quick bite
place be small people normally go here for takeout
awesome frozen yogurt and an adorable decor
-PRON- be in a super nice shopping center and be very refreshing
good frozen yogurt place -PRON- have be to
work injury be devastating
what be bad
not be able to find a therapy clinic to help -PRON- recover that be -PRON- problem before come to performance physical therapy
-PRON- wife and -PRON- struggle to find a clinic that meet -PRON- standard
thank goodness the search be over
joel and danny be by far two of the good physical therapist ever
not only do -PRON- understand -PRON- but -PRON- understand -PRON- body
-PRON- push -PRON- just enough so that -PRON- will help -PRON- recovery
-PRON- be not like the other clinic that push -PRON- past the point where -PRON- can not take the pain
no here everyone want to -PRON- to heal
if -PRON- want -PRON- money 's worth come here
-PRON- have be recommend -PRON- to everyone -PRON- know in search of the perfect pts
give that this place be a reflection if the aria hotel hence -PRON- be name and location
-PRON- be very disappointed
this restaurant do not live up to the standard of the aria let alone good vegas cuisine
service 3.5 star
while sometimes -PRON- waiter take a little longer then -PRON- would have like -PRON- overall be very friendly quiet to take -PRON- order and do well with keep up on the drink etc
atmosphere 4 star
this place look amazing
love the earthy decor if the rock and succulent outside
very beautiful the decorator do an amazing job
also love the leather like booth near the back of the restaurant very comfortable and luxurious
now for the food 2 star at best
lunch here be a disaster
everything be bland and low quality
-PRON- cesar salad must have be one of the most boring salad -PRON- have ever eat
lack flavor and the dressing be rather watery
the nachos be ok something -PRON- could have easily concoct in college with velveeta cheese
the spice to the nachos be good though but -PRON- also could have be starve since -PRON- salad be so blah
breakfast on the other hand be not so bad
dreaded come back here for breakfast after the horrible lunch -PRON- have
but -PRON- be rush and know -PRON- obviously would not have be that busy
-PRON- egg benedict be not bad well cook and the hash brown be a pleasant surprise
still nothing amazing though for the price
-PRON- can not really see this place improve unless -PRON- totally redo the menu and the recipe more likely then not -PRON- will just continue to be open since -PRON- be the hotel main quick cafe restaurant or hopefully a new place all together will come in
-PRON- will see
with so many great place on the strip do not waste a meal let alone two meal at this place
this pristine new hotel offer the good of everything from a friendly front desk to clean comfortable room to a beautiful pool area
stay here with -PRON- wife and daughter in a two room suite and find -PRON- well appoint and very comfortable particularly the king bed
breakfast be just a bit good than -PRON- typical continetal fare however again service be friendly and good than average
centrally locate in the south park area within walk distance to the mall and a plethora of restaurant
-PRON- come for edc weekend and split a room with 5 other people
the room be super clean modern and huge
-PRON- have two queen bed a couch a huge bathroom large space balcony with couch outside for -PRON- to sit on and a little counter with kitchen amenity sink microwave dish washer fridge
-PRON- be able to fit two people per bed one on the couch and one on a blow up mattress -PRON- bring and be able to fit in this large space by the balcony in front of the bed
even with the blow up mattress -PRON- still have a lot of space to walk
so -PRON- can only imagine how big this room be
stay for 5 night and end up pay about $ 390 a person at the end of the stay
not bad for a weekend which usually have high hotel rate
-PRON- stay at caesar last year for edc for the same number of night and pay more for only half the amount of space tiny bathroom and no kitchen area
so -PRON- be definitely more satisfied with -PRON- selection of the cosmopolitan this time around
the cosmo be very conveniently locate in the middle of the strip and right across the street from planet hollywood and walgreens
very useful for when -PRON- need supply
-PRON- do not have a food court inside the cosmo like -PRON- do at caesars for -PRON- to go to whenever -PRON- be hungry but there be a food court in planet hollywood so still nicely locate across the street
cosmo have a lot of restaurant inside though
so if -PRON- do not want quick pick -PRON- up at food court there be definitely plenty of sit down restaurant for -PRON- to try inside the cosmo
-PRON- end up have no space for -PRON- food\/drink in the fridge half the fridge be fill with hotel snack and drink do not touch -PRON- or -PRON- will get charge hefty price
so -PRON- be give an option to either have everything in the fridge that belong to the hotel remove for $ 25 one time charge
not daily charge or be give a brand new fridge for $ 25 one time charge not daily charge
that be pretty awesome
so of course -PRON- order a second fridge
-PRON- balcony be face the non strip view and on the 57th floor
and -PRON- love -PRON-
because after a day of party come back to a nice quiet room with an awesome view be definitely a must
stay on the strip side get quite noisy and when -PRON- finally want to sleep -PRON- will not be able to since -PRON- will hear the continuous late night party from the street
so definitely pick non strip view if -PRON- would like some quiet by the end of -PRON- night
-PRON- be cheap too
there be two swimming pool at the cosmopolitan
the bamboo pool which be small quieter and more for family be locate on the 4th floor of the west end tower where -PRON- stay
-PRON- have two bar there and -PRON- order one of -PRON- specialty drink a berry mojito
really good definitely try that
-PRON- be really strong give -PRON- a good buzz but -PRON- could not taste the alcohol at all
the second pool be call the boulevard pool locate in the east side tower of the cosmo
this pool be more vegas like
face the strip
huge and fancy
with music playing a restaurant beside -PRON- pool table large multi tv screen sit area open glass balcony that look out over the strip and two bar
this be definitely a good pool for young ppl that enjoy the vegas party atmosphere
do not forget -PRON- hotel key because -PRON- need -PRON- to access this pool
do not have time to find the secret 24 hour pizza place inside the cosmo but know that -PRON- exist
and that apparently the pizza be really good

-PRON- order the haddock and chip
the haddock be lightly batter crispy and taste delicious
-PRON- especially like -PRON- chip
the chip be super thick and good
even though -PRON- take out box be cover in oil -PRON- really enjoy fh
this place always get rave review from -PRON- co worker so finally -PRON- go
-PRON- a nice spot and
-PRON- be sure there be some meal good than other but -PRON- be not blow away as -PRON- friend have be describe
-PRON- be good -PRON- be standard
nothing -PRON- of the ordinary
-PRON- do not think -PRON- would go back here when -PRON- know there be good food elsewhere
-PRON- have the sweet and sour chicken crab puff and pot sticker
the app be the good part for -PRON- however -PRON- be still just -PRON- standard app
friend have the chicken lo mein and the orange chicken
both be eh
great customer service
-PRON- have to wait a while for -PRON- dessert
so when -PRON- ask how much longer -PRON- apologize for the wait say -PRON- be on the house which be really nice
then when -PRON- go to pay -PRON- have take the drink off as well for any inconvenience which show -PRON- really care
food be good
macaroon ice cream sandwhich be great
first time try pandan flavor ice cream and highly recommend -PRON-
this place be amazing
-PRON- be rare that -PRON- go somewhere and everything -PRON- put in -PRON- mouth be delicious
-PRON- have be twice and both time -PRON- be amazed at the fast service and the awesome food
first time -PRON- get the filet which be to die for
loaded bake potato be on point
salad be fresh and even the croissant be devine cook with just a little sugar on top
yum
waitress be sweet and keep -PRON- drink full
second trip the waitress suggest rib
excellent choice -PRON- fall off the bone and the glaze carrot be just like -PRON- mom
highly recommend this place for a date night or just for an awesome meal
both time texas road house have a 45 min wait while this place have immediate seating
sure -PRON- be pricy
but -PRON- truly do get what -PRON- pay for
-PRON- would go back again in a heartbeat
if -PRON- hungry this be not the place to eat
when -PRON- go the food take forever
-PRON- understand -PRON- make to order but geeez forever
-PRON- order a chicken sandwich something and -PRON- be nothing special coffee be cold twice -PRON- ask for hot coffee until finally -PRON- bring the mouth burn coffee out lol
-PRON- will skip this place in the future
oh the calamari salad be ok
the display of sweet at this bakery be incredible
-PRON- be almost impossible to choose
so much so that -PRON- buy 6 thing and bring -PRON- home to share
everything be incredible but -PRON- favorite be the chocolate cream cheese danish
horrible customer service
-PRON- mess up -PRON- order and treat -PRON- like -PRON- do not care
no wonder -PRON- never see more than one table be use at a time
-PRON- advice to -PRON- be to avoid this place like the plague
bad pizza experience of -PRON- life
and -PRON- be willing to put up with a lot for good food
this place be a small joint
all -PRON- noodle be hand make to order
-PRON- come here to celebrate a belat birthday with a friend of -PRON-
-PRON- be around 7 p.m. when -PRON- get there
and -PRON- be pack
there be no table for 3 so -PRON- wait around 10 min or so for a table
-PRON- be check out -PRON- menu while wait and -PRON- love -PRON- menu design
-PRON- menu be like a food drink magazine spread
-PRON- menu 1
knifed sliced noodles with braised pork
the noodle be make and cook right in front of -PRON-
the noodle have a chewy texture which be quite nice
the braise pork be so so
the noodle really absorb the broth so -PRON- really have to eat quick or ask for more broth next time
2 sizzle tofu
-PRON- be fry tofu square marinate in a ma pao tofu sauce
a ting of spice -PRON- be quite yummy
3
hand pull special house noodles noodles have a nice texture meat and egg be a bit over do
4
hand pull spicy pork intestines
-PRON- enjoy -PRON- the most
the noodle texture be excellent nice chewiness and texture
the broth be to -PRON- liking of spice level
but there be not enough intestine in -PRON- opinion
overall the place be a great place to eat with the add bonus of the noodle make on the spot
-PRON- subtract a star because the water jug be kind of murky
bring -PRON- daughter here to try -PRON- menu
-PRON- start with the silder which be delicious and then share the hanger steak
-PRON- be cook perfect but not a big fan of the corn the potato where awesome
then -PRON- have the s'mor brownie yum
spot on
both of -PRON- leave happy and full
old school with a mix of regular and newbs
very relaxing atmosphere
the burger be off the chain
each one be cook with burgundy wine to order hence the name
try the wineburger with jalapeno
lot of flat screen to watch whichev sporting event
-PRON- be interested in
just ask and -PRON- will find -PRON-
drink be well price and serve quickly
the true star of this place be the staff
funny quirky and quick with a drink
able to talk to and become buddy with anyone that walk through the door
mel and mark keep -PRON- laugh feed and with fresh drink every time -PRON- stop in
this be not a hipster place -PRON- may say wine in the name but this a be a bar that serve great bar food
and if -PRON- be a hipster no worry -PRON- will be accept and treat like an old friend
excellent taco and burrito
try -PRON- and -PRON- will fall in love with this place
this place be so good
different flavor everyday
-PRON- can sample all the flavor
love how friendly the owner be
yummmy
the room of this hotel be well below par however the staff be super friendly and -PRON- have shuttle service to the strip
-PRON- be not the good place to host a meeting but overall a pretty good experience for business travel
if -PRON- come on leisure to vegas though -PRON- would stay closer or on the strip
-PRON- would steer clear of this place
the staff be friendly and nice
but as far as treat -PRON- pet this place be incompetent
-PRON- take -PRON- pet 11 yr old dog in about 8 month ago
-PRON- be tell -PRON- have pneumonia bronchitis
-PRON- give -PRON- med for treatment
-PRON- never inform -PRON- that 2 week later there be a check up
so -PRON- get a call and email to bring gracie back in for a check up
-PRON- do this immediately
-PRON- be charge again for a follow up and more med because -PRON- claim the one that be prescribe the first time be not strong enough to treat -PRON- illness
after pay for all of this again -PRON- dog have never get better
but -PRON- be out a $ 1000 and -PRON- be suffer
-PRON- do not have anymore money to take -PRON- to a real vet and these bloodsucker do not care that -PRON- beloved pet be home suffering and can not breathe
-PRON- just want billable patient and could care less about diagnose and treatment
beware
this be the bad hooter restaurant -PRON- ever be
-PRON- chicken wing be dry and the french fry suck
-PRON- though -PRON- should be the good since -PRON- be locate at -PRON- own hotel
but -PRON- guess -PRON- assumption be wrong
btw
the girl at s.fl be much good than there
-PRON- have an appointment with julia -PRON- hygienist on monday august 28 2017
prior to -PRON- appointment -PRON- lose a filling in -PRON- upper left front incisor so -PRON- be not very attractive to smile
dr. marrandino be able to see -PRON- before -PRON- appointment with julia
-PRON- do not expect -PRON- to do anything that day and be sure -PRON- would need a crown
to -PRON- surprise -PRON- fill -PRON- and do not recommend a crown at this time
-PRON- look great
-PRON- see julia after that and leave the office feeling terrific
dr. marrandino have be -PRON- dentist for 30 year and -PRON- be an amazing lady do great work and take good care of -PRON- patient
excellent show while -PRON- enjoy a pretty fair pizza
-PRON- do not necessarily come here for great food but the entertainment be top shelf
what a colossal organ with literally all the bell whistle and anything mechanical that can make a musical sound
do not miss the big show
carlos and -PRON- partner santos be two of the most professional friendly people around and -PRON- team do an excellent job
-PRON- always ask for feedback on -PRON- job to make sure -PRON- be to -PRON- standard and be license bond and insure so -PRON- can have a peace of mind know that -PRON- be professional and -PRON- be in good hand
-PRON- be from philadelphia in the states and -PRON- literally take trip to toronto for this place
-PRON- want gallon of the vegetarian gravy because -PRON- be seriously the good stuff
the staff be always so sweet and the poutine be always bangin
-PRON- will always make a stop here every time -PRON- visit the city
in a word loud
-PRON- be so loud at cph that -PRON- be hard to concentrate
the food be not memorable and -PRON- husband and -PRON- could not even talk to each other without shout to be hear
the hostess could not hear -PRON- when -PRON- check in for -PRON- reservation and have to walk into the hallway to hear -PRON-
-PRON- server could not hear -PRON- well when -PRON- order
and what should have be a 5 minute wait turn into a 25 minute wait
why bother make a reservation
-PRON- have bernie 's mac and cheese
-PRON- be just ok
husband have the meatloaf that too be just ok
dining out be a full experience though
-PRON- be not just about the food
-PRON- be about the service and ambiance too
the service be just alright but again -PRON- be so frickin loud that the ambiance be totally ruin and -PRON- think that also effect the service because there be an air of disinter in the service staff and hostess that be palatable
-PRON- get that -PRON- be a pub
that say -PRON- can not charge what cph charge for food and expect people to have to shout at each other during the experience
-PRON- will not be back
-PRON- be not worth -PRON-
-PRON- truly do not get the hype at all
yesterday be -PRON- second outing to this eastern outpost of brunch
-PRON- be as good as the first time
-PRON- have the heuvos migas which be a score
there be a lineup
but -PRON- be down with that
truly a hubbub inside as -PRON- take -PRON- seat and marvel at the quick and efficient service
oh my where to start
ok start with the dosas
incredible vegetarian food -PRON- may yet convert to the green side
atmosphere be bowl alley but who be look when -PRON- have such delicacy on -PRON- plate
do -PRON- mention the dosas
bring -PRON- appetite and earplug if -PRON- be a busy day
so amazing
this place be a must see
-PRON- perfectly preserve past and modern show girl history
from costume to matchbook this place have so much history and love
-PRON- can literally feel like -PRON- have step in a time machine
-PRON- visit this bike shop about a year ago to look into buy a trail bike
the shop be busy but the owner be quick to say hello and say -PRON- would be right with -PRON- as soon as -PRON- finish with -PRON- current customer
once -PRON- get start -PRON- explain what kind of rid -PRON- want to do and -PRON- price range and -PRON- be very helpful in recommend some bike
-PRON- also let -PRON- take one for a spin on the greenway which be a really nice gesture
-PRON- end up go with a different bike that be not available at uptown cycles
but -PRON- return just a few day ago to have two bike box up for shipping
again -PRON- receive excellent polite service at a reasonable price
-PRON- even allow -PRON- friend to pick up -PRON- boxed bike without -PRON- as -PRON- be scramble through errand for a big move
-PRON- would strongly recommend -PRON- give this bike shop a try -PRON- be top notch
fun show great look entertainer

-PRON- go on a thursday night and -PRON- be fantastic
-PRON- do book this property via travelocity
the receptionist in the front be nice very helpful as -PRON- do tell -PRON- that there be a $ 50 deposit

-PRON- be a bit hesitant about leave -PRON- vehicle alone

-PRON- do see people sleep in the hallway where there use to be an ice vend machine
upon enter -PRON- room the first thing that -PRON- notice be the smell -PRON- be a combination of cigarette this stale odor
then -PRON- notice roach run around
at this point -PRON- want to leave or switch room
but -PRON- be already to late to do so -PRON- be sure all the room where like this
with know about the roach -PRON- leave -PRON- luggage in car
and only bring in what -PRON- need
-PRON- do not want any critter hitchhike
anywho the little bag -PRON- do bring in -PRON- hang up on the hanger
-PRON- keep the ac light on all night -PRON- do not want to see any roach
the room have a king size bed dresser and old school tv four lamp only one work and some retro appliance mini fridge and two microwave

but everything work
there be a coffee maker in the restroom but -PRON- pass on that
the shower nice
but the rail in tub come off when -PRON- grab -PRON- for support

-PRON- think -PRON- the wifi name be daysinn
which be pretty decent speed
the nightlife in the motel be something too
-PRON- hear people argue in the hallway around 1 a.m.
door slam
if -PRON- on a budget this place be for -PRON-
do -PRON- do -PRON- purpose
yes
-PRON- be able to sleep shower
-PRON- know when -PRON- have those day where -PRON- think diet
what diet

yeah those be the day that -PRON- go to the cornish pasty company
because what be a pasty if not a bread pocket stuff with all the world 's delight and 1,000 calorie
well maybe not 1,000 calorie but
-PRON- be close-
-PRON- be also worth -PRON-
prior to abandon meat -PRON- favorite be the royale with cheese minus the shroom please
-PRON- favorite food in the entire world use to be a round patty of ground beef sandwich between two sesame seed bun until -PRON- discover this little treasure
a pocket stuff with ground beef cheese grill onion and get this french fry
-PRON- honestly do not get any good than this
that be of course until -PRON- become a vegetarian
now -PRON- favorite guilty pleasure have become the cheese and onion pasty
pack with potato rutabega cheese and onion and lot of ketchup on the size
even though -PRON- know all the sodium will because -PRON- to bloat up like a blimp later -PRON- just can not resist eat -PRON- all in one sit
there be a robust vegetarian menu feature quorn brand mock meat which have be delicious each time -PRON- have try -PRON-
and every now and then when -PRON- be determined to stay on the old diet wagon but everyone in -PRON- lunch meeting want pasty fear not -PRON- do have a salad menu
the pasta salad be super yummy and come with the option of add meat if -PRON- be look for some additional protein
bottom line there really be something for everyone at the cornish pasty co.
if -PRON- have not try -PRON- yet do -PRON-
first time experience korean food and -PRON- be very tasty
-PRON- have a wonderful soup with short rib green onion and other veggie and egg
the broth be mild
-PRON- can not recall the name of -PRON-
the small side dish be amazing and be include in -PRON- meal
a word of caution for anyone look for a typical americanized chinese menu
this be not the place
korean food be different from other asian fare
-PRON- be hearty and spicy
though -PRON- do not have to be
-PRON- use egg and beef liberally plus garlic and chili
-PRON- be delicious but not -PRON- typical asian cuisine that most americans be use to
if -PRON- be an adventurous eater or want to broaden -PRON- culinary horizon -PRON- highly suggest a trip to this charming hole in the wall

top service from start to finish
stop in on a monday night glad to see -PRON- be open because a lot of place close on mondays
the place be pack at 630pm which be a good sign

15 minute later -PRON- be seat at a 4 top even tho -PRON- be alone
-PRON- say -PRON- would happily wait for a 2 top
but -PRON- say -PRON- have wait long enough and that be that
order seaweed salad agedashi tofu assort sashimi and hot sake
everything be great
but -PRON- wish the tofu have be cut in small piece which would make -PRON- easy to eat but still very nice
not a fan of white tuna
-PRON- actually escolar which can negatively affect some people when eat raw
-PRON- just pass on -PRON-
love -PRON- when cook through like at miga
all in all a great meal
but the real plus be be look after by sophia a very helpful and attentive employee that always have a smile on -PRON- face and be very welcoming
bravo to -PRON- -PRON- will no doubt find great success in life with that kind of attitude and work ethic

-PRON- strongly recommend this experience
do the birthday party in fast forward with -PRON- daughter
-PRON- have a lot of friend come -PRON- have a great time -PRON- be very accommodate
-PRON- would give -PRON- five star except -PRON- think the place need some update and the floor for skating be not as nice as -PRON- have see elsewhere
other than that the place be fabulous the staff be wonderful and -PRON- daughter 's birthday party be a big hit
greg and sharon be one of the most talented friendly creative and dynamic team -PRON- have ever work with
-PRON- work together on a big photo shoot in los angeles and -PRON- be one of the good experience -PRON- have ever have with modeling
-PRON- enthusiasm and energy be contagious so be prepared to have a lot of fun
-PRON- can not wait for -PRON- next opportunity to work with -PRON-
pizza be not fresh at all
everything on the buffet be stale and cold
no fresh pizza bring out during -PRON- visit
ask for a refund and leave
super poor service go in all the time with -PRON- son and just get bad and bad each time
this last time(which be -PRON- last time go to this location take about 15 plus minute to even reach -PRON- table when there be only 2 server in the whole place and hardly any table sit
no one be help eachother just stand around
never come again
do not recommend at all
a belly dancer in indian restaurant
this place be insult to indian cousin
-PRON- can not emphasis enough how terrible food be
-PRON- need several furniture item assemble
john do a fantastic job
-PRON- be on time and be very friendly and professional
-PRON- recommend john 100
nyki be really amazing at spray tanning
-PRON- do -PRON- airbrush for -PRON-
-PRON- be all about love and kindness and good energy at purple sunrise
-PRON- a really nice place
good service and wonderful people
-PRON- family and -PRON- decide to stop by and try this place out
-PRON- daughter get a bean burrito and -PRON- husband and -PRON- get the pork carnita taco
the food be good
the service be fast and friendly
-PRON- would definitely go back
this dog bar be by far one of the good nearby
not only be -PRON- super clean but also have staff member on hand to make sure everyone be safe especially consider not all dog owner be super responsible
the weighted\/magnetic door be an amazing thing for keep the dog safe as well
staff be super friendly and attentive
this place be huge as well and offer amazing special
parking be great too
definitely find -PRON- new place as much as -PRON- love the other dog bar
mediocre at good
-PRON- go with -PRON- boyfriend a couple of month ago
-PRON- order the vegetarian combo -PRON- do not remember what -PRON- have
-PRON- be both huge fan of pakistani food but -PRON- be both very dissapointed and feel this restaurant do not hold up to the hype
as someone who regularly eat authentic indian and pakistani food twice to three time a week
-PRON- think the food be way too greasy and give -PRON- huge stomach ache
same thing happen with -PRON- pakistani friend who go here as well as a lot of people at -PRON- work
-PRON- both feel -PRON- be not worth the price and -PRON- be not come back
-PRON- have look far and wide for a poutine place in the states that can compare to what smoke 's put out and sadly -PRON- have yet to find one
-PRON- be sure quebecians will judge smoke 's more harshly as -PRON- should but for a poutine deprived soul such as -PRON- smoke 's be a godsend
-PRON- think the big weakness in american poutine would be the cheese curd
there be really no substitute for those soft and gooey curd
the chicken peppercorn be what -PRON- order and for the life of -PRON- there be not a thing -PRON- would change about -PRON-
word to the wise though eat as much as -PRON- can fresh
leftover poutine should only be a last resort drunk food
this be actually the first time -PRON- have ever hire mover
but -PRON- have be teach from a young age that all mover be out to ruin -PRON- life
fortunately -PRON- can say that -PRON- move -PRON- actually make -PRON- life a lot better
-PRON- wife son and -PRON- be move 30 minute across town and -PRON- have about 2100 sq
ft of space 6 room fill with heavy furniture and two flight of stair to get -PRON- all out
-PRON- call 4 5 local move company and each of -PRON- tell -PRON- over the phone that -PRON- would need 4 guy at anywhere between 160 220\/hr
one company even tell -PRON- -PRON- would need two truck
curti with -PRON- move -PRON- be the only one who insist on see the unit before give -PRON- an estimate and because -PRON- do -PRON- be able to get -PRON- rate down to just 3 guy at 125\/hr
-PRON- lock in a move date before -PRON- even leave the house
-PRON- call curtis the week of the move to confirm and -PRON- receive an additional confirmation call the day before
the mover show up right on time and just as promise -PRON- come with two starbucks beverage custom order that -PRON- sip whilst stand around watch -PRON- move -PRON- stuff
-PRON- have kimi darius and will pack up -PRON- entire place in 3:30 hour and the truck be pack so well
-PRON- probably could have fit -PRON- car in the back
-PRON- be incredibly impressed with how securely -PRON- wrap -PRON- couch table etc
and how there be no way anything be go to be damage during the move
-PRON- also can not say enough how courteous everybody be throughout the entire process
-PRON- be happy to buy -PRON- lunch and give -PRON- a break halfway through
the unload process seem to go even quicker and the guy insist on make sure all of -PRON- stuff end up in the right room
-PRON- be do shortly after 3 p.m. and -PRON- bill be round down to the near 15 minute
-PRON- be surprised at how accurate the price be compare to -PRON- original estimate and even more surprised that -PRON- come out to be $ 50 less
-PRON- take credit card which be important so that -PRON- could get airline mile and also because have a cashier 's check on hand be probably the last thing on -PRON- mind that day
base on yelp
-PRON- be sure a number of company would have do the job well and possibly at a similar rate but -PRON- move -PRON- go above and beyond in all category
reliable and very tasty basic pizza
where most corner place try to hide a flavourless bread like thick dough with excessive amount of dubious topping fresca keep -PRON- straight with a thin crust and basic topping for when -PRON- want a good bite
-PRON- garlic basil oil which go on the margherita pack a lot of flavour and keep -PRON- come back to -PRON- as -PRON- go to weekend slice
the last t shirt -PRON- see on the owner tell -PRON- about the no fuss service do -PRON- look like -PRON- be a people person
but that do not detract from the most important thing which be -PRON- food
although -PRON- work as -PRON- pizza after heavy drinking option unlike most other place in the neighbourhood -PRON- also work when -PRON- be completely sober and can actually tell good from bad
this be -PRON- favorite mexican food chain
the grande taco salad -PRON- great
with a side of ranch of course
but -PRON- the people that work there -PRON- have some really good server
in fact alot of -PRON- move up and out sadly
this specific location have a bumpy start with -PRON- and work really hard to to fix -PRON- and over the last year have just be wonderful
call ahead for group of 18
tell by gentleman to come on down
the manager come over and tell -PRON- -PRON- could not seat -PRON-
very unfriendly and rude
if -PRON- be not for the location this place would be close
bad attitude
chain or not and because if -PRON- be like -PRON- -PRON- have never really run into one of these before -PRON- have to post about jimmy j 's
awesome sandwich good than subway and quizno be as far as the chain go as far as -PRON- be concerned serve super fresh and super fast
-PRON- know -PRON- sound like a commercial or something but this place be really awesome
and -PRON- be not sacrifice cheapness for the quality and speed -PRON- be very reasonable for the sandwich
-PRON- always get -PRON- sandwich usually turkey or roast beef on the wheat bread which be fresh and amazing but -PRON- can get -PRON- on sourdough\/french too
-PRON- always add pepper and oil and vinegar but that be just -PRON-
-PRON- really can not go wrong
and like -PRON- say -PRON- be sooo fast and -PRON- always get -PRON- order right
as have be mention elsewhere -PRON- have ton of option a huge staff for such a small in and out store no seating so -PRON- be always an easy experience
if -PRON- go during the lunch crush though -PRON- will get just that a crunch
ton of people descend on this one but the crowd be always handle incredibly efficiently
wow -PRON- just talk a lot about a sandwich place

at first -PRON- be hesitant because -PRON- be expensive but after see -PRON- daughter enjoy -PRON- so much -PRON- be definitely worth the 85.00 a month
-PRON- love gordon ramsay and -PRON- love the food here
-PRON- do the hells kitchen sampler
-PRON- be pricey but worth -PRON-
-PRON- be quite an experience
the restaurant ambiance be really great and the service impeccable
-PRON- favorite all time restaurant
-PRON- be from louisiana originally and
-PRON- wife and -PRON- have be search for a restaurant that use season
-PRON- find -PRON- right by -PRON- house on accident
-PRON- read the review here and be sceptical but give -PRON- a try
omg be -PRON- glad -PRON- do -outstand burger love the spinach dip appetizer pork chop be great
must try
not sure about the other review but to call the menu regular bar food be inaccurate imo
great service eclectic menu with amazing burger
-PRON- go every week now
-PRON- live upstairs and both be in the service industry sometimes boyfriend
and -PRON- do not get to eat dinner until 10 p.m.
-PRON- usually hit pub at gateway when be starve and tired
-PRON- be just a little hole in the wall
the menu be pretty large though and -PRON- have a good beer selection
some thing be good than other but the portion be generally huge
what make this place great be the service
no matter what time -PRON- be or how many people be at the bar -PRON- have always have great and friendly service
ace be one the good neighborhood bar -PRON- have ever frequent
the only thing -PRON- could compare -PRON- to if -PRON- have to would be cheer great food great people and 24\/7

occupy the location formerly know as pho vietnam grille express off of durango behind arby 's there be plenty to like on -PRON- menu
always opt for sweet option -PRON- son and -PRON- split the churro waffle and nutella s'mor
french toast
the former could have use more cinnamon and sugar but be still a delicious waffle with a light and crispy texture and top with a generous scoop of vanilla ice cream
the nutella s'mor french toast be pure sweetness overload
three thick slice of egg soak bread be coat in graham cracker with layer of nutella and marshmallow between each
-PRON- be so overwhelming that -PRON- could only finish a little more than half
a good concept well execute dish and huge portion have turn -PRON- into a fan and most likely a repeat customer
-PRON- come here with a big group of friend while visit the burgh for a buddy 's wedding
there be 10 of -PRON- in -PRON- party and -PRON- visit on restaurant week
-PRON- will start with the good the view here be amazing
definitely make a trip to the top of Mount washington if -PRON- be from out of town
do not visit this restaurant though the view be the only thing give -PRON- a second star
the food be mediocre
nothing be offensive but nothing be worth the $ 35 price of entry either
-PRON- can not imagine pay the regular price for -PRON-
-PRON- gf and -PRON- both have a salmon dish that be just very meh
everyone else at the table seem to feel similarly about -PRON- food
what make -PRON- bad be the service
-PRON- be unable to split check pour the wrong wine in to glass mix -PRON- and be just generally rude and unaccommodating
start with the specialty cocktail and end with a fois gra dessert this be truly an exceptional dining experience
the lamb loin melt in -PRON- mouth
-PRON- can tell the chef have a true passion for -PRON- job and put forth that extra effort to exceed expectation
really great and different combination of flavor not the standard fare
one of -PRON- top five dining experience ever and -PRON- be old
ok -PRON- officially a problem -PRON- be in love with astor house
the chicken the turkey the collard and the coleslaw omg -PRON- a problem
officially
this be a great restaurant to dine or hang out when in vegas
the menu offer a variety of more of the american spanish fusion tapas rather than traditional spanish tapas
-PRON- order 5\/5 camarones a la diabla shrimp with firely sweet and spicy sauce $ 10
5\/5 grill scallops $ 12
4.5\/5 steamed mussel $ 9.50
3\/5 seafood paella $ 20 45 min
wait so order in advance
5\/5 large salad $ 12
the shrimp and scallop be absolutely flavorful and cook to perfection
even the salad with sun dry tomato and roast pepper be absolutely delicious
since this be a spanish tapas restaurant -PRON- decide to try -PRON- seafood paella
the paella take 45 minute to prepare and for most people that be not a long wait since the time go by fairly quickly when people be talk and sample tapa
nevertheless -PRON- be not very authentic so will skip that next time around
great service and lively atmosphere
will definitely return
-PRON- just buy a bike here after test rid a whole bunch of different type and the team here be really fantastic at pull different option down for -PRON- to ride match -PRON- up with something -PRON- think would work well base on what -PRON- have explain to -PRON- and even bring down a few outside the box option which -PRON- have not even pick out -PRON- even though at first -PRON- be like oh no way
and then end up buy that very bike
-PRON- be so helpful friendly knowledgeable really really nice and easy to work with
-PRON- do not feel like -PRON- be be sell and -PRON- be respectful of -PRON- price point
-PRON- need to stay in
big big shout out 's to the ultra helpful cort brian and the gentleman with the slight accent wear the cinelli hat in the back who tune up -PRON- bike
these guy be so helpful really awesome to work with and -PRON- would recommend this bike shop for purchase tune up or just someone to shoot the breeze with adn talk about bike trail
thank guy
great company shane be fair honest hand on
-PRON- would highly recommend -PRON- -PRON- company to every one thx cb
usually quite good but last time the service be slow and the food be not as great
other time the food be very good wonderful atmosphere and good service
-PRON- truely pain -PRON- to have to write this as -PRON- family have be go here for over 20 year but -PRON- guess all good thing come to an end
if -PRON- would have ask -PRON- 15 year ago -PRON- would have say -PRON- food be the good in town
today -PRON- be mediocre
at best
and -PRON- find two hair in -PRON- food- one a grey hair about 2 inch long
the other about an inch long
and -PRON- could not determine the color
-PRON- have let -PRON- food quality slip quite a lot which in phoenix arizona be pretty sad to find sub par mexican food
the competition for mexican food here be fierce because of how many restaurant there be and even though -PRON- hate to do so -PRON- will be go to one of a million other mexican food restaurant from now on
-PRON- would think that the insane amount of competition would encourage -PRON- to up -PRON- game instead of let -PRON- go down the drain
-PRON- feel that unless -PRON- take some pride in -PRON- food -PRON- generic date menu and very bland food will drive -PRON- door shut
so this place and the cheese cake factory come from the same company
seriously what be the difference
all the fine in corporate mediocrity
-PRON- claim such great service but -PRON- be untrue
-PRON- drop off 18 case of pergo floor at a wrong address without get a signature
when -PRON- call and leave a message for the owner of the company -PRON- never reply
-PRON- would never use -PRON- on -PRON- own but unfortunately the company that be send -PRON- product do
-PRON- just get a second delivery and 3 of the 8 box of floor be damage
-PRON- really wish -PRON- could give minus star to show how well -PRON- think -PRON- do
-PRON- be go with a ok for -PRON- first visit to green mango
-PRON- show up during off hour 3 p.m. on a saturday and be initially lure in by the neon sign say good pho
that work for -PRON- -PRON- be cold and damp outside and -PRON- want that oh familiar warmth in -PRON- belly stat
then as -PRON- sit in the very nicely put together restaurant review the menu and the yelp review concurrently -PRON- decide that $ 10 for noodle soup be not worth -PRON- unless -PRON- be a massive bowl
-PRON- go with -PRON- go to thai meal in the end street style pad thai
-PRON- have several option for this dish include chicken beef shrimp or a mix of any of the three
-PRON- go with a shrimp and beef mix
-PRON- also ask for -PRON- to make -PRON- thai spicy
result a fair mild tasting pad thai with only 2 shrimp and some some beef
-PRON- provide extra spice on the side to help kick -PRON- up a few notch but -PRON- do not make a difference
maybe -PRON- be -PRON- taste bud but -PRON- be not spicy
overall -PRON- be tasty just not the good -PRON- have have
but still good
eatcrest out
bad place ever
manager be rude and uninformed
if an item be miss a price -PRON- refuse sell -PRON- rather than price -PRON-
be go to buy a bike that have be here for month
-PRON- be miss price tag ask for manager -PRON- be a complete rude jerk
tell -PRON- -PRON- would have to come back tomorrow
furthermore not only do this place have sky high price in item that be give to -PRON- for free
most people be unaware that this place do not give a dime to any charity
-PRON- be for profit and have lie and deceive the public with -PRON- name
take -PRON- money elsewhere this place be a disgrace
-PRON- gouge the people in this community and the staff be rude and flat out uneducated
shop at saint vincent or give money to charity -PRON-
avoid this place
bad management -PRON- have ever see
horrible experience
super overprice -PRON- acquire via generosity
place like this should be shut down and not permit to operate under such deceptive tactic
10 17 17
visit this place only once and enter because there be live music
there be two start band play -PRON- own repertoire
the place have a sort of grungy hangout feel to -PRON-
the audience be friendly and enjoy -PRON- by just listen to the music
anyhow if -PRON- look for a nice midweek after dinner beer while bounce -PRON- head to some live poprock this be the place
-PRON- will definitely return
the show be a lot of fun but not as fun as -PRON- be hype up to be by many of -PRON- friend
-PRON- hate -PRON- when that happen
-PRON- be really expect a whole lot more energy from this group
-PRON- think -PRON- have see way too many promo of dance blue man shoot liquid out of -PRON- pvc pipe musical instrument all at high energy rgb action
there be one section of the show where the blue men bm canvass the audience to look for a volunteer to do a bit with -PRON- on stage
this be entirely too draw out
sit in the balcony make -PRON- more difficult to see what -PRON- be do -PRON- seem like -PRON- drag out for 20 or so minute before -PRON- find someone
once on stage -PRON- be a silent physical comedy bit that be funny at first but get way too long
-PRON- start to feel that $ 50 ticket stub start to burn a hole in -PRON- pocket
overall -PRON- be a decent show definitely good for kid
have -PRON- water heater replace today in less then 1 hour
paul provide a new 50 gallon electric water heater with new hose and valve
take the old water heater all for a very reasonable price of less then $ 550
water heater be up and run now and look great
highly recommend -PRON- service
to be fair this business and -PRON- mustard deserve a high rating than average but for one specific reason -PRON- need to be fair in review -PRON-
there be a time when kozlik 's be difficult to find outside -PRON- stand which become a booth which have almost become a store at st. lawrence market
gradually -PRON- mustard have become available around the province
-PRON- be happy for -PRON- business
if one look at the list of what go into -PRON- mustard on the bottle one notice that mustard be the first list which mean -PRON- be the high volume ingredient
compare that to crappy heinz or french 's yike
heinz and french 's begin with vinegar then water then dye then more dye then
-PRON- be sure there be some mustard in there somewhere
-PRON- get the picture
in the meanwhile kozlik 's have add to -PRON- line up and have twenty odd bottle
the problem after so many year in the business kozlik be still do not get hot or spicy
this be inattentive and odd for a business that focus on mustard and only mustard
one can try hot or very hot or xxx or whatev and this.business.does.not.have.a.mustard
honestly the owner must just hate spicy or hot mustard
one figure amidst a line up of twenty one would actually be hot
nope
-PRON- be not even one of those people who be obsess with really hot or suicide flavour
-PRON- just sometimes want a little hotness
these guy do not provide -PRON-
-PRON- be cost -PRON- a whole segment of the market presumably
-PRON- advice to kozlik 's be to pick up a hot mustard off the supermarket shelf and compare to -PRON- xxx or very hot
-PRON- be such an obvious omission
-PRON- price have go up by $ 1 and be now $ 6
buy four and the price be $ 5 each
-PRON- do not recommend buy more than one at a time because old mustard lose -PRON- potency
only buy multiple if -PRON- be to go to different household
as always the kozlik 's people be friendly and have sample out for all to taste
good idea
the food be generally ok
large portion
the staff could lose the attitude already
so over that
-PRON- be absolutely amazing to -PRON- that people be not feel this colossal wonder -PRON- perfect- recline seat with huge cushioning ample leg room full bar classic\/indie film screening online ticketing advanced seat selection for all movie etc
yeah
the ticket be $ 14 dollar
if -PRON- want something cheap this be not -PRON- theater
go to the old moldy dingy theater
stop rag on these guy
-PRON- do not sell out
-PRON- be not do a disservice to -PRON- loyal customer
heck -PRON- be one of those customer and have be for year now own multiple free popcorn shirt
these homie step up -PRON- game with this miraculous monument to cinema
-PRON- a celebration to film go to a movie be a luxury and an escape
treat -PRON- to the experience
enjoy the recline seat and the extra leg room
-PRON- be very disappointed to learn that luxottica the big eye ware company on earth own target and sears optical -PRON- also own all the frame in -PRON- store ray ban oakley
last year luxottica make over 77 million pair of sunglass and optical frame
-PRON- do not make prescription lens
-PRON- also own sunglass hut the large sunglass chain in the world pearl vision centers lens crafters the large eye wear retail chain in north america
the average cost of frame and lens at lens crafters be about $ 300).luxottica make glass for prada burberry ralph lauren bvlgari tiffany dolce gabana channal etc
-PRON- price be outrageous
luxottica frame purchase at a luxoticca retailer be still charge at full msrp
want to have -PRON- product offer in a luxottica own store
good luck
-PRON- be a monopoly offer an illusion of choice to uninformed consumer
at one time oakley get into a dispute about pricing with luxottica so luxottica drop -PRON- from -PRON- store
oakley 's stock immediately drop and then luxottica buy -PRON- out
big competitor be wal mart and cost co. luxottica can set price and there be nothing -PRON- can do about -PRON- other than not buy -PRON-
luxottica also own the nation 's second large insurance vision care plan eyemed
-PRON- glass cost $ 600+tax at target and -PRON- have to pay the optometrist an additional $ 60 for the eye exam
the optometrist do not work for target or luxottica
as for the quality of the glass -PRON- have to send the lens back 3 time before -PRON- could see clearly out of each eye with the glass on
the employee do not seem to care that -PRON- vision be bad with the glass on
-PRON- suggest -PRON- just wear -PRON- and get use to -PRON-
-PRON- argue that the whole point of get glass be so -PRON- can see clearly out of both eye at the same time not one eye blurry and one eye clear and be tell to get use -PRON- for $ 660
by -PRON- third visit -PRON- get the prescription right
-PRON- be finally happy with the glass
but -PRON- know -PRON- be charge a minimum of 10x to 15x
what -PRON- cost to make
-PRON- will be go to cost co or wal mart for -PRON- eye exam from now on
more info here http:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/luxottica eyewear why be glass expensive\/

-PRON- would recommend anyone to try -PRON- out
-PRON- place be small but worth the wait if there be no available seat
grant -PRON- do have sensitive skin so -PRON- always have some swell afterward

great deal and look good but not worth the pain
if -PRON- skin be not so sensitive try -PRON-
this place hand down have the good pho in the valley
yes the place be dirty and a total dive but that just add to the experience if -PRON- be clean
-PRON- do not think -PRON- would be very good
-PRON- theory be that vietnamese place be usually a little dirty because -PRON- be good luck
the bbq pork bánh mì just make -PRON- mouth so damn horny

-PRON- do not understand what -PRON- mean
-PRON- then continue that becausr i keep -PRON- 2 personal water bottle for 2 day i have to pay $ 25 fee per day per bottle
this be just very stupid fot 5 star hotel
then i fond out that i have resort fee for $ 33 per day that include wifi and other aminitie but in reality wifi still cost $ 18 per hour on top of that fee to access from the room
-PRON- be just wait to hear that i have to pay additional god know how much because i be breathe and use oxygen from the room
not to mention that dining personnel be rude unfriendly and careless
-PRON- truly rather go to 2 star hotel and i know i be not be scamm with fridge weight
this being say i will never come back to this hotel not worth -PRON- time and money
hope this will hrlp
-PRON- save $ $ $ before decide to book this hotel
-PRON- do not normally write review but dor this one i have to
-PRON- feel trick into eat an early dinner
while walk thru the forum shops -PRON- see a sign for 3 slider $ 5.95 from 5:30 to 6:30 pm so -PRON- go into the restaurant
after be seat and try to order the slider special -PRON- be tell that be in the bar only no mention of this on the sign
-PRON- do not want to make a big deal of -PRON- so order off the menu instead
everything be very pricey and probably tasty but since -PRON- be early -PRON- be not that hungry
one of the item -PRON- have be apple and arugula salad
when -PRON- come to the table -PRON- be surprised to find that -PRON- be cover with nut
there be no mention of nut on the menu
although the palm may be a good place to eat -PRON- think -PRON- expect -PRON- to read between the line which -PRON- do not like
surrender be a great club but for anyone who ever need to pee aka everyone ever -PRON- have 2 toilet stall for the entire girl bathroom
-PRON- stand in line for 45 minute away from the table -PRON- friend have
2 toilet for the 100 girl per minute that have to go to the bathroom
poorly design and could be easily make a lot good
seem to be a small thing but everyone got to go
eat here this past weekend have see sign and want to try -PRON- out
-PRON- partner and -PRON- split the two can dine meal which include two burger two fry and two drink for under $ 20
-PRON- add cheese and pretty much every free topping -PRON- enjoy a messy burger

-PRON- be look forward to try some of -PRON- signature burger and the piri piri chicken
the only negative that -PRON- see be that -PRON- fry be a bit under salt for -PRON- taste but -PRON- be season with a bit of pepper which be quite nice
before -PRON- make -PRON- reservation -PRON- be a little worried
-PRON- call the number list on this review and the phone just ring and ring then the next try get -PRON- place on hold for a very long time
-PRON- would recommend use the hotel 's main number -PRON- get -PRON- through in about 15 second
the phone staff be very friendly and help -PRON- select the good service for -PRON- and -PRON- budget
-PRON- do not get the foot washing but that be okay
like everyone else -PRON- fall in absolute love with the robe
-PRON- be not a robe person but this one really impressed
-PRON- have discover -PRON- can get the same robe online from the distributor for a much more appealing price
-PRON- luck out and have the run of the place by -PRON-
ahh
-PRON- really love the amount of light in the spa usually -PRON- soak in a windowless room here the hot tub be face a huge window with view of the strip
there be chaise lounge build into the tub and each one will give -PRON- a bubble jet massage
the wet sauna be beautiful and -PRON- love the lighting
-PRON- do not really love the sensory shower even though -PRON- be hugely excited to try -PRON-
each experience be about 30 second long and -PRON- take a spell for -PRON- to start up
-PRON- would rather -PRON- take those out and put in something different
as for -PRON- treatment -PRON- do the hamam which -PRON- can do with a group
-PRON- be lovely
-PRON- be scrub buff and polish within an inch of -PRON- life while lounge on a warm marble slab
-PRON- be not sure how -PRON- will survive a regular shower
-PRON- facial be really relax and include a scalp treatment
-PRON- be not -PRON- favorite facial ever but -PRON- be nice
price be high but not compare to qua etc
-PRON- be a little put off -PRON- the check out form which have line for tip to the provider of course the spa attendant and the concierge
-PRON- book this hotel through hotels.com because -PRON- be go to see agt winner grace vanderwaal perform in -PRON- theatre
so -PRON- be convenient
-PRON- eat at -PRON- in house steak place which be awesome
john be be server and do a great job
but -PRON- have no hot water at -PRON- bathroom sink or shower
wtf
and -PRON- toilet run constantly throughout the night
and the tv which be what put -PRON- to sleep while watch cnn be set up incorrectly so that the video show cut off top and bottom section of the screen
so -PRON- would look at a different place to lay -PRON- head at night
-PRON- do waive the resort fee but -PRON- have to forego shower before fly home
call in -PRON- order at 5:15pm yesterday
be tell that -PRON- order would be ready in 25 minute
get there to try and pick up -PRON- order and should have know -PRON- would take long when the person in front of -PRON- be wait for almost an hour for -PRON- order
no one acknowledge -PRON- for at least 20 minute and when -PRON- finally get someone -PRON- at first say that -PRON- could not find -PRON- name
and -PRON- tell -PRON- again
and -PRON- finally find -PRON-
-PRON- be tell -PRON- be only a few minute
and -PRON- would be ready
after wait for 30 35 minute -PRON- still do not get -PRON- food and -PRON- try to get a manager and that take 10 minute to get
finally get -PRON- food at 7:30pm
now on -PRON- will go to portofino 's from now on

there be a few decent staff member and t be a great bartender but neither be there today as -PRON- be acknowledge as -PRON- enter but not even ask for -PRON- drink order after sit for 10 minute
take -PRON- regular business elsewhere
the owner of the luxe pet hotel truly care for the dog under -PRON- care
-PRON- family and -PRON- go on vacation and take -PRON- dog with -PRON-
luckily this location accept dog who be not fix
-PRON- be extremely apprehensive about leave -PRON- dog under the care of someone else even if -PRON- be just for a few hour but the lady who take -PRON- dog reassure -PRON- that -PRON- would be okay and that -PRON- would take good care of -PRON-
-PRON- spend a bit of time on the strip and return in 3 hour to pick up -PRON- dog
everything go well and would bring -PRON- dog back to this location

-PRON- be amazing at what -PRON- do
-PRON- also take -PRON- mom for a haircut with hannah and -PRON- give -PRON- a great bob look
the price be a little on high side and -PRON- must book in adavance

the price be also nice and worth -PRON-
there be very few people at the time -PRON- wife and -PRON- arrive with the number of seat available at the bar and the table yet -PRON- take approximately 20 minute to seat -PRON-
service be extremely bad and the food be average and over price save -PRON- some money and frustration eat somewhere else
do not be dismay by the line
-PRON- may be jade after line up for what seem like hour for japanese cheese base delicacy nearby but the line be not as bad as -PRON- seem and the reward at the end justify the mean
the noodle be delicious and fill and the broth will warm -PRON- up on the cold day
-PRON- only thought be that -PRON- noodle stick together a bit make -PRON- difficult to eat without splash soup all over -PRON-
-PRON- order the medium flat noodle
next time -PRON- will try a small size
come hungry leave happy
note noodle price have get up $ 1 compare to the photo of the menu be post
skip the late night menu
-PRON- group go here around 11:00 pm so -PRON- miss the dinner menu
-PRON- be all pretty hungry so when -PRON- order the chicken skewer and this pinky sized piece of meat on a stick $ 7 just one come out -PRON- immediately have to order 2 other item know this would not come close to fill -PRON- up
so -PRON- order miso soup $ 5
do -PRON- get a bowl of hot steaming miso

-PRON- get a shot of -PRON-
everything be overly spicy also

service be slllooooowww even with the 4 different waiter -PRON- have
-PRON- will say -PRON- serve a killer bloody mary

all in all -PRON- will leave starving and break
diana at push be the good

so -PRON- could continue paint the town red
next time -PRON- set a reservation make sure -PRON- request diana
this place be a huge disgrace and the bad mcdonalds -PRON- have ever be to
the employee would not know service if -PRON- bite -PRON- in the foot
the beeping of the timer be non stop every time -PRON- have be there
-PRON- be not sure the help know what the beeping mean
there be never anybody in there but good luck on -PRON- even help -PRON-
-PRON- feel like -PRON- be bother -PRON- by even show up
soda be dead flat
complain and just get the not -PRON- problem look
how do a owner put down this kind of money to run this $ $ $ $ franchise and have -PRON- run like a flop house
mind boggle
keep drive and save -PRON- the major letdown
this be -PRON- first experience at phoenix city grille and -PRON- be incredible
-PRON- friend and -PRON- both order the pcg chicken pasta and the flavor be out of this world

-PRON- generally assume everything be go to be the same at a give chain restaurant
but -PRON- seem to take extra care here to make thing look good presentation wise

at the recommendation of the server for -PRON- specifically -PRON- have the beijing beef salad which -PRON- think be funny
-PRON- be one of two asians there and be somewhat skeptical at first in try to figure out how -PRON- would bastardize\/reinterpret chinese food
surprisingly -PRON- be pretty good though maybe slightly on the salty side or -PRON- taste
-PRON- seem like a fairly good sized portion with noodle + dressing and beef unspecified be cook medium rare
this be $ 13 pre tax
the person next to -PRON- have the chicken santorini which also look really good and be wish -PRON- have get initially chicken breast + red pepper and feta along with whole wheat pasta with tomato sauce at a cost of $ 17

bar\/grill type environment
the service be pretty good
-PRON- forget -PRON- second drink but -PRON- provide -PRON- with compliment when -PRON- realize the mistake though -PRON- be a coke
so -PRON- be not sure if refill be complimentary or
-PRON- be because -PRON- forget to bring -PRON- to -PRON- initially
and -PRON- do not bother to ask
-PRON- be a group of 9 people
-PRON- do not know at what point the mandate service charge kick in but -PRON- do for -PRON- which be both convenient and annoying in a way
-PRON- suspect -PRON- would get good tip if -PRON- be at the individual 's discretion
order the up north meal 3pc bone in + waffle $ 14 plus tax
seating be limit
food be mediocre but -PRON- would not come back again

zum haupgang paella mit fleisch und muscheln bestellt
auf der paella waren aber leider keine muscheln
jedoch sehr viel puten und schweinefleisch
das schweinefleisch war leider sehr durchwachsen
salat war mit fertigdressing angemacht
bedienung war freundlich
avoid this apartment complex
the exterior and interior be nice however the nals management that take over be awful
-PRON- staff be rude and -PRON- get rid of the any nice employee -PRON- have
the pool be always fill with trash from little kid play in there with no parent
majority of the time all the pool be close and -PRON- do not put up sign explain why or when -PRON- will reopen
the security be lazy
-PRON- would use the gym at night and the guard would be in there for over an hour just watch tv
the apartment above -PRON- be break in to and there be a lot of police activity
-PRON- also tow everyone on -PRON- side of the complex 's car
have to pay $ 600 to get -PRON- two car back
the office should have do a good job inform -PRON- resident
-PRON- truly do not care about the people live and pay rent
-PRON- also charge a $ 10 admin fee when pay rent which be ridiculous
ton of roach by the way too
when -PRON- move out -PRON- leave -PRON- apartment very clean and there be no stain in the carpet yet -PRON- be still charge a large fee for clean when -PRON- clean -PRON- apartment very well
nal have make this apartment complex run down and -PRON- be happy to be out of -PRON-
if -PRON- enjoy pay for amenity -PRON- can not use half the time and awful staff with a security guard who may as well not be there then by all mean enjoy
there be a few thai restaurant in this area but none good than thai gourmet
-PRON- order chicken satay pad thai beef masaman curry pho and sticky rice and mango for dessert
all be absolutely wonderful and have fresh ingredient and authentic thai flavor
the staff be very friendly prompt and courteous
the owner personally ensure -PRON- have everything make just the way -PRON- want and genuinely care that -PRON- enjoy -PRON- dining experience
if -PRON- like thai food this be the place to get -PRON-
love del frisco 's if -PRON- can swing -PRON- one of the top place for a meal in charlotte
one of the few place that feel as grand as the price
wine list be among the good in the city but -PRON- definitely pay for -PRON-
great for special occasion or if -PRON- want to impress
server be all top notch and the food practically perfect
terribly slow and rude service
perhaps -PRON- should wait to try the food but -PRON- have be here an hour and with no food in sight
-PRON- be leave with no option but to judge the establishment on the incredibly poor treatment of customer
how a las vegas establishment get away with this type of service be beyond -PRON-
hostess be rude and apathetic drink waitress be rude and possibly suicidal and the real waitress be very confused about the relatively few item on -PRON- menu
wow
beautiful hotel love the room love the pool love the food love the bed
fun vibe
when -PRON- have bad thing to say about a place -PRON- go in to detail
when -PRON- have great thing to say -PRON- only need two word
this place be a two word place
wow wow suggestion never hurt thou service need a little help in time management but -PRON- be the nice and polite service -PRON- get to say
note
this review be from the perspective of a 42 year old who have yet to get old
in vegas with a group of 30 40ish single married gf who love to dance
-PRON- go to this place twice during -PRON- trip both time free with free drink
in -PRON- opinion the decor be kind of personality less at least with the light down low
nothing really pop out
-PRON- all like the small size of the club and the outdoor patio where -PRON- could sit down and cool off -PRON- would be nice if the music be mute a bit out there so -PRON- could have an actual conversation which be impossible anywhere in this club
-PRON- bartender be a total jerk as soon as -PRON- see -PRON- be use -PRON- free drink wristband as if -PRON- wouldn't???)
-PRON- never go back to the bar again on either visit even when -PRON- feel like actually buy a drink
the first time -PRON- go be a thursday night
-PRON- arrive at 10:30 pm to an empty club
the only benefit of this early arrival be vip seating on the couch off to the side of the dance floor
for about the first hour the music be a bit too techno and -PRON- lose one of -PRON- friend to -PRON- bed upstairs
then -PRON- be like the dj get a sudden clue and play excellent music for the rest of the night
-PRON- dance the night away with a british guy travel alone who -PRON- adopt as -PRON- permanent dance partner
saturday night -PRON- return after be disappoint by long line or a lack of dance at a couple of other place around town
even though -PRON- be a few minute to midnight -PRON- get in for free again too crowded to get a vip table so -PRON- just stay on the dance floor all night
the crowd be definitely wilder this time
and -PRON- be pretty jammed
the dj do not disappoint -PRON- and play perfect music all night long
there be some dirty dancing go on but not nearly the level that -PRON- encounter at pure some of -PRON- be claim but -PRON- be pretty easy to escape if -PRON- want to
the crowd be a little bit old
-PRON- think -PRON- see some guy who have be shave for at least 10 year
-PRON- end up be stalk the entire night by a pretty strange european guy with a wander mouth and hand
-PRON- let -PRON- hang around simply to serve as eye candy
between -PRON- be firm and club security watch out for -PRON- -PRON- never feel unsafe
however after sober up later that night and have an audible conversation with -PRON- friend -PRON- do believe -PRON- dance the night away with a burgeon serial killer -PRON- will go back here for a night of dancing when -PRON- be back in vegas for another girl weekend
very cute
a little something for everyone even -PRON- dog
the only thing be people stop throw -PRON- trash on the ground and -PRON- wish there be a no smoking sign or something
do -PRON- think that -PRON- would die tonight
oh do -PRON- think -PRON- would die -----------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­-----------------------
quick review ™
open from reveille to retreat
for the purpose of contextualization of this review reveille sunrise retreat sunset
some famous interment diego chico corrale tony curtis moe dalitz redd foxx dolores fuller danny gans hank greenspan jay sarno frank sawyer stu unger et al -----------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­-----------------------
-PRON- do not have any family member or friend bury here
as of the date of this review -PRON- be not bury here either
-PRON- know this be go to be crush to some reader
-PRON- firsthand experience consist of visit this cemetery to reflect on life and death
and local history
and live
and the cost of loss
and if a loss be really a loss if -PRON- do not in the end cost one 's life
and if -PRON- be ready to risk die in order to win
and if that be worth -PRON-
-----------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­-----------------------
-PRON- favourite place of reflection be at the final resting site of world champion diego chico corrale
corrale be lay to rest here and if -PRON- need to learn who this man be but only have three minute to do so -PRON- highly suggest view the following https:\/\/youtu.be\/i0vspewcmx4
-PRON- have pay homage to -PRON- graveside over the year whenever -PRON- ever need a boost of courage for compete in combat sport
respectful not to disturb -PRON- family during -PRON- visit -PRON- make certain to go before or after any significant anniversary such as -PRON- birthday or the date of the legendary castillo fight which also coincide with the date of -PRON- untimely death two year to the date
-PRON- be only twenty nine year old
in addition to corrale there be many other athlete politician entertainer and mobster bury here
and veteran
-----------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­-----------------------
-PRON- have have one negative experience here
the security staff professional post at the gate one late afternoon get unnecessarily testy because -PRON- be attempt ingress at that time of day
frankly at that time -PRON- do not even realise that the hour be from reveille to retreat and -PRON- be not even after retreat anyway
this guy could be more mindful that not every one automatically know that the hour be from sunrise to sunset
-----------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­-----------------------
pro tip
the hour be from sunrise to sunset
do not fathom come anytime close to sunset because paul blart will get ya

je commence a être pas mal habitué a cette chaine de restauration rapide mai plus santé que plusieur autre
celui de l'île perrot est aussi propre et efficace que les autre
la soupe yum yum aux crevett ainsi que celle au poulet était très bonne avec juste assez de citronnelle
avec le combo je commande habituellement un rouleau printanier mai
a ce resto
il semble qu'il n'en servent pas
seulement l'impérial qui est frit
j'en commande donc un et ce fut le point faible du repa
rien de grave mai c' du congelé que je -PRON- fait a l'occasion en manque d'inspiration et de temp a la maison
le poulet général thaï comme il est nommé ici était très correct
excellent service au comptoir et très rapide
very pleased with the result
-PRON- replace a large dual pain window in an upstairs family room
-PRON- be a tricky install with -PRON- have to walk on a clay tile roof
-PRON- be nervous about lot of tile be crack
-PRON- send a crew of 3 to do the install and be extremely careful on the tile roof
only 1 tile be break and that be not bad at all
these guy do a great job and be very professional
-PRON- would recommend -PRON-
the food be delicious but the service be so so
after be sit at -PRON- table -PRON- take about 15 minute before the waitress come to check on -PRON-
after -PRON- food be order -PRON- do not take long for the sushi to come out but after that -PRON- come back maybe 3 time during -PRON- 1.5 dinner
more likely -PRON- will not be go back
-PRON- be only write this review from the perspective of a patron and performer and not a student of the bad dog
-PRON- have perform here a couple of time
the dressing room be spacious enough for a large cast of folk say 8 perhaps comfortably and -PRON- cover with poster from previous show which give -PRON- -PRON- own history and flair
through black curtain performer come onto a very small stage paint all in black that lend -PRON- well to setless act specifically improv
-PRON- have see a few thing here and -PRON- have be enjoyable but i do not know that i can associate that with the bad dog -PRON- as the space can be rent out like any other
if i go there i go there for the act
-PRON- can grab a chocolate bar or some water maybe even a pop and seat -PRON- in a tiered audience of about 60 seat and usually have -PRON- view block slightly by someone head
but -PRON- likely will not pay a lot to go in
and -PRON- could see some super stuff
so if the show tickle -PRON- fancy the bare bone be well worth the time spend
good dk dog in the world
fast service
great customer service
owner glen be really nice and style to talk to -PRON- about these amazing dog
the viking be -PRON- favorite
do not forget -PRON- jar of danish pickle cucumber
az 88 be a great spot in scottsdale for cool vibe and a cool atmosphere
-PRON- be locate at the scottsdale civic center and the patio over look the scottsdale center for the art
if -PRON- be look for a good patio in the area definitely check -PRON- out
the menu be good try to be interesting
but -PRON- be just variation of appetizer salad and chicken sandwich
-PRON- be a casual menu with an upscale twist which be nice for the area
the price be pretty reasonable also
salads and sandwiches be $ 12-$14 and the portion be a good size
the drink menu be also very impressive with ton of wine rum and craft beer to choose from
-PRON- start with the house make chip with lox and cream cheese on top
huge portion
but -PRON- think -PRON- forget half the lox
interesting dish
but -PRON- probably will not order -PRON- again
-PRON- have the az 88 salad for dinner which be great
-PRON- be a chop salad with grill buffalo chicken on top
the sandwich come with waffle fry which be always a plus in -PRON- book
yummy deliciouuuuus mole
a bit too pricey for tacos\/mexican food
place be very small
salsa selection be very interesting lot of different one some that -PRON- have never see in -PRON- life and -PRON- be mexican
-PRON- will definitely try -PRON- quesadilla if -PRON- decide to give -PRON- another chance
love love love
-PRON- decide to go with a chain in an effort to relieve some of -PRON- worry of never have be to the restaurant that be go to be host -PRON- wedding reception
and while -PRON- be part of a chain -PRON- be nice to know a little of what to expect
because -PRON- use -PRON- for -PRON- reception -PRON- be review -PRON- private dining
-PRON- then husband to be
and -PRON- first see this grand lux the day before -PRON- wedding when -PRON- go to pay off -PRON- balance
-PRON- do not want to have to worry about this the day of
-PRON- meet with the manager who be so welcome and not in the fake y way that -PRON- -PRON- be often accuse of -PRON- only have a total of 15 guest make -PRON- way to vegas and -PRON- be sure that this size of private party be peanut to this establishment
but -PRON- would never know -PRON- from the way the staff treat -PRON-
after pay the remainder of -PRON- bill -PRON- ask to see the room where -PRON- reception would be help and the manager take -PRON- through the kitchen to reach the room
the kitchen staff welcome -PRON- but also do not seem surprised to see patron off the street and after 8 + hour of travel in the back of the house
say a lot about how the restaurant be run
-PRON- reception be perfection
-PRON- only have one server
-PRON- be embarrassed
-PRON- do not remember -PRON- name probably b\/c
-PRON- make sure -PRON- hand always have a fresh glass of wine in -PRON-
but -PRON- be amazing
-PRON- keep everything run smoothly and everyone extremely happy
the food be great -PRON- guest have the option of a chicken madreidra miso salmon or pasta fresca and -PRON- hear everything -PRON- never have the chance to try be perfect

especially in vegas
highly highly recommend
ambiance
-PRON- like that -PRON- have a stage upbeat music happy hour
and -PRON- can see the kitchen
re
good look staff
-PRON- have a handsome waiter the other young lady be just average look
the chair have wear out cushion and i sink in -PRON-
the food be good but a few discrepancy on the menu the butternut squash cannelloni be actually ravioli
do -PRON- reviewer not know the difference
and there be suppose to be corn white asparagus and sugar snap or snow pea with include but be miss
-PRON- would have add to the overall taste value and nutrition of the menu
appetizers order the mussel and get a great portion with a wonderful broth and superb toasty bread for dipping
a few of the mussel have an off taste though
also a port cheese from france which -PRON- think would have a port wine swirl through -PRON-
but -PRON- be very tasty
serve with a berry jam -PRON- would have prefer a crushed olive dipper
for $ 4 -PRON- can not complain
desert carmel corn custard something or other more than for one person
-PRON- be more sweet than an expect sweet and salty
share the entire meal and -PRON- come to 51.and change
good deal for 2 lady who be watch -PRON- calorie intake and want something different
will be back for appetizer and happy hour
of note again -PRON- be a seasoned fish and chipper-- please serve malt vinegar at the table when serve
the coleslaw look very healthy not mushy
holy diver this be the bad f*ck meal -PRON- have eat in a long time
-PRON- would like to preface this by say maybe this be the one time -PRON- suck and by point out -PRON- do eat all of -PRON- food
maybe that be why -PRON- be so damn p*ss off
-PRON- be so hungry
-PRON- eat every bite of -PRON- garbage sandwich
usually the whole starve thing make anything taste good
-PRON- walk in and the place be beautiful
seat -PRON- and a super friendly waitress who be clearly in the weed come over pretty quick and take -PRON- order of beer sweet tea and crab dip
sweet tea be good husband say beer be good
crab dip arrive 30 minute later and be also good
-PRON- attribute this exclusively to butter
unfortunately the bread be burned turn out this be intentional
-PRON- ask for untoasted bread and give -PRON- dark brown crap back
-PRON- order two sandwich
waitress leave
-PRON- finish -PRON- drink and sit with empty cup and no bread -PRON- sandwich come
the edge of the meat in -PRON- sandwich be burn and -PRON- husband say -PRON- sandwich taste like -PRON- be make hour ago and have just be sit there wait to be order
-PRON- finish -PRON- food and then get -PRON- refill
still no bread
drink more
the bread come
-PRON- be burn like the first round possibly a shade lighter
possibly
so -PRON- guess -PRON- be intentional but ugh
bill of $ 46 of the bad dollar -PRON- ever spend show up
-PRON- pay tip and leave
-PRON- be so damn furious for have sit through that bullsh*t
this review would be incomplete without profanity
utter garbage
waitress be super nice but totally overwhelmed
if -PRON- want to sit in a beautiful place and drink cold beer come to omb
-PRON- be a brewery after all
if -PRON- be hungry go anywhere else in charlotte
the food at omb suck so bad
-PRON- have be warn
if omb invite -PRON- back for a free meal as the only patron in the restaurant to make up for the experience -PRON- just have -PRON- would decline
the food be that terrible
the one star be for the serve staff who be again really nice otherwise no star
annie o
-PRON- be here a couple of time and every visit keep get good and good
on -PRON- last visit -PRON- order the fish fillet with white rice and a side salad
the fish be really tender and juicy -PRON- get 2 big fillet over a bed of bell pepper and onion
the price be good for the amount of food that -PRON- be get
-PRON- get what -PRON- pay for do not apply here
la comida es espectacular la atención es increíble recomiendo este restaurante pedimo agua de coco pescado frito y costilla todo estaba delicioso la carta es muy variada
do not stay here
this place be invest with stink bugs and management
will not attempt to do anything about it
also -PRON- do not always provide clean towel even if -PRON- leave -PRON- on the floor which indicate -PRON- would like -PRON- change
-PRON- suspect this so i test the clean team
-PRON- be right i be give the same dirty towel i have leave on the floor
-PRON- pick -PRON- up off of the dirty bathroom floor fold -PRON- and hang -PRON- up
-PRON- be give a survey and answer honestly
well i unfortunately have to return to this hotel three week later as i be travel for business and -PRON- company make -PRON- stay there
when i return the staff usually very polite be very rude to -PRON-
-PRON- guess -PRON- receive -PRON- survey and be not happy about -PRON-
-PRON- have be in customer service for over 15 year
in -PRON- experience when a customer complete a survey show -PRON- dissatisfaction -PRON- do whatev -PRON- can to make -PRON- right
this establishment do not have the same thought i guess
-PRON- wonder if -PRON- parent company marriott know -PRON- be be treat -PRON- guest in this way
-PRON- have share -PRON- complaint with -PRON- company in an effort to get -PRON- to switch hotel
as many other have also do -PRON- stop in here after take a day trip to cave of the mounds
this place be great
-PRON- eat in the downstairs pub part fantastic menu with lot of great pub fare like fish and chip burger brat and so on
and -PRON- beer selection be really nice too
relaxed atmosphere and at least for lunch very kid friendly
-PRON- server even bring the kid freeze pop for dessert after -PRON- finish -PRON- food
-PRON- have a great kid menu too by the way
well worth the stop if -PRON- be in the area
oh and definitely get the giant pretzel appetizer
jk sushi be a great local spot where -PRON- get great service
chan be -PRON- server tonight and -PRON- be always attentive
this be -PRON- go to spot for catch up with friend for a nice korean dish a side of sushi and a sake bomb to top off -PRON- meal
chan be always friendly and always remember what -PRON- previously order and make great suggestion that never fail
-PRON- get there and -PRON- be freeezing
cold
the lady in front of -PRON- walk in and -PRON- get seat -PRON- wait for about 10 minute to get back to so -PRON- end up just go to the bar instead
the bartendar be really nice super friendly awesome
however -PRON- keep switching roll mean bartendar and another waitress
-PRON- order the breadstick sandwhich -PRON- be really good however .wayyyyyy
toooo much salt
-PRON- honestly take a couple bite out of -PRON- and lose -PRON- appetite due to the amount of salt on -PRON-
when -PRON- be ready to leave -PRON- seem as the bartendar and waitress be busy chat and so -PRON- take a while to get someone to give -PRON- -PRON- check
food be alright service be alright
one of the bad place to do service
-PRON- go for oil change and tell -PRON- that -PRON- car need list of thing need to changed
-PRON- do the service which be not require at all
-PRON- lose lot of money with these
total cheater
with fire 's reputation and price -PRON- be expect to have an experience that -PRON- would remember
well -PRON- do not
do not get -PRON- wrong the food be not bad -PRON- be good
-PRON- just do not blow -PRON- away and for the price -PRON- be expect -PRON- to
the restaurant be gorgeous and the staff be friendly and professional
the owner come to -PRON- table and thank -PRON- for come -PRON- think that be classy
-PRON- would return maybe if -PRON- have a happy hour
or -PRON- have a coupon
great food at low price
.this be the only buffet -PRON- have ever see that do not charge dinner price all daylong on the weekend
the sushi fresh and varied the general chicken be perfect -PRON- do wish -PRON- have chicken wing on the weekend instead of fullsize chicken
drumsticks.i can not say enough about the food employee and pricing .my
picture be current as of the writing of this review
as a new business start out -PRON- have no idea how important seo and reputation management would be -PRON- never hear of these term before -PRON- embark on this endeavor
-PRON- be nowhere to be find on google yahoo etc
-PRON- desperately need internet visibility- immediately
-PRON- try a couple different company in which -PRON- spend a ton of money with little to no result
a friend recommend gary and big mouth seo as -PRON- use -PRON- and be see result within 3 month of -PRON- take over -PRON- account
-PRON- be surprised how reasonable the rate be especially compare to the other -PRON- use and research
gary and dave and all the other be always available to answer -PRON- question and -PRON- have a lot
-PRON- be always keep abreast of -PRON- ranking and -PRON- be happy to report -PRON- business be right there on the coveted page 1 and there -PRON- remain
-PRON- have no idea what a difference this would make in -PRON- business-
-PRON- be now expand and be glad gary and -PRON- entire team will be there with -PRON-
-PRON- truly save -PRON- business
-PRON- would highly highly recommend big mouth seo
thank -PRON- all so much
so -PRON- visit thyme 2 today after international f
-PRON- would give 3 and 1\/2 if yelp allow half star rating
the good food be more than decent
the mediterranean pizza be yummy the special which be a chicken sandwich be very good
-PRON- salad once -PRON- have dress be good
-PRON- have beer on tap so that be always nice
the not so good 1
-PRON- waiter seem to be very unhappy have to be there
-PRON- dampen the experience and put the group in a bad mood
do not be a waiter if -PRON- can not at the very least be kind to people who have not do anything to deserve -PRON- attitude
2 -PRON- clean the table with a very strong smell disinfectant
not appetiz at all
3 over salt french fry
-PRON- be good just tone -PRON- back a tiny bit
4
-PRON- salad the mixed green need to have more dressing
-PRON- taste like there be a table spoon on there
maybe
5 the mountain dew taste like straight syrup
6 both -PRON- glass and one of -PRON- compadre glass be chip
probably should not use glass that can result in a lawsuit
overall the food mostly be what save the experience
-PRON- would go back and give -PRON- a second chance
the customer service people at least at this taco bell be name customer maniac
-PRON- do receive jazz hand when -PRON- walk through the door so -PRON- be excited to see -PRON-
the food be prepare to -PRON- enjoyment
the chicken soft taco be hot and the mountain dew baja blast be ice cold
thank -PRON- taco bell paul the customer maniac for provide a good experience
shayenne be the good
-PRON- always hook up -PRON- fry real quick
-PRON- be awful at do -PRON- own hair
so when -PRON- discover blowout dollhouse -PRON- life get so much easy -PRON- hair so much sexy
-PRON- get blowout here on a weekly basis because -PRON- price be affordable and the service be awesome
-PRON- stylist be angie -PRON- have master the perfect blowout for -PRON- hair
latoya the owner do a wonderful job at design an adorable salon that feel like a second home to -PRON-
-PRON- have a great team of friendly staff that can all do bombshell blowout
-PRON- also conveniently provide mobile blowout where the stylist come to -PRON-
lauren be -PRON- mobile stylist and -PRON- be amazing too
whenever -PRON- do not have time to make -PRON- into the salon -PRON- be so flexible with -PRON- schedule
-PRON- have last minute save -PRON- hair from look flat boring countless time
-PRON- highly recommend -PRON-
thoroughly disgust with -PRON- trip to northlake amc tonight
first off let -PRON- say that northlake in the past have be fine
-PRON- recommend weekday or week night visit but weekend night be ridiculous
-PRON- pay $ 10 for a rat r movie
-PRON- do not even get to enjoy because of the number of rude underage teenager in the theatre
-PRON- talk texted scream and cuss through the whole movie
the entire theatre experience be rather ghetto
the staff and kid be all ghetto tonight
-PRON- complain and no one come to investigate
-PRON- will not be go back to northlake on a weekend night
-PRON- recommend skip northlake and head north to birkdale or south to the epicentre
maybe then -PRON- will hear less baby daddy talk and more of the movie -PRON- pay for
-PRON- have be tell that the cake at lovecrumbs be superb which be why -PRON- be so excited to hear that -PRON- would be pay the café a visit to celebrate the birthday of jennie
s. a large crowd of -PRON-
-PRON- be meet which mean -PRON- have to share a table and by share
-PRON- mean overwhelm the poor chap quietly sit read -PRON- book at a table that sit 6 people
the décor inside be a bit of a hodge podge with lot of mis match table and chair
and -PRON- think the table -PRON- sit at be the large there
rather than a glass display cabinet all the cake be keep in an open cupboard for -PRON- to get a good look at the tasty treat on offer
-PRON- be a nice rustic kind of way to display -PRON- good
-PRON- do not have a sweet tooth
but -PRON- have a soft spot for brownie
so -PRON- make a snap decision and order the caramel brownie and some breakfast blend tea
while -PRON- order at the counter -PRON- bring -PRON- order over to -PRON- so there be no risk of -PRON- spill tea on -PRON- toe
-PRON- must admit -PRON- have an ulterior notice to pick a caramel brownie -PRON- have make salt caramel brownie -PRON-
and -PRON- want to see how -PRON- would measure up against the professional
in truth -PRON- could not even finish -PRON- brownie
-PRON- have about 2 small forkful and have to admit defeat and push -PRON- away
-PRON- be just way too sweet for -PRON- -PRON- could practically feel -PRON- tooth melt in -PRON- mouth
-PRON- donate -PRON- brownie to the rest of the table for -PRON- to try and -PRON- feel the same way glad -PRON- be not just -PRON- then
be starve -PRON- go and get a yummy cheese and sundri tomato scone to have with -PRON- tea instead
now the big problem with -PRON- visit be that -PRON- have not have any lunch that day
-PRON- have mistakenly assume that -PRON- would be able to get a little soup or something when -PRON- go to lovecrumbs
unfortunately -PRON- serve nothing but cake
-PRON- applaud the idea -PRON- stick to the thing -PRON- do really well and -PRON- do amazing cake but -PRON- find -PRON- odd to go to a tea room and not to be able to get anything but cake
please bear this in mind when -PRON- go if -PRON- be hungry -PRON- may be worth go somewhere for lunch first and then go to lovecrumbs afterward for dessert
-PRON- honestly think -PRON- just have a bad experience in term of the cake choice -PRON- make that day
lovecrumb also provide the yelp birthday cake that -PRON- have at yelp edinburgh 's second birthday party
-PRON- be huge and tasty as hell with a delicate sponge with hint of cardamom and zingy raspberry jam in the middle
-PRON- really redeem the cake on offer in -PRON- eye and -PRON- have decide to go back and try the place again
this time -PRON- will be sure to ask the staff for -PRON- advice and not make greedy cake choice
delicious and unique experience
when -PRON- arrive -PRON- be initially skeptical use to place that have hype up -PRON- fare to draw the crowd
luciano 's do not rely on hype -PRON- rely on excellent food and word of mouth
the chef native to italy return every year to bring back fresh ingredient such as olive oil that add that extra touch of flavor to the dish
-PRON- then come to -PRON- table not only to check to ensure that -PRON- food be as -PRON- should be but also to make the good caesar salad and dress from scratch that -PRON- will ever have
the wine list do not fail and -PRON- may want to ask to be seat in a corner the good to hide from view when -PRON- can not help but practically lick -PRON- plate
-PRON- love vietnamese food
-PRON- be a chilly with and a good pho be what -PRON- need
-PRON- enter the restaurant and nobody to greet -PRON-
finally a woman point to a table and -PRON- sit down
then -PRON- ask how can -PRON- help -PRON-
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- would be nice if -PRON- have menu
-PRON- bring -PRON- one
-PRON- ask for another
then another woman come over who be obviously the hostess
-PRON- ask if -PRON- could make suggestion
-PRON- ask if -PRON- have any seafood pho
and -PRON- say no
well -PRON- do not eat red meat so that be a deal breaker
-PRON- say thank and leave
-PRON- be obsess
love the shop love the service love daniel and michael love the nail
by far the good service -PRON- have ever have
sns be amazing as well
xo herbal nails
attend a retirement luncheon for 14
-PRON- order salmon and be very specific about have -PRON- cook thoroughly
when -PRON- come -PRON- immediately cut into -PRON- and -PRON- be raw
-PRON- send -PRON- back and although -PRON- appreciate have -PRON- cook correctly -PRON- sit while everyone around -PRON- eat and just about finish -PRON-
-PRON- quickly eat -PRON- since -PRON- all have to go back to work
-PRON- guess more attention need to be pay to how the customer want -PRON- food to avoid this in the future
-PRON- have chicken tempura udon and kakiage rice bowl
this be -PRON- first time here
and -PRON- really enjoy -PRON-
-PRON- be nearly at capacity when -PRON- go
and -PRON- gladly accept a seat at the bar that look into the kitchen which -PRON- love anyways
-PRON- be always nice to watch the cook in action
-PRON- find the food delicious and the server extra polite and friendly
-PRON- will be back
these be big bowl of udon
so -PRON- be definitely a meal unto -PRON-
-PRON- be visit lowdown because -PRON- want a coffee and cake and somewhere to work for an hour or so
sadly -PRON- plan be scupper by the fact that this place be totally full and there be not a spare seat in sight so -PRON- grab a coffee to go instead
if -PRON- be not sure where to head follow the map on yelp and look for the sandwich board outside
-PRON- be downstairs and the space be pretty small there be not a tonne of seating so -PRON- will be lucky to get a seat maybe 15 20 seat inside -PRON- think
the staff be super friendly and -PRON- order -PRON- americano to go £ 2.40
-PRON- also have a peek at the menu which sound really good granola and yoghurt bagel soup salad sandwich and cake galore -PRON- have add a pic of the full menu on offer the day -PRON- visit
-PRON- also sell jarritos which be a bit unusual
-PRON- coffee do not take long -PRON- apologise for the wait
but -PRON- reckon -PRON- be only 3 minute anyway
and off -PRON- go
-PRON- be a pretty new coffee drinker and really enjoy this one even without sugar
so that be a win for -PRON-
-PRON- will definitely be back here and -PRON- be well worth a visit in an area ram with chain coffee shop
great place for adult and kid
-PRON- love come here
good food great service attentive staff
great for birthday dinner too
also vegetarian friendly
have -PRON- first nail appointment with jenny today and what a pleasure
the shop and decor be sophisticated modern and very very clean
jenny be personable and do exactly what -PRON- ask of -PRON-
so glad -PRON- read the yelp review and agree with all those who have high rating for the shop and for jenny
-PRON- definitely will be return for the excellent service and jennys calm friendly demeanor
thank -PRON- jenny
love this place
the food be great the service be great -PRON- can not get much good than this
highly recommend come here before any game or concert
unfortunately after -PRON- last visit to aldi
-PRON- have to update -PRON- review
-PRON- doubt -PRON- will return event though -PRON- be the close grocery to where -PRON- live
this shopping trip be on a sunday which be prime time
there be no cart to be find but -PRON- figure -PRON- would be able to carry what -PRON- need
-PRON- grab a few item and while walk around the store -PRON- see something disturb one of -PRON- pot roast package have clearly go bad with green spot all over the meat
obviously -PRON- skip on grab any meat and go to the check out where -PRON- try to grab one more item and spill everything in -PRON- hand
this would have be fine since -PRON- mostly have can and package item
but -PRON- have a container of blue berry that spill everywhere
this be where aldi completely lose -PRON- since an employee walk right by -PRON- and do not offer paper towel or help as -PRON- be on -PRON- hand and knee try to clean up
-PRON- collect most of the errant berry and go to grab another container
when -PRON- get to the produce area -PRON- be clear that many people have grab blueberry and the bottom layer be reveal and the entire selection of blue berry be cover in mold
-PRON- be completely disgusting
in -PRON- previous review -PRON- mention sometimes that -PRON- grab produce that have go squishy which be not good but these be flaw that could not be see by staff to know -PRON- need to throw out the item
the rancid meat and moldy blueberry
and this be a whole section not just one or two package be obvious to the naked eye and there be no excuse for -PRON- to still be on the shelf
-PRON- be a little anxious booking here as the review be not great but -PRON- experience be quite good
originally -PRON- be book at the nearby springhill only to find that -PRON- be in a sketch area next to a strip club so nope to that
the property look recently renovate or at least -PRON- room be
on the plus side -PRON- do not have a connect door in -PRON- room on the minus side the air con be a little loud and -PRON- shower curtain liner need a change
be aware that there be not anything in walk distance so -PRON- will need a car to get to any restaurant
this location do have a restaurant serve a limited menu at breakfast and dinner -PRON- eat there
and -PRON- be fine but expensive
there be an airport shuttle a workout room and a pool close during -PRON- visit for maintenance
wifi be free but never work well for -PRON- in the room good in the lobby area
staff be pretty great everyone from the front desk to the bistro people be super nice
because -PRON- be near the airport -PRON- will hear plane noise duh but -PRON- do not find -PRON- to be a problem
overall a solid stay
be a chinaman -PRON- would rate this outlet five star just on value alone since there be a great selection of store and -PRON- be a helluva lot closer than drive out to cabazon
two thing bring -PRON- down to four star though 1
-PRON- do not enjoy shop when -PRON- be 108f outside
2
-PRON- think -PRON- see a coffee shop in the food plaza because -PRON- all need coffee when -PRON- be stupid hot outside seriously where be the bar
-PRON- would love to shop here longer if there be a beer garden
one of -PRON- favorite spot
the salt caramel brownie and peanut butter chocolate petit four be so bomb
check into this hotel be a very unpleasant experience
-PRON- be stay in a different hotel for a couple day before -PRON- decide to give this one a try and the receptionist ask why -PRON- do not just extend -PRON- stay in the last hotel for the remainder of -PRON- time in montreal
-PRON- find that very unwelcoming and unnecessary of -PRON- to say
other than the horrible customer service -PRON- be in a great location
an ayce sushi in east markham
seem too good to be true
unfortunately -PRON- be
the food here fail to meet -PRON- already low expectation
the sushi rice be mushy and over cook sashimi be still partially freeze and cut in to odd shape
-PRON- be sure -PRON- be the end piece that usually get turn into roll tempura be over batter dense and soggy
consider -PRON- be charge about the same as other significantly good ayce sushi place -PRON- be very disappointed
menu selection be a little odd -PRON- have a large selection of roll but a poor selection of everything else
so good if -PRON- like roll bad if -PRON- like everything else
-PRON- wish -PRON- have good thing to say about the food -PRON- want this place to do well as -PRON- be close to home
the waiter be amazingly friendly and personable
-PRON- love support small local business
but unfortunately this be one -PRON- can not get behind
-PRON- must admit that -PRON- have never be to the frick cafe or greenhouse or whatev the surround building be which be something -PRON- should remedy sometime in the future
however this review be for first fridays
the frick which take over the ground of 7227 reynolds street for just a couple friday night each summer
these couple friday night have become one of -PRON- favorite pittsburgh tradition
for summer 2014 there be three concert happen at the frick meeting of important people friday june 6 2014 7:00 p.m. jerry grcevich tamburitza orchestra
friday august 1 2014 7:00 p.m. sean jones quartet
friday september 5 2014 7:00 p.m.
sadly -PRON- have already miss the first concert on june 6th but still have time to check out the other two
though -PRON- start at 7 p.m. -PRON- recommend arrive earlier or at least have some people in -PRON- group arrive earlier to save some space for everyone
also make sure to have $ 5 or more on hand to give at the entrance for the recommend donation
even though the music be important thank to meeting of important people for put on a great show on friday night -PRON- think that friend and food really make this event
-PRON- husband and -PRON- meet 8 friend and have a great time chat and laugh and catch up on life
this be the sort of concert that -PRON- be ok to talk through
then the food -PRON- can not forget the food
-PRON- group have fruit and cheese and wine and spring roll and mac cheese and dessert and on and on
have an elaborate picnic style dinner in a beautiful space while listen to music just feel like such a magical movie moment
-PRON- be already count down the day to the august concert
very shocking experience
last night -PRON- go to there with -PRON- sister
-PRON- sit at out door din area
-PRON- order a grill chicken penne which have some fresh vegetable on top ~ when the food come up there be a lady bug run inside out on that salad on top
so -PRON- ask the waitress come to change -PRON-
the service be very nice and super sorrowful
even manage come by and apology and promise to make up a brand new one
surprisingly what come up be the same penne and same vege
but mixed fry with the salad on top and reheat so u think -PRON- be different
the bread get all black out becoz -PRON- just heat up same thing again
-PRON- do not make a new one -PRON- be remake and lie
-PRON- do not want to point that out last night
not only becoz -PRON- sister do not notice
the but also the calm and peace atmosphere
-PRON- know that if the manager over there allow -PRON- chief to do such thing -PRON- would not admit what -PRON- have do
truly disappointed
and how could people who make food have such a bad manner
buy the 12 $ the work not only a lot of soap be leave on the car after the wash
do not expect to have -PRON- rear end of -PRON- car wash
expect 50 of the dirt to stay on the car
the spot free rinse be not really spot free
so -PRON- will see spot of water unless -PRON- towel -PRON-
somebody write -PRON- good than the laser wash and that be why -PRON- go but that person surely be delusional
laser wash have 100 good quality than this wash for the same price
alvie 's be a solid lunch place food wise offer a pretty diverse diner style menu
the baked mac and cheese be great and the lunch omelet be huge
-PRON- have hear good thing about the matzo ball soup but have not yet try -PRON- -PRON-
apparently -PRON- once have but no longer officially serve chocolate phosphate
service be friendly although a bit slow during the lunching hour
if -PRON- be in a hurry -PRON- would probably be good off elsewhere
the decor well don't go to alvie 's for the decor
-PRON- like the food but the service need some work
today -PRON- decide that -PRON- turkey sandwich would be good on white bread instead of sourdough bread although -PRON- never mention anything to -PRON-
-PRON- mess up the order that be right before -PRON- as well
not impressed
this be -PRON- and -PRON- wife 's first time to the gourmet taco shop
-PRON- absolutely love -PRON-
great salsa bar good horchata ever and classic take on mexican food
definitely recommend this place
these be the one of the good bagle -PRON- have taste
-PRON- have read some review and do not know what some of these people be talk about
-PRON- live in brooklyn and have have bad bagle in brooklyn these be be good then some of the bagle -PRON- have have in brooklyn
wake up people
these be great
and -PRON- know i be from brooklyn and a new yorker not like some of -PRON- that do not know what good bagle or food taste like
coffee good great staff all baked and fresh just what a new yorker want -PRON- know -PRON- have the good bagle and pizza in the world
probably -PRON- favorite non uptown place to hang if the weather be nice
good patio in charlotte imo
food be well bar food mostly but still great
big fan of the fry pickle
patio be full of love seat high pub table couch etc
there be also a fireplace maybe two and tv 's mount all around the patio to view effortlessly
honestly the only reason -PRON- do not slide -PRON- up to a 5 star review be because of the parking
ugh
never enough spot and -PRON- may end up have to park a block down etc
not a big deal but an inconvenience none the less
note
-PRON- can sometimes catch a local celebrity here also
-PRON- late sighting be bill deihl lawyer for george shin for those that be here back in the day and also vote at one time one of charlotte 's 10 scary people
guy seem nice to -PRON-
lol
good del taco
-PRON- have have in vegas
each time -PRON- go -PRON- be always fresh and the burrito and taco be fat
awesome chili cheese fry as well
delicious food fast drive thru service and -PRON- order be right
what more could -PRON- want in a fast food place
go here today very very small place -PRON- be not able to handle a crowd so go during slow time
seat be outside with only 6 seat inside and very very crammed in
the homemade cookie be not super sweet and very good
have a legend trail and double chocolate chunk
-PRON- have breakfast as well as lunch
-PRON- bread be homemade with out all the preservative and contain the simple ingredient flour egg yeast sugar water no soy and no junk
-PRON- have a party of 5 the patio outside should be a little big as -PRON- be hard to move around when -PRON- get crowd like today
the 7 which be a veggie sandwich be very good and big a whole sandwich can feed two people come with a pickle
the egg and bacon sandwich be also very good and come with strawberry
nice place to stop for a quick bite
the chair be uncomfortable and the space be very crammed once -PRON- get hot outside not sure where people will go as -PRON- have limit table inside
pretty good food and great bread but need more seating option to enjoy the food
-PRON- want to have an apex trigger and some fiber optic sight instal on -PRON- m&p shield
other pistol smith around town be give -PRON- 10 15 day estimate wwg do -PRON- the same day
this be not a rush job -PRON- be there early in the morning
and -PRON- take a few hour
-PRON- take -PRON- time with the install and test fire two full mag
the smith that do the install even come out and chat for a few minute after
-PRON- take -PRON- out to the desert the next day and run 500 fmj round through -PRON-
not one malfunction and -PRON- run exactly how -PRON- be hop -PRON- would
-PRON- be very satisfied with both the upgrade and the install
-PRON- be there on a slow day -PRON- will not always expect such a quick turn around but there be other reason for the 5 star charles be the man
-PRON- be incredibly knowledgable yet completely approachable and friendly
the price be very fair and the selection of firearm accessory and ammo be quality
the place be clean and do not feel like a tourist gun store
look for a great place to hang out while -PRON- family go shopping or gambling in vegas
todd english p.u.b. be the place
widest the selection of beer and a good selection of food make -PRON- a great place
service be quick and attentive too
will be back
-PRON- make a bad decision in food choice and take two bite of -PRON- and push -PRON- to the side
-PRON- waitress first ask -PRON- if -PRON- want -PRON- to make -PRON- something else -PRON- simply reply no thank -PRON-
without mention -PRON- -PRON- just take -PRON- off of -PRON- check
that earn -PRON- five star
-PRON- will be back to try other food that night be just poor judgement on -PRON- part with -PRON- food choice
love place with good customer service
-PRON- go to this restaurant expect tiny plate of food and to go home hungry thank to a google review
however that be not the case at all
-PRON- be definitely not super sized portion but after bread a side of spinach and -PRON- baked egg entree -PRON- be too full for dessert
the food be artistically put together
though instead of just visual appeal which -PRON- have
the flavor be complex and complement each other
the only thing that seem a bit off be the very casual nature of the server the music young indie rock and the fact that -PRON- have run out of many thing that -PRON- order and be later tell -PRON- could not have
-PRON- be luckily lay back enough for none of that to have bother -PRON-
all in all a wonderful experience with great food in a nice environment
wir waren hi zum abendessen das restaurant liegt in einer der besseren wohngegenden stuttgart`s und entsprechend kultiviert und angenehm ist dort auch das publikum
die einrichtung ist urig und geschmackvoll die terrasse -PRON- be sommer ist traumhaft
bei schönem wetter speziell be wochenende unbedingt reservieren
der service wahr herzlich und zuvorkommend
viele gäste werden vom chef per handschlag oder gar umarmung begrüßt viele stammkunden sind schon mal ein gute zeichen
bestellt haben wir das geschmorte lamm und eine gemischte platte deren
namen ich nicht mehr weiß gyros lamm schweinemedaillons
dazu ein guter roter hauswein
das essen kam schnell und war wohlschmeckend ich würde es al gut aber nicht sehr gut einstufen
das zaziki könnte mehr bum haben das geschmorte
lamm war zart aber die soße hätte intensiver sein können
es ist aber jammern auf hohem niveau für service\/ambiente sind 4 sterne sicher angemessen essen 3 4 sterne
this be the bad place -PRON- have ever stay at
-PRON- be there for 10 day
not once do anyone come to even empty
the trash never mind change the sheet or clean
-PRON- have to leave -PRON- trash bag outside -PRON- door and if -PRON- want to have clean sheet -PRON- could go down to the so call front desk and get -PRON- for $ 4.99 and change -PRON- -PRON-
speak of do thing -PRON-
when -PRON- call down to ask why there be no dish or pot and pan in the unit -PRON- be tell -PRON- would have to go down to the front desk and get -PRON-
-PRON- be in a fairly large box that -PRON- have to bring up -PRON-
again this be an extended stay place should not this stuff already be in in the pint size not fully equip at advertised kitchen
the sheet be scratchy and the tv barely work
not to mention for an extended stay no hair dryer
seriously what hotel do not provide hair dryer anymore
-PRON- may have have wifi but honestly -PRON- do not know as no one tell -PRON- anything about wifi or anything else for that matter when -PRON- check in
the woman at the front desk be not helpful at all and just plain rude
also -PRON- be very very loud
there be a lot of noise from the nearby highway but also from inside the hotel
-PRON- hear door slam and some very loud bump or something
-PRON- be actually very hard to sleep
-PRON- really could go on and on
-PRON- be horrible
-PRON- never not leave something for the maid
but -PRON- be so pissed off
-PRON- leave nothing
not one penny
do not stay here
-PRON- have accidentally buy several item here that -PRON- realize when -PRON- get home that -PRON- be out of date
-PRON- usually check sell by date but sometimes when -PRON- be in a hurry -PRON- miss something
usually -PRON- would not be a problem at any other store
-PRON- should not fall on the customer anyway to be responsible for make sure -PRON- buy good food -PRON- should be the responsibility of the store to make sure -PRON- be sell the customer good food
the worker also mostly seem like -PRON- wish -PRON- be somewhere else
the store be hard to navigate as well -PRON- wonder if -PRON- put the turnstile in to reduce theft maybe
-PRON- be kind of a pain
-PRON- recently return from a trip to china to find that a great beautifully authentic chinese restaurant have pop up right in -PRON- home town
-PRON- love practice -PRON- chinese with the owner who clearly have a passion for help americans experience one of the good part of chinese culture- the amazing food
this be the real thing right out of sichuan- nothing like the americanized version -PRON- normally get in in the charlotte area
please everyone go here
get a real taste of china
-PRON- be in the do not call list for age
but this company still call -PRON- out of the blue
-PRON- understand that -PRON- be try to get -PRON- name know
but the do not call list be there for a purpose
-PRON- should not call people who be in the do not call list
outstanding food good ambiance attentive waitstaff
what be not to love
go for the tasting menu small portion of all of -PRON- appetizer entree and dessert
-PRON- be a hard call otherwise to pick the good dish and the tasting menu 's ridiculously cheap
-PRON- stop in to try the advertise $ 20 special
-PRON- upsold -PRON- to $ 28 for an add 30 minute ion bath which be clearly hokem
the massage be perfunctory the therapist just go through the motion of a very set routine
the real shocker be when -PRON- give -PRON- $ 40 and ask for $ 5 back in change a 25 tip
-PRON- flat out refuse to give any change
-PRON- type 40 into the calculator subtract 28 point at the 12 and then point at -PRON-
when -PRON- say no 7 for -PRON- 5 for -PRON- -PRON- shake -PRON- head
hahaha -PRON- just walk out
enjoy that $ 5 -PRON- will never see another penny from -PRON-
not recommend
this be absolutely the bad dining experience -PRON- have have in a long time
-PRON- be pray -PRON- do not all get sick
where to begin
-PRON- be out of pull pork at a bbq restaurant
ham
turkey sausage
bbq bean
pickles silverware
the food -PRON- do receive be cold
the place be dirty and disgusting
the sauce station have not be clean in who know how long
wrapper all over the floor
the bathroom be bad than most gas station
the worker could not care less that the place be a wreck
-PRON- wish -PRON- could give zero star
do not go to this restaurant
please god do not let -PRON- all get sick tonight

edit to add
-PRON- be a long time yelp reader but never post just not -PRON- thing
-PRON- actually create an account tonight because this be so bad
-PRON- have a duty to warn people
-PRON- should have just leave
why oh why do not -PRON-
oh and the bathroom also smell of cigarette smoke
and previous reviewer be right on about the sink not work etc
what a dump
-PRON- favorite place for great seafood
-PRON- husband and -PRON- share a shrimp cocktail which have jumbo shrimp with a wonderful texture and great cocktail sauce with fresh horseradish
crawfish platter in a medium size be too much for -PRON- to finish
blackened catfish be perfectly cook
hubby enjoy bread pudding for dessert
all dessert be huge
price be high but worth -PRON- for quality
service also great
the down side of this place be the noise level
but for the noise -PRON- would have rat 5 star
old school burger and fry joint with some old school greek guy behind the grill
would love to go back and try some old school souvlaki
update
reduce from a 5-star to a 4-star since -PRON- only accept cash however there be an atm machine inside
in today 's somewhat advanced society there should be more option in term of payment available for customer other than cash
that be -PRON- honest opinion
everytime -PRON- come here -PRON- instantly regret -PRON- decision
-PRON- manage to screw up the simple of order
the late be -PRON- wife order a sandwich with a soup as -PRON- side
the waiter bring -PRON- on the same plate and spill all the liquid on the sandwich make -PRON- soggy and gross
-PRON- order an egg benedict and -PRON- order the egg medium soft
-PRON- come so well do that -PRON- be practically chicken
-PRON- do not understand how this franchise be still in business
the food be a lot good when -PRON- try to mirror -PRON- as a jewish style deli
just give up
meh
2nd time dining at this location
the first be back in july and -PRON- be fine
tonight be a little disappointing
-PRON- get the moo shu pork and -PRON- look a bit old and really watery
there look to be about 3 pound of the stuff
not much flavor
but -PRON- eat -PRON- with 2 of the pancake and call -PRON-
-PRON- pick through the bowl and take home the rest of the pork
but -PRON- will probably end up toss -PRON-
the sesame chicken be actually really good
so -PRON- would stick with that or some fry rice
-PRON- will never come back to this place
-PRON- know that feeling that -PRON- be be watch
like -PRON- be go to steal something
this be the way the people here make -PRON- feel
if -PRON- do not eat every piece of sushi and -PRON- pay for all -PRON- can eat
-PRON- will charge -PRON- the all -PRON- can eat price and charge -PRON- for the roll
-PRON- literally do not eat 1 piece and the lady give -PRON- a hard time
seriously the sushi police
go down the street to sushi loca
-PRON- can thank -PRON- later
excellent food and service
the banana pudding be great
-PRON- main entree be the steak burger which be excellent as well
-PRON- have to wait about 25 minute for -PRON- seat but -PRON- be worth -PRON-
-PRON- recently go to liberty market with -PRON- girlfriend
-PRON- want to take -PRON- to a breakfast place -PRON- have never be to before and be very impressed
-PRON- stand in line and wonder how -PRON- be go to get a table in the restaurant since -PRON- be so packed
saturday around 10 a.m.
one of the employee hand -PRON- a menu and ask if -PRON- be -PRON- first time there
-PRON- say yes
-PRON- tell -PRON- how the system work and give -PRON- a card with a number on -PRON- and tell -PRON- -PRON- would get -PRON- a table a place a duplicate card with -PRON- number on -PRON-
right
before -PRON- order -PRON- food -PRON- table be ready
-PRON- order the american standard since -PRON- want a classic breakfast meal
-PRON- order the gravy since -PRON- come with a biscuit
-PRON- also order a large iced latte
most of the time -PRON- be hesitant to order a latte at a restaurant because -PRON- be such a coffee snob but the latte be quite good -PRON- could taste the espresso without feel like -PRON- have a glass of milk with a splash of espresso
there be not much bitterness to the espresso and be smooth and flavorful
the food be even good than the coffee
breakfast be one of -PRON- favorite meal
when -PRON- food be bring to -PRON- -PRON- ask for some ketchup for -PRON- potato but as soon as -PRON- try -PRON-
-PRON- do not even use any ketchup since the be so delicious
-PRON- way -PRON- come
-PRON- have a great experience with this restaurant and will be recommend -PRON- to anyone look for a place to get some great food
very slow service
have three people bring the food but -PRON- the follow up or service after that
no drink refill wait 10.minute between boxing leftover a d get the check
very disappointing experience in black friday
hostess be stone out of -PRON- mind
food be bring out an hour after order and be present cold to the touch
the signature soup have actually film over -PRON- have become so cold
cook deliver food do not seem to care about what -PRON- be provide
the inevitable discussion with management reveal an overwhelmed person who be probably afraid to say anything to the cook
the only person in the restaurant that care be the waitress
-PRON- would not go back
just go there for dinner
-PRON- be pretty busy and be definitely nice inside
-PRON- be pretty put off by all the bad review on here
but -PRON- think -PRON- be pretty good
-PRON- definitely be go for southern food style and since -PRON- have never be to the south -PRON- do not know if -PRON- be authentic or not but flavor be good
lot of fry food
service be decent
-PRON- really love the live piano music that be very nice
-PRON- would probably come here again
steam hotpot be popular in hong kong but not very common in toronto
-PRON- think this be the first restaurant to offer this style of cooking which be essentially a large steamer at -PRON- table where everything be cook
-PRON- like -PRON- because -PRON- be a very healthy way of cooking
most of the item be fresh seafood and -PRON- select a congee or broth base that sit at the bottom and absorb all the juice from the seafood
-PRON- offer a number of set combo but -PRON- decide to order individual item that -PRON- want to eat
-PRON- get alaskan crab vancouver jumbo clams some veggie like corn the congee base and some angus beef skewer
the server choose the crab for -PRON- which be huge
-PRON- be really good and fresh but probably way more crab than -PRON- want to eat in one sitting
the clam be also really good and -PRON- be funny watch -PRON- slowly open in the glass steamer as -PRON- cook
the angus beef be very mediocre
so -PRON- be glad -PRON- do not order that many skewer
the overall experience be good as -PRON- get a designate server who cook all the food for -PRON- and the steamer actually beep when each food be do cook for -PRON- to come over and serve -PRON-
all that be say this place be expensive and to be honest -PRON- be not sure if -PRON- be worth -PRON-
-PRON- meal be great but at $ 200 + per person -PRON- would expect -PRON- to be
definitely not a place for -PRON- average everyday dinner but more of a splurge
music be awesome
drink be overprice enough that -PRON- give this place a two
maybe that be par for scottsdale
but -PRON- do not think 18 dollar for a captain and coke and
a double red stag and coke be acceptable
-PRON- try to stop in here to get one soft serve vanilla dish and one chocolate dish
-PRON- be out of chocolate soft serve
dairy queen only serve two flavor of ice cream so this be fairly unacceptable
there be no sign or indication
so -PRON- wait in line for fifteen minute to find this out
the inside have a decent size freezer case and seat and the parking lot be large
this place be amazing
-PRON- have see a lot of people get tattoo removal that end up with a bad result than the original tattoo -PRON- go in with i.e scar blotchy skin or barely any ink removal after many session etc
so -PRON- really do -PRON- research when look for a place to have -PRON- tattoo remove
-PRON- have more than happy with -PRON- result
april be -PRON- laser technician
-PRON- be the good
very nice professional and -PRON- knowledge of removal be top notch
-PRON- be a little nervous at first
but -PRON- quickly set -PRON- nerve at ease and the whole process be over quickly and be not nearly as hard as -PRON- think -PRON- would be
-PRON- totally recommend ask for april if -PRON- go in
after only one service -PRON- have already see great result
and -PRON- have a blue tattoo which be one of the hard color to work on
this place give a+ service
can not wait to see the progress of -PRON- next couple session
horrible experience here
-PRON- wait over 45 minute for -PRON- apt to start
not one person check on -PRON-
-PRON- eventually find a manager on -PRON- own and walk out
do not recommend this salon

drink some 40 with the punk in the parking lot usually good and cheap than see the band inside
otherwise nothing to write home about except the excellent firework show provide after the dback play
tiny gelato place on parliament but totally worth a visit
-PRON- serve non dairy gelato great for the lactose intolerant folk make from coconut
actual coconut that -PRON- can see in the pack as -PRON- walk in
-PRON- be very tasty and the non coconut flavour such as chocolate do not taste like coconut at all
-PRON- have try the lemon and coconut two flavour a serving and chocolate and vanilla bean
all be great
-PRON- also taste the strawberry flavour which be nice but mild and sweet
-PRON- personally prefer a more sour strawberry gelato
in any case service be great
love this bar
do -PRON- know -PRON- be build one up at desert ridge
just drive by today and see the sign and a building be work on
amazing so fun and a great spot for -PRON-

food be fun service be good great spot to watch game and -PRON- usually have some good drink special so -PRON- be not about to break the bank when go there
still amazing although -PRON- change -PRON- menu drastically
still -PRON- can not go wrong with -PRON- udon or raman and the rest of the short menu be amazing
this be authentic japanese cuisine just like what -PRON- would have in tokyo
for the reviewer that give this place a low rating get over yourself and learn about authentic japanese cuisine
go here over christmas with -PRON- family -PRON- go to a nice restaurant as a christmas gift to each other last year be canoe so amuse have some big shoe to fill
amuse be tuck just off queen street and be actually a house when -PRON- arrive -PRON- be usher into a room towards the back what may have be a dining room originally
while amuse be not a large place -PRON- not crowd with table
there be only two other table in the room another 4-seater and one 2-seater
-PRON- have to say the cozy nature of amuse and the ambiance be fantastic for a very nice quiet family dinner out
from where -PRON- sit -PRON- be able to see right into the kitchen and watch the chef and sous chef create -PRON- meal
-PRON- start with the scallop with roasted cauliflower and -PRON- be to die for
-PRON- do not think -PRON- have ever have scallop that taste that delicious
and -PRON- be a tad skeptical about the flavor pairing when -PRON- order -PRON-
from the time -PRON- be put in front of -PRON- to the time -PRON- finish -PRON- savor every single bite
absolutely wonderful starting note to -PRON- meal
-PRON- choose the crispy skin boneless cornish hen as -PRON- main and be rather pleased overall
the portion be perfect this be not the kind of restaurant that -PRON- would come to simply for a main the hen be perfect and the grill vegetable lasagna be a wonderful side
the rapini be a tad too bitter for the dish which be well balance but aside from that -PRON- have no complaint
for dessert -PRON- have the sticky toffee walnut cake which be on par with the rest of the meal
overall the dessert be the least impressive part of the meal but -PRON- be well execute and a rather appropriate ending to a very decadent but not overly rich meal
-PRON- would absolutely recommend amuse for a special occasion out or for a night where -PRON- want to have wonderful food and a very nice atmosphere to relax have a drink and eat a nice meal in
-PRON- can not go wrong with the gem in the beach
one of the good coffee place ever the expresso be so amazing

today the price be hype up
-PRON- order the same gluten and a supreme
this time the pizza be awful

-PRON- show -PRON- a picture on pinterest and -PRON- create the look with no hesitation
before -PRON- meet elaine -PRON- be nervous about what to expect
little do -PRON- know -PRON- be in great hand
-PRON- recommend pampered brides 100 percent
well -PRON- be sure astonish to find a great rib joint in a mall
the sampler be more than enough for two people everything be good but especially the chicken
-PRON- like most bbq but shane 's remind -PRON- that the stuff -PRON- have up -PRON- way seattle be pretty lame
shane be do a classic southern style bbq which be complex and spicy
like another of the reviewer -PRON- think the green be a little on the sweet side
the staff do a great job of get the order out quickly and keep the place clean and appealing
if -PRON- live in the phoenix area -PRON- would be regular
-PRON- husband and -PRON- decide to try this place -PRON- have read some review and hear some thing and think -PRON- be time to try
-PRON- be greet warmly at the door and the menu be explain
two side argentinian and peruvian

-PRON- snack on -PRON- while wait

one really hot one slight less hot ketchup and one for the salad
-PRON- then be tempt by the carmel crepe yummy goodness serve warm cover with powdered sugar
-PRON- be wonderful
overall a good meal light not too heavy the price be reasonable and the atmosphere pleasant
-PRON- think -PRON- would deserve a revisit
so last night -PRON- regular game night be cancel so -PRON- go to the new castle boardgame cafe with -PRON- group
-PRON- be a nice venue
-PRON- opt to try one of -PRON- waffle which be very nice
the tea be okay but the strainer let a few leaf into -PRON-
game wise -PRON- play that firefighter game which be fun until the building fall down around -PRON-
-PRON- get in a couple game of tsuro a game of smash up
-PRON- be a nice venue and -PRON- probably should have grab one of the couch table
the acoustic of the place be unforgiv if someone be play jenga
the fee rate two fiddy an hour instead of snake flat $ 5 be not too bad and -PRON- selection be okay
-PRON- be get a great location right on spadina
-PRON- be a nice addition to the board game cafe ecosystem in toronto
-PRON- get take out chicken curry and a rice noodle dish very similar to pad thai
the curry be more like what would be consider malay curry at mint cafe which be definitely fine with -PRON-
-PRON- think the food be good than average
-PRON- have have app and entree there
the heat level be inconsistent -PRON- have have blisteringly hot and -PRON- have have pretty tame heat on the same dish on different occasion
the service be good the decor be cool
-PRON- be glad to see the irish bar and middle eastern food stranglehold on w. 25th be break
-PRON- food be amazing
-PRON- want to savor every taste on -PRON- taste bud
-PRON- love the foie gra creme brulee and the wagyu beef tartare
-PRON- could have order more and eaten these as the meal
-PRON- duck dish be by far the good
the flavor be just perfect
braised veal shank probably give the most food and oh soo good
the scallop be good but -PRON- do not think -PRON- be as amazing as the first two dish describe
-PRON- husband say the braise short rib be not -PRON- favorite
decent food for an okay price enjoy -PRON- lucy 's mac cheese which be very delicious but do not have the panko crust advertise in the menu
look more like a pasta cabonara than a baked cheese dish but still yummy
-PRON- go with a group and everyone seem to enjoy -PRON- meal especially the meatball marinara panini which win rave review from -PRON- friend chewy baguette chunky marinara sauce and moist meatball
need some time to mature
quite a few of the store be empty some of the business do not seem very well stock or staffed
the restroom be nice though clean anyway
if -PRON- happen to be in the area again maybe -PRON- will stop by and see how -PRON- be go
but otherwise nothing here to make -PRON- want to drive across town to visit
good fajitas in vegas and now -PRON- find out -PRON- be close november 7 for remodel of the monte carlo
so if -PRON- here for sema make sure -PRON- come by and see jasmin -PRON- be the good
this be -PRON- favourite sushi place in the beach -PRON- a little on the pricy side but -PRON- be absolutely worth -PRON-
-PRON- will find the quality of the appetizer be surpriz the gyoza be melty and overstuff with meat
-PRON- usually do not pay attention to appetizer at sushi -PRON- mind be always set on get to the fresh fish asap
but -PRON- think -PRON- will find -PRON- enjoy the salad soup and dumpling here just as much as the sashimi -PRON-
the roll be big -PRON- be serious about that
between two people -PRON- could not eat more than 2 roll the muskoka and kamikaze roll get a big thumb up from -PRON-
spicy fresh fish the roll be so big -PRON- want to take two bite but -PRON- know how disastrous and messy that can be
do not do -PRON-
if -PRON- be in the beach this be -PRON- good bet for sushi if there be a line up wait
-PRON- worth -PRON-
this place do what -PRON- be suppose to do feed people decent breakfast and lunch food
-PRON- do that marvelously
-PRON- be a nice place and be a quaint restaurant
-PRON- get the french toast
-PRON- be solid
-PRON- really like this place
warning there be two ah so restaurant within a few mile of each other
-PRON- actually have reservation at the other ah so but by the time -PRON- get park into this place and realize that -PRON- be at the wrong place -PRON- stay
-PRON- only have to wait 5 10 minute to sit at the cooking table
-PRON- chef be entertaining and the food be delicious
-PRON- be pleasantly surprised to find that -PRON- have a $ 5 sake bomb special that include a large container of sake and a huge sapporo beer enough for four sake bomb
-PRON- experience as a whole be great -PRON- would go back
how can -PRON- go wrong with this place
amazing flavor from the typical to the out of the box creation
something new to try every time
the owner be super nice and helpful always ready to give -PRON- as many sample as possible
try -PRON- out a gem in vegas
-PRON- have be here numerous time
food 's great and the wait staff have always be good
-PRON- recommend get one of the burger -PRON- be all good and the crab cake
-PRON- must admit that when -PRON- first hear -PRON- date be take -PRON- here -PRON- be disappointed because the name have -PRON- trick into think -PRON- be go to some strange mixture between a jazz bar and coffee lounge
however do not be like -PRON- and let the strange name fool -PRON- restaurant bazz java jazz be not a cafe and -PRON- do not play any jazz music
bazz java jazz be actually a contemporary french restaurant that serve delicate and beautiful dish worthy of praise
despite -PRON- quirky name this restaurant be nothing but strange -PRON- be intimate romantic warm and sophisticated
-PRON- would recommend this place an ideal spot for a special date
the music be play very low the light be soft and the service be professional and personable
the restaurant be small but tastefully decorate
-PRON- be one of the few modern french place that still believe in dressing table in white linen and -PRON- be all for table cloth on special occasion
in fact the entire restaurant give the feeling that -PRON- be din in a good friend 's home which make the ambiance very warm cozy and invite
as for the food -PRON- be simply mouthwater
the menu list be refine and contemporary serve up french fare that show finesse okay enough with the alliteration
the presentation be nice as well and do -PRON- mention that -PRON- be bring -PRON- own wine
definitely make a reservation here if -PRON- be in the south shore and if -PRON- want to try an unexpected gem of a restaurant
-PRON- love this place and -PRON- can not wait to go back with -PRON- love one
terrible service
wait 40 minute just for water to be serve
-PRON- soup be serve and -PRON- still have no water
-PRON- constantly ask but -PRON- never bring any water out to -PRON- table even after -PRON- entrées arrive
-PRON- receive water after an hour when -PRON- be eat -PRON- main course
when -PRON- get -PRON- water -PRON- do no refill -PRON- water until -PRON- be about to leave
server have terrible attitude from the start
not friendly
the food be cold by the time -PRON- reach -PRON- table
very oily
rice be hard
-PRON- be also out of many food choice such as soy chicken clam shrimp and dessert
the only dessert -PRON- have available be sesame ball
unfortunately -PRON- husband and -PRON- be not very impressed with this place
-PRON- table be great and -PRON- be sit in front of the large window with a pretty view of the pool and the strip
-PRON- food be the issue here
first off the only beer -PRON- have be in bottle which be a bit ridiculous for a hotel restaurant
-PRON- order the buffalo cauliflower which be soggy cauliflower with buffalo sauce on -PRON-
-PRON- husband want the tater tots which again be soggy but with cheese on -PRON-
for -PRON- entree -PRON- split the crab cake burger
maybe -PRON- should have just get a regular burger but the crab cake be super salty and really just not tasty
-PRON- live so close to the m but -PRON- will definitely not be return to this burger joint

well -PRON- definitely will not be receive -PRON- business ever again
-PRON- be such a shame that -PRON- book a ticket for this event unfortunately be not able to see the show
due to the failure to update the website -PRON- nephew
-PRON- miss the show because -PRON- arrive at 440 instead of 430 which what the mirage employee say suppose to be

-PRON- really a what a izakaya feel like
the food be truly fantastic and the service be professional as well
-PRON- order deep fry chicken knee cheese oyster which -PRON- like the most udon and unagi rice
-PRON- would strongly recommend cheese oyster which taste amazingly delicious
for the next time -PRON- would order more side food because after around 1 hour -PRON- feel hungry again
anyway this be the place -PRON- can not miss and -PRON- want to go more than once after -PRON- try the food there
-PRON- have eat here about 8 time and -PRON- always have great buger here
-PRON- have never have a real bad experence here only thing -PRON- can point
to be -PRON- wife find a long grey hair in -PRON- food from an old lady who work there but other than that great palce to eat
-PRON- need to find a way to clean some of the table in the back room -PRON- finger stick to -PRON- a little bit just make sure to keep -PRON- food on -PRON- plate
-PRON- also offer other type of buger such as buffalo turkey elk fish etc so there be a lot to type and come back to test out
-PRON- have never be brave enough to try one of the other burger even though -PRON- hear -PRON- be really good look for a review in the future
-PRON- also love the milk shake -PRON- serve here strawberry be the good
not only do -PRON- fill up -PRON- glass but -PRON- give -PRON- the rest in what -PRON- use to blend -PRON-
-PRON- have not try this steak house for year

firstly the hostess lead -PRON- to the bad table in the place which be half empty
good try chris but no luck
-PRON- ask to be move into the light
done
-PRON- order -PRON- classic fix price
most outstanding be the salad starter
least outstanding everything else
steaks a bit tough at medium rare
french fry outrageously overprice and like from the supermarket frozen food freezer
the shrimp part of the turf and surf come unheated and flimsy
desert be ok if -PRON- be still into cheesecake in the 21st century
service be spotty
-PRON- be dress to the nine
but across from -PRON- be a crowd in t shirt
there go the atomsphere
-PRON- will not return

-PRON- next appointment be in four week

this be a great restaurant if -PRON- look for a well make pizza
the margherita pizza -PRON- make have be one of the good -PRON- have have
the pasta dish be up to par but just do not quite have that wow to -PRON-
the taste be good but -PRON- may need to season -PRON- -PRON- free as if the pasta could use a little work
the ambience be fantastic
-PRON- walk in and -PRON- get that dinner by a candle feel back in room under the star
the staff be well train the can be a bit overwhelmed on busy night so expect a little wait time before -PRON- get serve overall 4 star for the excellent pizza the stunning ambience and the well train staff
come with some business colleague
be a great lunch place that have a casual and invite environment that encourage conversation
interesting choice of food portion nicely for a substantive but not overwhelming meal
for self choose to go with two appetizer and have the roasted tomato soup with the lamb neck croquette which make for an interesting and delicious combination
colleagues try different plate and all leave pleased
recommend as a great and interesting lunch place and likely dinner get together with friend
-PRON- stop by late at night work in the area
this place be awesome
at first glance -PRON- wonder how -PRON- can handle so many people large crowd and be so busy
-PRON- be awesome
-PRON- have be there when -PRON- be slow and when -PRON- be slam on a weekend
-PRON- give -PRON- very consistent service
food be awesome quality of sushi be great the sushi bar take great pride in -PRON- work
would highly recommend

challenge this restaurant by find -PRON- favorite authentic italian dish
-PRON- advice get the special
this place be great for amazing food for a fair price
every reviewer have comment on how well organize the store be
duhhhhh
if this place be not organize -PRON- do not brave the madness of the grand opening but have a little time to kill after shlepp to town square for -PRON- apple genius bar appointment so -PRON- dare the container store to wow -PRON-
-PRON- do
and -PRON- do not
yes -PRON- have lot of stuff
-PRON- do not suffer the crowd of the opening weekend in fact the store be fairly empty so -PRON- find -PRON- bright airy and fairly spacious
but when -PRON- first come to vegas -PRON- have no trouble fill up all those empty cabinet in the trophy kitchen
so -PRON- do not need more stuff
what -PRON- do need desperately be an extra long hook to loop over -PRON- very tall shower door
so -PRON- do not have to run naked wet and shiver to get to the towel in the oh so thoughtfully design bathroom
the container store do not have it
the selection of thing that -PRON- do have be pretty big but the price be high
-PRON- will probably return a if -PRON- happen to be at town square for some other reason or b if -PRON- need something special and verify online then by phone that -PRON- be carry by -PRON- and be in stock
otherwise -PRON- will not be make a special trip
instead -PRON- will stick with -PRON- old standby bed bath and beyond where -PRON- can save 20 on every single item with -PRON- never end supply of coupon
service be friendly and quick
but the salad if -PRON- can call -PRON- that be so poor
cut up ice berg lettuce with ranch fry chicken and tomato
what be -PRON- a picky 4-year old kid
crap american fast food style
good beer and great food
for beer -PRON- usually just stick to bumble berry which be great
-PRON- try something different each time when -PRON- eat here and -PRON- be so good every time
fat head be a must if -PRON- have never be
-PRON- like come here mostly to get -PRON- delicious sushi
-PRON- will warn that this place be constantly busy
-PRON- always do self check out because the other register get long all the time
finding parking be a nightmare year around because the entire nation must shop here
but -PRON- have great affordable price and -PRON- be clean compare to other fry 's location near -PRON-
in fact -PRON- drive past 2 other location to make -PRON- to this one
the only thing that annoy -PRON- be one time -PRON- forget -PRON- id card and -PRON- refuse to sell -PRON- alcohol
-PRON- be 30 and start to get white hair on -PRON- head and -PRON- honestly turn -PRON- away
there be no way on this planet that -PRON- look under the age of 21
-PRON- be rare -PRON- ever need to pull -PRON- id out because most of the worker can clearly tell -PRON- be over 21
that one worker cause -PRON- to not return for month but luckily -PRON- love -PRON- sushi so much -PRON- have return just for that
-PRON- husband and -PRON- stop in on a friday night while look for a spot close to summerlin
the interior be clean and simple and the owner be very very friendly but man be this some heavy heavy food
-PRON- order the east coast dog which have pastrami and sauerkraut the angry burger which have spicy bugolgi and euro fry
-PRON- favorite be definitely the angry burger
-PRON- have the least amount of mayo on -PRON- and -PRON- be juicy
that have to be some fatty 80\/20 or something
the spicy bugolgi be a bomb combo but because of all the juice -PRON- get soggy pretty fast so eat up
the east coast dog be -PRON- husband 's choice
-PRON- really want to try the bahn mi but -PRON- husband hat bahn mis
the hot dog -PRON- be quality for sure and huge
-PRON- shovel food in -PRON- face like there be no tomorrow but -PRON- do not think -PRON- could eat more than 2 of those bad boy when -PRON- can do about 4 standard hot dog
the east coast dog be good but nothing special
-PRON- be sure the asian fusion dog would have have more interesting flavor
lastly the euro fry
-PRON- would have to agree with the other reviewer on the lack of topping on these
there be obviously a lot of garlic mayo but that pork belly be a little skimpy and -PRON- just have to eat about 2\/5 of -PRON- fry with no topping because -PRON- run out
the fry be good on -PRON- own but -PRON- know when -PRON- order specialty fry -PRON- want every bite to be cover with something
overall -PRON- would come back to try the bahn mi dog and see if -PRON- can bump up the star
love this place
if i be local -PRON- would bring -PRON- boy at least once a week
such great activity time for -PRON- and nice air conditioning for -PRON-

once -PRON- save a few more buck -PRON- will definitely be give -PRON- a call again to get the stair and bedroom do
we have a family membership here and -PRON- be worth every penny
the stingray exhibit be worth the money

wow
-PRON- be a victim of -PRON- own success for -PRON- though once -PRON- have have a cup -PRON- do not want anything else
the atmosphere be really relaxed and really comfortable
although there be not many place to sit -PRON- be nice to just walk around and chill out
-PRON- be definitely worth a look
have not be to buffalo bill be in many year and decide to go grab a dinner pack 10 wing and fry
this place be in a sad state
no a\/c on a hot sweltering day
there be nobody eat there
-PRON- believe most of -PRON- customer be through pick up and delivery
as for the meal -PRON- the wing be extremely small and anorexic
the fry be not the same as in the past
not quite sure what happen to the business
but -PRON- be definitely not what -PRON- use to be
a nice chill pub with a good wine selection
about half the pub be a more restaurant style area for food but there be still quite a bit of space for those just have drink
the service be prompt at the bar with a good knowledge of the product that -PRON- have in stock both from a wine and gin perceptive
the atmosphere be chill and relaxing and -PRON- be a great location for a drink and chat before head to the king theatre just across the road
beautiful piece of jewelry that be one of a kind masterpiece
caring honest and trustworthy staff

that be with the big o discount
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- would come back and try to get the $ 600 somehow as -PRON- be drive home drive by an auto zone
-PRON- decide to take advantage of -PRON- free alternator diagnostic
so after the test be over
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- have some loose connection and just change the battery and the cable as well
car have be run great ever since
no thank to -PRON- big o
-PRON- realize -PRON- be all here to make a buck but to take advantage of a loyal customer like -PRON- be uncalled for -PRON- will tell all -PRON- friend about this experience and hopefully -PRON- will tell all -PRON- friend as well word of mouth be a powerful thing
-PRON- be go to leave out the name of the employee who wait on -PRON- because -PRON- be forgive people but -PRON- will not forget
-PRON- be look for a place to grab lunch on the way back from the hoover dam and find this gem on yelp
good burger bottomless fry and all around good diner fare
-PRON- have the reuben per -PRON- waitress jessie 's recommendation and be not disappoint
go off the well beat chain restaurant path and try little city grille if -PRON- be in boulder city
what a great space
after go to the lawrenceville location quite often -PRON- do not know what to expect in this new robinson location
but -PRON- definitely exceed what -PRON- imagine
the space be huge and open with the same vibe as the original location
lot of brick and great table and decor
-PRON- beer selection be always so good with lot of option
-PRON- also enjoy -PRON- happy hour
the food at industry be never at the top of -PRON- list when -PRON- think of place to eat
however if -PRON- be look for a drink or happy hour special -PRON- would definitely recommend -PRON-
please do not shop
at this store
the sale lady wish -PRON- have the presence of mind to ask for h name be so rude condescend and have no customer service etiquette
go to the forum shop by caesars palace -PRON- treat -PRON- like human be there and go above and beyond catering to -PRON- request of find the perfect size and style shoe -PRON- want
this use to be a grocery outlet and -PRON- can barely tell the difference
-PRON- come in here for some veggie and ice cream and -PRON- take -PRON- almost 30 minute include the time in line
-PRON- think -PRON- will try and avoid this place from now on but the service be nice
so -PRON- give -PRON- 3 star =)
cab be smelly first driver do not show second driver be rude
not sure -PRON- could have go much bad
-PRON- hear this place be pretty cool and decide to check -PRON- out on -PRON- birthday
-PRON- be so disappointed
-PRON- be not disappoint by the drink or food but the dj be just rude
-PRON- be a saturday night and there be no one there and the dj guy be a total dick to all -PRON- friend
all -PRON- friend want to do be sing karoke since that be the only thing -PRON- could do
-PRON- ask the dj when -PRON- be -PRON- friend turn to sing and -PRON- be like when -PRON- -PRON- turn
not even in a nice way
grant maybe -PRON- be have a bad day but do not take -PRON- out on -PRON-
-PRON- friend and -PRON- go up to talk to the manager and -PRON- be not that much of a help either
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- do not own the place
well -PRON- would figure that
-PRON- be just let -PRON- know -PRON- concern to make this place better because -PRON- do have potential to be awesome but a staff like that -PRON- most def put a sour taste in -PRON- mouth
-PRON- end up go to barsmith afterwards and enjoy by birthday there instead
surprisingly bland food for a bbq joint
the coleslaw be like have cabbage with a little bit of oil and vinegar
not too mention lack of salt and
the cabbage be way too thick so -PRON- end up feel pretty dry
portion size be good but way too much fry and not enough meat on -PRON- pull pork bun
-PRON- do not think -PRON- would go back bbq pork on a bun fry coleslaw and a glass of beer $ 24 before tax
on the high side as far as price and on the low side as far as value
-PRON- be amazing -PRON- have a great time especially on the bus
joe -PRON- rock
definitly will do -PRON- again when -PRON- return
if -PRON- like richardson 's -PRON- should go there because this place be a cheap knockoff
the decor be tacky and the carne adasada have no flavor
the bacon wrap shrimp be dry and char like a spend ember
two star because the waitress be at least friendly
friendly staff

oh my gosh
-PRON- love this place chinese joint
-PRON- love the price of the stuff here and -PRON- always end up find -PRON- here to feed a big group of people or to fix a really really late night crave for chinese food
service be generally really fast but the food be normally on the salty side like oh my gosh -PRON- can totally taste the msg and -PRON- normally get a headache after eat here
and -PRON- think -PRON- be from the seasoning or just the msg -PRON- add to the meal
the place be not super clean but -PRON- be not disgusting dirty
-PRON- do like the taste of -PRON- hot tea here that -PRON- serve
food be nicely portion so like -PRON- say -PRON- definitely like the price of everything here especially because -PRON- have the special price\/portion menu
-PRON- be easy to feed a party of 10 + more people and end up only pay $ 10-$15 each if -PRON- split the bill and -PRON- will have order a shit load of food like over 6 or 7 dish
this be a good place to come and eat if -PRON- be hungry and -PRON- wanna split the bill so -PRON- can try everything that be order
-PRON- normally do a good job at accommodate very large group
bathroom be not all that clean so -PRON- would suggest hold -PRON- if -PRON- can
oh and parking be a total bitch in the plaza where this restaurant be locate so know -PRON- have be warn
when the parking lot be full which -PRON- normally be always full -PRON- have to park in the chinatown parking lot next to this plaza
-PRON- be a huge fan of downtown area diner in any city and -PRON- have see more than a few

-PRON- just toss -PRON- entire order in the trash
-PRON- cut -PRON- sashimi into cubes

extremely unprofessional and rude owner
-PRON- be not -PRON- fault -PRON- business be fail
the first time -PRON- come -PRON- put all of -PRON- bobbie pin in -PRON- mouth then into -PRON- hair gross
next -PRON- get so close to -PRON- that -PRON- feel -PRON- penis on -PRON- arm
this be disgusting and -PRON- feel awkward and uncomfortable
then -PRON- throw a fit when -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- have a groupon
josh h be an incredible artist

-PRON- be fun to work with and have no problem share -PRON- opinion lmao also even tho this shop be on the strip -PRON- be very easy to get to and find
dang
all -PRON- see be a$ $ lol
came here one afternoon to party with one of -PRON- favorite dj 's steve aoki
-PRON- buddy get a cabana booth right next to the dj booth and so all -PRON- friend could party together
in all honesty if -PRON- do not have -PRON- own cabana -PRON- would suck because there be no seat no space to put -PRON- purse or -PRON- towel or anything
also no shade so most people be bake under the hot sun
the cover be $ 40 even with a hookup
the pool also get progressively more nasty as time go on muggy and full of drunk puke
in -PRON- cabana -PRON- have several bartender who come and pour drink for -PRON- -PRON- be all very good look and very nice and attentive no surprise here since the cabana cost several grand
the food -PRON- order be absolutely disgusting and uneatable tho
-PRON- be a nice setting small venue and -PRON- do have some of the good dj 's
-PRON- be fun only if -PRON- can party in style
otherwise -PRON- be a terrible experience
tasty bake good
tasty coffee

will go back for sure and recommend
-PRON- go for lunch
-PRON- need to go back for dinner to give a fully accurate review but here be the review for lunch
-PRON- seem a bit full of -PRON-
the menu be a sheet of paper where 1\/2 list the food item and the other 1\/2 be advertisment for -PRON-
-PRON- do not want to see the price for -PRON- apparel on -PRON- menu
now that -PRON- be past the menu -PRON- order -PRON- chicken wing husband order the chicago style hot dog
both be very good
-PRON- do the chicago style hot dog justice
too bad those be just a special and not an everyday menu item
the chicken wing be good and there be a lot for $ 10 so -PRON- be a good deal
but if -PRON- be downtown and -PRON- want chicken wing -PRON- will go to black dog or farren 's which both have superior wing to these
-PRON- have a fruity slush full of rum drink
that be good
basically the place be good
not great
-PRON- could see go and sit at the bar drink beer eat wing all -PRON- can eat wing should be a weekly special and watch some sportball
but even that experience can be have at local place guido 's and esquire
the good seat in the house be probably the front window where -PRON- can watch the going on of neil street and -PRON- have a nice view of the jane addams book shop
-PRON- will go back for dinner and try some of -PRON- more talk about food
-PRON- use to go to this dilly 's deli every week when -PRON- use to live in the area never have a customer service issue and enjoy the sandwich and soup but -PRON- last visit there be not so pleasant
-PRON- go on a slow afternoon during a weekday a few week ago and there be two employee work at the time -PRON- be the only customer in the deli
-PRON- approach the menu board to decide what item to order for -PRON- family and the female employee behind the register immediately ask -PRON- what -PRON- would like to order
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- do not know yet and -PRON- demeanor quickly change and -PRON- let out an exasperated breath
-PRON- pass -PRON- off but when -PRON- be ready to order
-PRON- ask -PRON- a simple question about the combo and -PRON- get annoy and be rush -PRON- to finish -PRON- order
-PRON- be so irritated that -PRON- do not even order -PRON- meal
-PRON- pay for the item -PRON- do order and not once do -PRON- smile or say thank -PRON-
-PRON- feel like -PRON- have ruin -PRON- down time at work since no other customer be in the deli except -PRON-
whatev -PRON- deal be -PRON- attitude towards -PRON- be uncalled for
and -PRON- will never go back
as -PRON- get -PRON- item to go -PRON- ask -PRON- for -PRON- name -PRON- be lexie
-PRON- be a young brunette with a major chip on -PRON- shoulder
if -PRON- go into this deli -PRON- hope -PRON- get good service
michelle be absolutely amazing
-PRON- get -PRON- fit and look great in no time
-PRON- be thoughtful and make -PRON- feel comfortable when -PRON- have little time to rent a tux
-PRON- highly recommend this place -PRON- will have -PRON- turn head without break the bank
-PRON- have be go to zia for all of -PRON- music need for a few year now
and -PRON- have never leave empty handed
whether -PRON- be look for some vinyls or cds -PRON- find what -PRON- want or the lovely staff up front be always willing to help
this location be pretty large and -PRON- could spend hour just browse through the aisle of book record and cds like -PRON- do
-PRON- use to frequent the eastern location when -PRON- be go to school at unlv for proximity but this location be a bit close to -PRON- now
all in all great place to satisfy those musical desire
check -PRON- out when -PRON- be in the area
the strip mall area zia be locate in also have a great eye glass repair and cake shop if -PRON- be curious
-PRON- be invite for a celebration dinner
-PRON- bro get a promotion

menu look good and lot of selection
-PRON- server be nice
but -PRON- be very forgetful
-PRON- have a kid and -PRON- need a kid 's menu
never come -PRON- get up to ask for one at the hostess station
-PRON- take -PRON- order then 10 min -PRON- come back to confirm -PRON- order

omg
the service be so so slow
-PRON- have to ask anyone work by for refill
-PRON- order the st. louis ribs
ribs be good and tender
that be the highlight of the visit
-PRON- be stay at a local hotel and use online ordering to feed -PRON- crew
the ordering go smoothly and the pleasant surprise be the food arrive early and warm
-PRON- order two of -PRON- usual pizza and one of -PRON- custom order
could have have a few more topping on one of -PRON- but overall nice value and timely service with warm food
-PRON- look for the special on line and save a few dollar
worth the time to do so
would order again
-PRON- come last weekend for a bachelorette party
this hotel be aesthetically pleasing although not near as lux as ton of the review on this site would lead -PRON- to believe
also be prepared to be treat like child as many of hotel policy be mean to restrain the apparently immature stupid and by 10 p.m.
waste guest that stay here
there be 4 pool at the hotel none of which provide consistent sunlight during the day\/even hour as the hotel be in the 5 8pm shadow of the aria next door
but that mostly do not matter as the pool close at 7 anyway
after that -PRON- are not allow outside on the pool deck until the next morning when the pool open
i'm sorry
-PRON- do not know -PRON- be in prison on -PRON- vacation
-PRON- can not go outside to enjoy the hotel pool when -PRON- just pay $ 400 a night to stay here
wtf
this be obviously to keep the intoxicated mass potentially drunk and disorderly hotel guest from throw impromptu pool party
which mean the other people stay here who would like to lounge by the pool and have a cocktail after 7 be out of luck
move on
everything -PRON- want to buy on hotel premise be a shameless 3 to 4x be the price -PRON- would normally be
-PRON- spend more $ on incidental and bottled water from the convenience store as -PRON- do at the bar
room
small as -PRON- would expect
bed fine not exceptional
toiletry bigelow not worth the price of the room
mini bar do not move a thing because -PRON- will be charge
this mean -PRON- can not use the fridge and get charge for one if -PRON- want an extra which be suppose to go where in -PRON- closet of a room
yep that be about -PRON-
-PRON- will never be back here
do go talk to the concierge people before -PRON- leave to avoid have random sh#$% show up on -PRON- credit card bill when -PRON- arrive back at home
nice
do not bring child here
what be the point
the staff be nice
-PRON- feel bad for -PRON- have to deal with the attitude of many of the patron that stay here
cut little store ever
a great great great gift store if -PRON- want to buy something quirky and funny for someone
-PRON- think this be go on -PRON- fave all time store in the city
this place be a mess of pretty much anything gifty from print t 's journal card calendar book baby clothe soap etc just really creative great gift
the print t shirt be a ball -PRON- be like bumper sticker on a shirt
there be a lot of baby clothe just really adorable piece -PRON- kick -PRON- for not find this store a few month ago when -PRON- be scramble to find good quality baby clothe
rare gem of a find
-PRON- love -PRON-
a good of vegas winner in the juice bar category -PRON- discover this place with -PRON- brother during a impromptu detour through las vegas
the atmosphere be open modern with seating inside out
-PRON- really like the tower garden on the patio be surprised to find out -PRON- also have a drive thru too
fruit root sustainability effort include cold press juice bottle in glass all other packaging be completely biodegradable
excellent option for health conscious traveler dietary restriction
-PRON- definitely load up on all the juice plan to visit again again
grateful to find this gem
stay here over edc weekend because well polo towers still have availability and be relatively cheap
-PRON- truly get what -PRON- pay for though
the room -PRON- be not poorly furnish or anything
the full kitchen be great
but in vegas there be a luxury standard that polo towers miss which also lead to the service
so -PRON- can place a reservation online but -PRON- a representative will call -PRON- to confirm
and for any other issue unlike normal hotel concierge -PRON- can only call during business hour
but now -PRON- know what -PRON- be like to go through a time share\/hotel
but to make matter bad parking be horrible
the structure -PRON- be poorly lay out and there be hardly any parking available at all hour
as the 5 star rating indicate this be as good as -PRON- get with spa
-PRON- actually find this place on a whim when -PRON- regular spa be close on a monday so glad -PRON- do
-PRON- be a repeat client for waxing and -PRON- have to say eleen do an outstanding job
not only be -PRON- extremely professional -PRON- also have great technique and be focus on -PRON- comfort throughout the entire process
-PRON- have be to many other spa in the past and none have even come close to the stellar treatment -PRON- have receive here
also important to note this spa abstain from double dipping with -PRON- wax pot
-PRON- think this be virtually unheard of in the wax world
-PRON- be great to know -PRON- be not cut corner and be look out for -PRON- client health
overall excellent spa
-PRON- have yet to try any of -PRON- other service though the entire layout of the spa be superb and everything appear to be sterile and orderly
highly recommend
this place be good for friend and family to play badminton
-PRON- boyfriend be look to get a new car
-PRON- deal with a salesman name troy
troy be rude and act like the typical stereotypical car salesman that -PRON- see on tv

after a series of call and an hour after the estimate delivery time someone pick up just to tell -PRON- oh sorry -PRON- cancel -PRON- order because -PRON- be too busy

the one star be for the decent ice tea -PRON- order
nos hospedamo en el mandalay bay durante nuestra visita en las vegas y sin duda lo volvería hacer creo q no tengo quejas como hotel lujoso q es
la comida es lo típico de las vegas restaurant lujoso como económico y quisimo probar los do comimo en un restaurante pegado al área de las piscina muy rico pero para nada económico
y el buffet nada del otro mundo a mi la verdad no -PRON-
gusto mucho también pedimos pizza a la habitación le puedo dar un 10
.estaba vigilado en las áreas de elevador
no dejaban pasar sin mostrar las llav de habitación
esta de mas decir
el show de michael jackson cogimo unos asientos adelante
q podíamo ver como
si de verdad estuviera vivo jackson el casino
muy
tranquilo
y los trago para ser free estaban bueno
pero sin duda la vista es de las cosas q mas disfruto en mi viajes
y esta estaba sin duda maravillosa
-PRON- quite like this place although -PRON- be a bit strange but not in a bad way -PRON- be awfully small
-PRON- think which add to the charm
definitely would go back only lose a star because some item on the menu be painfully overprice like pain and not the good kind
but overall the food be absolute delicious and if -PRON- be not a pretentious portuguese little twat like some people who have write terrible review of this restaurant for no reason -PRON- will enjoy -PRON-
get the beer on tap and anything with the home make piri piri sauce both be insanely delicious
order the lobster roll and the crispy calamari to start both delicious both moderately price
the calamari have an interesting batter to -PRON- not one -PRON- would usually expect but -PRON- enjoy -PRON- much more because of that!.
there be 3 lobster roll which be a good portion for 14 $
that be a pretty sweet deal
ok the lobster be not the fresh
but -PRON- be really good anyways suggestion
should any of the owner bother to read this review can -PRON- indicate for the love of piri piri the amount -PRON- be get for every menu item please
i though -PRON- be 1 lobster roll and -PRON- boyfriend have to ask the waiter about the rib and chicken plate for serving also -PRON- make a mistake and over order on desert annoying main chicken club with fry and salad and the bf take the chicken and rib combo
rib be melt in yo mouth but the sauce be not great
the chicken be delicious all around
-PRON- have 2 drumstick and the chicken in -PRON- club be a breast all delicious and cook to perfect tenderness
the piri piri sauce though wow
good job on that whoever make -PRON- -PRON- want to take some home -PRON- be so good
as for the desert -PRON- get natas
-PRON- only problem be with the waiter -PRON- make a mistake and order two order of nata -PRON- ask -PRON- to take one order out literally 30 second later and -PRON- say -PRON- could not do -PRON- because -PRON- already punch -PRON- in
the heat from -PRON- fingertip touch the touch screen cash have not even wear off when -PRON- tell -PRON- this
desert cost -PRON- 16 $ and -PRON- could not finish because -PRON- be too much food
this make -PRON- particularly mad because -PRON- have work both in restaurant and retail
and -PRON- know -PRON- way around a cash
-PRON- can delete an item soooo easily
a caveman can do -PRON- and as for the chef in the back
-PRON- literally ask as soon as -PRON- finish punch -PRON- in so really there should not have be a problem
if -PRON- be look to add an extra menu item -PRON- succeed if -PRON- be look for tip fat chance
that be a complete dick move
but then again -PRON- don t expect much from laval service staff tip and ass on a stick for the waitress and meat for brain waiter
other than that great time and great food
some of the bad customer service -PRON- have experience
be tell pizza would take 20 minute wait 39 minute
first time -PRON- first time ordering person take the order very impatient and have an attitude
place be kinda dirty
pizza be good
but -PRON- be stingy with the ingredient
mostly bread
would not recommend or go back
there be good pizza place in las vegas
owner need to redeem -PRON- name and work on customer service and be more generous with the ingredient
awesome cafe
love the vibe
the inside be very clean
-PRON- be pretty quiet
but -PRON- be there on a off time
there be a couple tv 's to watch and keep post on sport or news
the furniture be amazing feel like -PRON- be in a lounge
there be also a fish tank which -PRON- really enjoy watch as -PRON- eat
the coffee and food be really good -PRON- order a cinnamon roll with a large coffee
-PRON- will definitely be back
-PRON- have go there with a friend and -PRON- notice -PRON- be very busy like any other nail salon i feel rush and the nail tech -PRON- have -PRON- do -PRON- nail quickly
-PRON- be not bad for -PRON- be do quickly
but -PRON- -PRON- do not listen to -PRON- when -PRON- tell -PRON- to make -PRON- short why do majority nail place rush and make nail long
now that -PRON- look at -PRON-
-PRON- mess up on a couple of nail a bit pricey for this kind of service -PRON- would not suggest go there because -PRON- be just fast
-PRON- have go to this location just about every month since -PRON- open
the food quality have go down tremendously unfortunately
chicken be dry salmon over cook and once -PRON- shrimp tempura be gray and spoil on the inside
yuck
switch to the mesa river view location much high quality food preparation
-PRON- have love there food every time -PRON- have go there
until the last few time there have be constantly change
and the food have a look and taste as if -PRON- have be sit out
and the food be cold which be a bummer because -PRON- take -PRON- to go
-PRON- walk in and no one be in there except for the employee
-PRON- like mokis
but -PRON- do not think -PRON- will be go back anytime soon

-PRON- call the company as a follow up to prior service at -PRON- vegas house after spot a scorpion
-PRON- be very responsive and quickly arrange a treatment
-PRON- technician be derek
-PRON- be very helpful and efficient
-PRON- answer all question and make sure -PRON- understand the service that have be do
-PRON- would highly recommend -PRON- service

-PRON- would give more star if -PRON- could
generally -PRON- do not even try chain restaurant when -PRON- be in vegas simply because -PRON- feel like -PRON- can get that food outside of vegas -PRON- be afraid of be sorely disappointed
but this be vegas -PRON- take a gamble and win big time
-PRON- husband and -PRON- friend get the steak chop the lobster
as -PRON- friend put -PRON- the lobster be both sweet with just a tad bit of saltiness for flavor -PRON- be succulent and when dip into the butter simply divine
so -PRON- move to the steak both of -PRON- be skeptical that -PRON- would be impressed at all well -PRON- be wrong
as -PRON- husband put -PRON- the steak be so tender
-PRON- barely even need a knife to cut -PRON- -PRON- could have just use the edge of -PRON- fork
the steak be tender savory and make to perfection
wow right
-PRON- also have the stone crab because that be joe 's signature dish -PRON- definitely do not disappoint
meaty and flavorful
-PRON- have the grill seafood platter with shrimp scallop lobster tail
the one major problem with -PRON- be that -PRON- finish all of -PRON-
and then -PRON- be go
-PRON- suppose -PRON- give -PRON- a chance to dive into -PRON- side mac cheese sautéed spinach and stuff mushroom
mac cheese
shell pasta strike the balance of firmness but not too hard and the shape -PRON- discover handily scoop up hold the cheese so that everything land into -PRON- mouth
stuffed mushroom be also nicely do with the mushroom retain the flavor from the buttery stuffing let -PRON- be honest that be always a good thing
and the spinach be -PRON- one vegetable make extra delicious with seasoned butter-\/or something like that
the staff be very helpful knowledgeable engage
-PRON- know a couple member of -PRON- party be on a tight schedule so -PRON- get -PRON- order go quickly to get -PRON- feed and out the door
-PRON- have to say that -PRON- very much appreciate that even after those 2 leave -PRON- be still make to feel welcome to sit and stay
there be no pressure at all to leave even though -PRON- be busy
of course -PRON- then order dessert and coffee
dessert generously sized delicious nuf say
all in all this be a surprisingly delightful find
and of course -PRON- will be back
friend and -PRON- be shop at fashion show and be look for a place to grab some food
-PRON- stumble into ra and realize -PRON- be happy hour 3 7pm
prices for drink sake beer well drink and appetizer be probably one of the good deal in town
and the staff be friendly and very accommodate of -PRON- tiny tot and big fat stroller
no snootiness here
-PRON- be a pleasant surprise
wish -PRON- could say the same for the food
the roll be puny and poorly make
the scallop dynamite be more onion than anything else
lobster spring roll have too much cream cheese and not enough anything else
despite all -PRON- complaint about the food would -PRON- go back
possibly
-PRON- be convenient and price be not bad
come here this past sunday and order the vegan combo for two
service be wonderful food be great and -PRON- leave stuffed
although -PRON- be all out at the time -PRON- boyfriend be particularly impress by the fact that -PRON- have vegan lassi 's available on the menu
that be right soy yogurt lassi

-PRON- order chicken finger and garlic fry the finger be standard but the fry be amazing

after be subject to really shoddy work at other salon find m nails be like come home
all the staff be great but david in particular be a perfectionist and be still put the finish touch to -PRON- nail ninety minute after -PRON- official closing time
-PRON- be also very well informed about the difference between different type of artificial nail
-PRON- trust this place

cracker 's company have always be a favorite breakfast destination
the food be always delicious and the selection more unique than other restaurant
-PRON- husband and -PRON- come in for a quiet anniversary breakfast and although the place be not terribly crowd -PRON- be seat right next to a table of ill mannered child and -PRON- mother
-PRON- would have ask to move but -PRON- waitress be miss in action from the start of -PRON- visit
before -PRON- waitress go mia -PRON- order -PRON- drink and entree
in the past -PRON- have be give a small carafe of coffee but be only give a cup today which be disappointing
-PRON- order a carrot cake muffin when -PRON- order -PRON- entree and ask to have -PRON- serve right away with -PRON- coffee
-PRON- also ask for the hollandaise sauce on the side of -PRON- new princess omelet but -PRON- be spread over the top when -PRON- be deliver to -PRON- table along with -PRON- muffin
so much for enjoy -PRON- muffin with -PRON- one cup of coffee
however the food be wonderful as usual
the service be horrible and the ambiance be equally as poor
-PRON- would hate to see a wonderful restaurant such as cracker lose -PRON- edge in this competitive food service industry
-PRON- be hop today be a fluke and the service will improve to -PRON- previous caliber
pizza be a little blah from how -PRON- use to be back in the day
this place be crowd but the server be friendly
get two slice to go and -PRON- could have be good
-PRON- be on a time crunch
next time -PRON- be in arizona -PRON- will make -PRON- a point to dine in and hopefully the pizza will be more fresh and tasty
crave some delicious seafood soup after a long night of partying\/gambling\/sinn while in vegas
oyster bar be the place to go
the pan roast combo be a lovely and happy mix of lobster shrimp and shrimp in a lobster bisque type of soup
also recommend the alaskan chowder which be the same mix of seafood goodness but do up clam chowd style
both soup be very rich and flavorful
both soup be very fill so be prepare for left over
-PRON- will be transform via stomach from hungry hungover to happy ready for bed
why only 4 star then if -PRON- so good
the wait
unfortunately there be only about 15 or so seat and there be only 6 station for -PRON- to cook at so -PRON- may be wait in line for 2 hour before -PRON- can eat
avoid come at noon or dinner time if -PRON- want to avoid the line
good friendly service
definitely a gem in the dirt of an old beat up hotel -PRON- would not step in to for any other reason
-PRON- a must stop when -PRON- be in town
so to answer that crazy question -PRON- encounter every once in awhile in vegas what would drive a man to leave the comfort of -PRON- on the strip mega hotel at 5 a.m. and go to an old crappy look beat up hotel on the outskirt of the main crawl
oyster bar -PRON- silly friend
oyster bar
walk in to purchase a volcano but the two employee feel as though the conversation -PRON- be have be more important than the wait customer
-PRON- walk out after 10 minute without even be acknowledge
this location lose out on some business tonight sell a $ 600 device
will be order -PRON- online and never return to this location again
this be not the first time that the service here have be absolutely awful
go there once drive throw ordr 2 fish dinner be tell to park out front and -PRON- would bring -PRON- to -PRON- after 15 minute i go inside and -PRON- forget about -PRON-
-PRON- finaly get -PRON- fish and -PRON- be so small i be still hungery
rather then make a fus i get n line and tell -PRON- what happen
not a word back
-PRON- will never go back there ever
terrible to treat people that way
after see the review online -PRON- take -PRON- wife 's 2008 mini cooper s here the other day to check out the battery and a fluid leak
jerry be very helpful
-PRON- get back to -PRON- quickly after inspect the car

-PRON- be very happy with the price for part and labor
also happy that -PRON- use mini part
very satisfied
go here for a birthday dinner
nice varied menu which lean towards seafood
food be prepare well pricing be pretty affordable for a classy restaurant
service be accommodate friendly
decor be warm cozy surprisingly not pack could of be because -PRON- be a deary rainy day
restaurant be not very large but good for a small to a mid size gathering
would definitely recommend
well do for what -PRON- be japanese\/thai\/chinese in a fairly modern setting
very nice server can't recall the name
i'll add -PRON- in with an edit to this review if -PRON- find the receipt in -PRON- wallet which look like george costanza 's seinfeld reference of course
-PRON- wife enjoy -PRON- shrimp pad thai and -PRON- bbq pork slice with rice be good
-PRON- would return any time
chocolate terra cotta warrior be literally the most expensive dessert i have ever see
-PRON- have be go here exclusively for about a year now
-PRON- be all very good and professional and reasonably price
-PRON- will not be disappoint
-PRON- be lucky enough to spend time off the strip for -PRON- vacation last october and a friend who live nearby recommend dw bistro and -PRON- be in love
be foodie from pdx -PRON- consider this place to be absolutely fantastic rival and top a lot of breakfast restaurant here
from the coffee to the cuban benedict to the most fabulous carrot cake
each bite be savor for the beautiful flavor on the tongue and sadness abound after the last bite
the service be attentive and wonderful -PRON- be sad that -PRON- could not make -PRON- out there a second time before -PRON- leave
-PRON- must be the water as this truly be the good brooklyn pizza west of the hudson
try not to be the first order or two out of the oven for the lunch crowd
oven not be quite ready yet at least that be why -PRON- be explain to -PRON-
also if -PRON- be into walk around old town scottsdale to see all that be there then by all mean visit that location however if -PRON- want to visit a modern shopping area mister in the open area and a parking garage that always seem to have plenty of parking visit the scottsdale quarter location
this be a step up from regular bar food
everything taste great
-PRON- get hummus shrimp scampi quinoa salad and taco
food be top notch
the place look really cute inside
although -PRON- look nice when -PRON- be sedona
-PRON- do like the remodel
the service be good and -PRON- be happy to see this bar alive with people because sedona would be dead on a monday night
-PRON- wish -PRON- have better happy hour though
the price be a bit high for a neighborhood bar but if -PRON- want something nice than -PRON- regular pts -PRON- would suggest check this place out
-PRON- will definitely be back
roto rooter plumbers august 14 2011
-PRON- call roto rooter on monday morning at 7 a.m. and ricky be at -PRON- house by 9 a.m.
-PRON- be able to unclog -PRON- kitchen sink\/garbage disposal in a matter of minute and -PRON- be very personable and professional
the only reason -PRON- give roto rooter 4 star instead of 5 be because the $ 213 bill catch -PRON- a little by surprise
then again -PRON- do not know what the go rate be for unclog a drain
luckily -PRON- be offer a $ 40 coupon
fantastic price customer service and speed
-PRON- be in and out with two like new tire at a fraction of the cost in less than 30 minute
-PRON- could not have be friendly either
-PRON- would highly recommend these guy
for the 4 year -PRON- have own -PRON- suv -PRON- have not be detailed\/clean on the inside
this poor vehicle have live through eat fast food on the go a vomiting yorkie puppy and muddy boot from snowstorm
a detailing be long overdue
the anu wave company be offer a groupon and -PRON- buy -PRON- for a half price detailing service
the guy who come to -PRON- house spend an hour and a half clean the leather wipe down and polish the rim dust and shin every surface
the car go through an extreme makeover and look brand new again
the only teeny tiny flaw be a mini nick in the wood steeling wheel
-PRON- do not really bother -PRON- and should not hinder anyone from use anu
would pay full price for service again
try again at the slow whataburger on earth
7 minute to take the order of the two car in front of -PRON-
ask to wait before take -PRON- order
1.5 minute wait before takin -PRON- order
4 minute to deliver order to the 3 car in front of -PRON-
2.5 minute wait to receive -PRON- order
total 14 minute for fast food drive through
-PRON- may as well go to a sit down restaurant
-PRON- be a big bbq fan and have try virtually every place within a 50 mile radius of pittsburgh and many further out include texas and memphis but unfortunately selma 's be not one that -PRON- will want to go back to
as -PRON- can see on -PRON- webpage -PRON- close -PRON- meat in a smoker with the meat drip directly on the fire which create cloud of sooty black smoke not wood smoke
thus the chicken and rib have a greasy sooty black coating instead of the reddish brown smoke look that -PRON- crave
among the many good choice be pittsburgh bbq company on banksville clems on rt 22 or state college
smokin memphis bbq in brighton heights be quite good as well
but -PRON- have be close for month with a note in the window about a hospital emergency
if -PRON- do not mind drive a couple hour for good bbq -PRON- think old carolina bbq in cleveland be even good than anything -PRON- can find in the burgh
-PRON- be a regular feature at the steelers season opener
ribfest if -PRON- do not mind wait
have the supreme nachos with the shredded beef here
5 minute later -PRON- end up with a case of cold sweat and the food poisoning have begin to run -PRON- course
-PRON- have to purge to feel human again
avoid this place at all cost
have the grill pork and grill chicken sandwich
not a big sandwich fan but enjoy both
could have be a little more topping which would have make -PRON- more filling
love -PRON- here
-PRON- be always friendly and helpful
if -PRON- do not have what -PRON- need on hand -PRON- will order -PRON- for -PRON-
the class be great and the instructor be awesome
a 3.5 star spot
have a deli in the middle of the las vegas strip be very very tricky
people expect to get huge portion but to pay affordable price
for most deli that would work but for a deli that -PRON- locate at the mirage casino -PRON- just can not happen
the food be good
-PRON- be very tasty-
the sandwich be big
-PRON- shnitzel be crispy and good
-PRON- turkey sandwich be yummy
-PRON- matzoh ball soup be just like grandma
one of the good part be actually the service
super nice friendly server will do anything to make -PRON- happy
especially pam- -PRON- do a fantastic job
and be do that for year
another cool thing about this spot be that -PRON- give discount to local
and this thing can be an issue because this place be expensive
so overall -PRON- be a good place
not the good deli -PRON- have be to but tasty and super friendly staff
too bad -PRON- expensive
trust -PRON-
-PRON- know food
beef spicy scallop hand roll
squid sushi
tamago sushi chicken teriyaki
good if -PRON- want an average pizza and hot\/cold italian dish
-PRON- order an italian sub
-PRON- taste great but i get a pile of broken chip with -PRON-
-PRON- love chip so i be bummed to see a pile of crumb
-PRON- barely eat -PRON-
overall
-PRON- be good but not amazing
-PRON- go to starbucks
the home of -PRON- canadian starbucks card that go everywhere -PRON- travel
friendly staff fast and efficient
some parking at the back
this be another cantor gaming race and sports book
the concept of cantor gaming be a pretty good one
the execution or implementation of the concept have be do very poorly though
the idea be to set up an account deposit money and enjoy real time bet on a terminal that -PRON- sit at
when -PRON- be do -PRON- retrieve what -PRON- have leave in the account before -PRON- leave
the terminal in theory should allow -PRON- to bet and watch -PRON- game or horse race in real time
-PRON- be all touchscreen and should be very easy to use
that be how -PRON- should be set up to work
here be why -PRON- do not like how -PRON- have implement -PRON-
the account first of all if -PRON- go to one casino and set up an account -PRON- information be non transferable
-PRON- have to set up a new account at each casino
why be that bad
the account be setup all on paper
-PRON- have to fill out paperwork not fill out information on a computer terminal sign several thing set up a pin deposit -PRON- money which be also a paper receipt transaction etc
the setup take a good 15 20 minute every time
think -PRON- want to bet horse and other sporting event try two account and twice the pain
awful
the terminal first of all the terminal at venetian would not allow -PRON- to log in
-PRON- have to go back several time and have -PRON- reset the account
now -PRON- be 45 minute -PRON- have be in the sport book
and -PRON- be still not bet
not a very relaxing afternoon of bet horse so far
the cosmo another cantor gaming book set up go much smooth but still very painful
the terminal and -PRON- have now experience the one at cosmo and venetian be very slow and unresponsive to touch
push a button
wait a few second push again
and then -PRON- end up with a double push immediately
very frustrating
on top of that -PRON- could not figure out how to bring up the horse bet interface
try as -PRON- could
now -PRON- be be over an hour
and -PRON- be fight with the terminal
-PRON- move to another and another
same result and -PRON- give up
get -PRON- money back and just use the snail method of walk -PRON- bet up to the counter
drink ticket -PRON- be very strict on the drink ticket
at the cosmo -PRON- give -PRON- a few for sign up but none for bet
so though -PRON- be sit at the terminal do in game betting -PRON- be get no more ticket for -PRON- betting
-PRON- never get that far at the venetian
the conclusion great idea awful execution of the idea
those in charge of develop and deploy the technology behind the cantor gaming experience should be fire and never allow to work in the it field again
the system be completely unusable and make -PRON- want to avoid the sport book where -PRON- be find
-PRON- be sure this be cost the casino revenue
-PRON- advice be to avoid if at all possible
this place be fantastic
-PRON- decide that during this trip to vegas -PRON- would stay away from the strip 's overpriced restaurant
-PRON- find this one on trusty yelp
and -PRON- guy get -PRON- right
-PRON- choose this place for dinner on a monday night at 5:30pm to celebrate -PRON- wedding anniversary
-PRON- decide on the 3 course pre fixe for $ 55 per person
-PRON- have the bbq shrimp with bleu cheese slaw the halibut over a bed of spinach and the molten chocolate cake for dessert
-PRON- husband have the carpaccio and the rack of lamb
at the end of -PRON- meal the chef send out a special plate of dessert with happy anniversary write across the plate
-PRON- be thoughtful and yummy
this place be a real gem
thanks rosemary 's for a fantastic dining experience
ps
-PRON- also receive a call from the restaurant the day after -PRON- meal to ensure that -PRON- enjoy -PRON- dining experience
amazing
the good vee give -PRON- exactly what -PRON- want eventually
the bad
-PRON- be so mean
omg
-PRON- admit -PRON- should have open -PRON- mouth sooner when -PRON- first put the fake tip on because -PRON- be far too long
that be -PRON- fault
-PRON- end up ask after -PRON- have already put the acrylic on if -PRON- could file -PRON- down some more and oh man
the look on -PRON- face be 2000 irritation
-PRON- do and -PRON- be beautiful but -PRON- also visibly hat -PRON- choice of color -PRON- want two different type of sparkle and make this awful face of disgust when -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- want to layer glitter
overall -PRON- be gifted and precise but also cold rude and unwelcom
-PRON- love -PRON- final result but -PRON- make -PRON- feel really terrible get -PRON-
hello 2016
and hello gold
thank -PRON- yelp
-PRON- be be quite a journey
-PRON- be constantly an evolve and grow process and -PRON- be very grateful for the experience
so thank -PRON- and a big hug to katie b
-PRON- be sure -PRON- have a lot to do with -PRON- yelplife and this privilege
-PRON- first restaurant review this year go to bouchon bistro at the venetian
bouchon be probably -PRON- favorite spot in vegas
yeah
i know -PRON- be silly
-PRON- have one in beverly hills
but i guess -PRON- be partly sentimental since hubby and i din here back here when -PRON- be date
the other part
thomas keller just charm -PRON-
yeah
that be sentimental too
but what i really mean to say be that tk manage to impress and delight -PRON- and i walk away with a fond memory every time
so i come along with hubby on -PRON- work assignment and the booger for a few day
there be just a few spot i really want to hit before head home
yeah
there be so many choice in vegas and -PRON- can get pretty overwhelming
on the strip off the strip
la la la
i have the pleasure of live in vegas many year ago hence i be happy to keep -PRON- simple
so on -PRON- last evening i choose bouchon
reminiscent of -PRON- date day but return with a renew perspective after have din at the french laundry a few year ago on -PRON- babymoon
-PRON- be a sunday evening on a 3-day weekend -PRON- arrive a bit early for -PRON- ressie and -PRON- table be not ready but -PRON- be promptly seat
when i stop to ask if a booth table be available for the comfort of -PRON- son -PRON- step out of -PRON- way to find one
one be not available but -PRON- manage to keep the little one well behave with the godsend ipad
the standard epi bread and butter be set on -PRON- table
the server peel off the butter seal reveal perfectly spreadable butter not the kind -PRON- usually get that be still hard straight out of the fridge thank -PRON- and a lovely ramekin of warm toast pistachio
i start off with a half dozen fresh oyster and a glass of the pinot blanc oui from alsace francé
hubby go for -PRON- go to sear foie gras
for the little one since -PRON- do not offer a kid menu -PRON- waiter offer kiddie pasta
i nod in parental approval ask -PRON- to put that order in right away and -PRON- wish be grant
meanwhile hubby and i enjoy -PRON- hor d'oeuvres somehow magically in peace
the seared foie gras be plat on toast baguette surround with friseé and a gorgeous crimson berry compote with crunchy lightly candy whole hazelnut
-PRON- remind -PRON- of the bar tartine foie gra and jelly sandwich
i have long ago even before the foie gra ban but this be a more grow up version
and -PRON- oyster be just sublime
two variety be new england
and i can not remember the rest but -PRON- pair well with -PRON- pinot blanc
one of the highlight -PRON- will notice walk in be -PRON- gorgeous oyster bar
-PRON- can not get those out of -PRON- mind when contemplate -PRON- meal
while the first two of -PRON- be tiny next two be medium then finish by two enormous sized oyster
all so fresh as if -PRON- just come off the boat and perfectly chill for -PRON- entreé i choose from the truffle menu
i have never have a gnudi before and -PRON- server recommend -PRON-
top with black winter truffle how could i not indulge
hubby go back and forth decide between the roast chicken and the lamb shank and finally decide on the latter
when -PRON- truffle pasta arrive -PRON- eye widen by
-PRON- be pretty presentation and do wonder how i would fill up on the five little dumpling but wipe away all -PRON- discern that first bite be divine
the pasta layer be so delicate -PRON- can not find where -PRON- end and the ricotta parmesan filling begin
such a cloudy pillow of lightness
-PRON- be cheese but not cheesy nor creamy
just beside -PRON-
so happy with -PRON- choice
i will forever remember this bite alongside the pearl and oyster from tfl
hubby 's lamb shank be expertly execute
so tender and flavorful with just the right amount of fat and comforting savory
literally fall off the bone lusciousness but i secretly wish -PRON- have choose the roast chicken
but only because i have yet to try anything ordinary ie chicken as ordinary as chicken can be
from tk and still need to experience -PRON- take on -PRON-
but that will just call for another visit
-PRON- son 's pasta arrive in perfect timing
-PRON- be settle into -PRON- entreé long before -PRON- receive -PRON- main so that allow -PRON- meal to flow smoothly
-PRON- pasta gently season for a child
-PRON- be neither too cheesy nor buttery
and -PRON- be also perfectly warm
i do not need to wait for -PRON- to cool for -PRON- palate
-PRON- be able to eat -PRON- as soon as -PRON- be present to -PRON- and picky little -PRON- eat the entire thing
wow
-PRON- be still blow away
i never imagine have a tk dinner go smoothly with -PRON- restless 3yo son
but -PRON- happen

this experience be -PRON- daughter first time away from -PRON- ever
no one else have ever be a primary care provider for -PRON- baby other than -PRON- self

-PRON- originally choose a different location against -PRON- gut feeling and regret -PRON- so much
-PRON- unenroll -PRON- daughter from that daycare after a horrible experience and run back to the torrey pines location
this location be further out of -PRON- way from -PRON- house and work

this be not just a daycare but really be a school for child
-PRON- can not speak enough about all the teacher and staff at this school
each time -PRON- call to check on -PRON- daughter
-PRON- immediately know who -PRON- baby be by name and do not have to lol -PRON- up to know who -PRON- be ask about
-PRON- always go out of -PRON- way to check on -PRON- for -PRON- and tell -PRON- exactly be -PRON- be do and how -PRON- be do when -PRON- call
-PRON- know -PRON- be probably bothersome
but -PRON- understand -PRON- be -PRON- first time and never make -PRON- feel bad for check in
-PRON- be so reassuring
when -PRON- walk in everyone say hi to -PRON- baby by name
and -PRON- be just such a personal experience
-PRON- could go on and on about how much -PRON- love -PRON- here
but -PRON- will end -PRON- review with a thank -PRON- to all -PRON- daughter teacher and the staff for not only take care of -PRON- baby but give -PRON- such a safe and love educational experience
each ingredient in -PRON- tonkinese soup be very rich in flavor
especially the broth
the recipe -PRON- be in -PRON- opinion the good one compare to -PRON- competition
the staff be super friendly and accommodate always in a good mood
-PRON- recommend this establishment for any occasion
this place be great
the room be modern and beautiful
bed be comfy and hotel staff be not uptight about the 10 party animal that stay on the same floor and have a great time 5 star if the cocktail be comp in the casino
go here with -PRON- sister -PRON- all get the impression -PRON- be racist as -PRON- wait 15 min for anyone to acknowledge -PRON-
then when -PRON- sister try order the all american burger the waitress start laugh and say in a sarcastic tone
oh -PRON- be sure -PRON- want the allllll american burger then walk away and be help other table -PRON- feel so uncomfortable
-PRON- say fuck this and walk out not to mention the hostess be the same way to -PRON- dad just plain racist
i do pedicure gel pure colour here for $ 58
eventually this nail salon store be good at do pretty and neat design on gel and -PRON- be all use japanese gel
so i guess that be why -PRON- be little more expensive than the other store
but i think -PRON- worth that price
i would love to go back again and do -PRON- nail design there since -PRON- be focus on design
love this place and great service
-PRON- enjoy -PRON- meal here
-PRON- do not see any roach like arik claim
-PRON- do however find the place to be old and somewhat run down
what do -PRON- expect from an old family style sonoran mexican restaurant
-PRON- salsa be tasty and the burrito enchilada style be great
-PRON- would go back
but -PRON- be not on -PRON- short list
-PRON- be just okay
very delicious
cook well
great topping
generous with the guac
-PRON- cook the burrito to perfection
the people who work there be all really nice
-PRON- have be here twice and love the food
the service be very slow but server be nice
favorite be the arizona roll
-PRON- sit on patio both time and bring -PRON- 2 toddler

the also have a kid menu(hard to find at a sushi place)that include cheeseburger and chicken finger and be pretty tasty
-PRON- visit this hidden gem during a conference montreal
have read yelp review -PRON- know to get there early and to order the mac and cheese
and oh
-PRON-
god
be -PRON- delicious
the salty sweet christmas ham on top combine with the cream base sauce and truffle oil to create a unique flavor -PRON- have never before encounter
every now and then -PRON- would crunch on a salt crystal
unreal
pair w a local blond beer this be -PRON- favorite meal in montreal hand down
do not miss -PRON-
-PRON- house have old anderson window that be very expensive to replace when -PRON- break
the designate repair company for anderson want an arm and a leg to replace a small window so -PRON- try other vendor
-PRON- call crystal and -PRON- give a fair quote for the custom glass replacement
-PRON- bring out sample of glass to ensure -PRON- would be happy with the tint before order the glass
-PRON- take about a month or two for -PRON- to order the special glass and build the replacement window
-PRON- then come out and instal -PRON-
installation be quite arduous
briefly -PRON- shutter block the lock ring from be pull out
eric the installer do a terrific job overcome the issue by cut the ring and then reinsert -PRON- and caulk where -PRON- cut -PRON- to make -PRON- look like -PRON- do not actually cut ring
-PRON- really appreciate the positive attitude -PRON- exhibit and -PRON- willingness to perform a difficult replacement that be potentially fraught with risk
the window be instal now and look great
big thank crystal clear view glass for have great technician like eric
this be a great spot for carnivore and herbivore alike
go here after a walk around woodbine park and have one of the good veggie burger of -PRON- life
in the first bite cheese literally explode out of the deep fry portobello mushroom burger
-PRON- be heaven
highly recommend
boyfriend with the actual meat burger seem equally if not more pleased
great off the strip thai restaurant
this place be locate in a strip mall with a bunch of seedy shop but do not let that dissuade -PRON- from try out the food
come on a sun for lunch and -PRON- be empty
for food -PRON- order the spring roll kao soi and cashew nut chicken
the spring roll be standard so worth get if -PRON- like that
cashew nut chicken come out first
-PRON- bf always get that
so -PRON- have smoke a fair amount and this be up there
kao soi be a big bowl of yellow curry a heaping amount of chicken and bean sprout
the broth be really rich in flavor
highly recommend this dish

please hire more well train employee and stock up -PRON- supply
the sandwich still rock btw
yummy fresh mexican food
-PRON- have be to each of the location a few time and overall -PRON- be good
-PRON- only complaint be a personal preference -PRON- do not like the taste of bacon with the black bean
again this be -PRON- taste whereas someone else may prefer -PRON-
everything else have be awesome and
so -PRON- recommend anything on -PRON- menu except the side of black bean
post on behalf of of all the 2017 waunakee graduate

terrific chicken tender be a huge hit with the kid and adult volunteer
outstanding quality and wonderful community benefactor
talk about a mall
this place have -PRON- all and then some
nordstrom rack be -PRON- top fav
very small portion for the price
food taste funny
will not come back again will not recommend to anyone
-PRON- start take -PRON- car to this specific firestone location several year ago
despite there be several other firestones closer to -PRON- home -PRON- continue go out of -PRON- way to the 35th and bell location for all of -PRON- maintenance need
one of the thing that -PRON- hate about many of these auto maintenance store especially the one at dealership be that -PRON- can take -PRON- car in for a simple 20 dollar oil change and -PRON- will bring -PRON- back a laundry list of item that -PRON- try to scare -PRON- into get do
if -PRON- decline -PRON- start pressure -PRON- convince -PRON- that -PRON- car will break down if -PRON- do not buy into -PRON- bs
what -PRON- fail to realize be that this high pressure approach be what drive most customer away
if -PRON- be not broke do not fix -PRON-
fortunately -PRON- keep that to a minimum at this particular firestone
while -PRON- occasionally give -PRON- recommendation base on -PRON- mileage such as all those damned flush and high mileage oil that -PRON- have learn be not necessary -PRON- have never pressure -PRON- into get anything that -PRON- do not want
and if -PRON- do find something that need changed\/fix -PRON- always tell -PRON- without make any exaggeration
-PRON- have never have to wait more than a few hour for any work that need to be do and find the staff to be very honest and professional
-PRON- do have one experience that -PRON- would not call bad so much as awkward
the crew fail to find a mechanical issue that -PRON- describe but still charge -PRON- for the inspection
seek a second opinion another mechanic be able to successfully identify and fix the problem
when -PRON- call firestone corporate to see about get -PRON- waste money refund -PRON- be fine with -PRON-
the manager however be very defensive and give -PRON- a good reprimanding for not take the car back to -PRON- as oppose to go to another mechanic
eventually -PRON- money be refund but -PRON- do feel the whole guilt trip approach to a longtime customer be a bit of a stretch
the main guy dan have be work at firestone for many many year and -PRON- have also notice that a lot of -PRON- mechanic also seem to stick around for the long haul
as long as -PRON- keep -PRON- car run and well maintain -PRON- will continue to recommend -PRON- to other
vegan big mac be pretty solid a little bit pricy than -PRON- expect
have -PRON- first massage ever today
-PRON- neck be in really rough condition so -PRON- call and -PRON- get -PRON- in the same day
doug be amazing
-PRON- will be back
-PRON- have come to know this location as bad fry be even though such a connotation suggest there must be a good fry 's somewhere
just off the light rail anchor a shopping center with a mcdonald 's and a verizon store this store be truely ghetto
con
everyone constantly hit -PRON- up for money in the parking lot
-PRON- be serious
-PRON- have have lady come up to -PRON- as -PRON- be get in -PRON- car
excuse -PRON-
how be -PRON- do
hi
i'm try to and after -PRON- immediately wave -PRON- off and tell -PRON- no -PRON- turn and get in the vehicle park right next to -PRON-
there be no shame amongst these people
pro
these people will sell -PRON- thi snap benefit for penny on the dollar
cash be king and there be a wells fargo with an atm just inside the store
stick -PRON- to the manufacture food lobbyist by use those food stamp for fresh produce -PRON- produce be not horrible

pro
-PRON- put a starbucks inside the store
right when -PRON- walk in
very convenient for when -PRON- know -PRON- be go to need to brave these narrow aisle with a cart
there be even a little sit area with table and a television
con
the seating area be full of parking lot people and often stink to high hell
also people do not seem to get not leave -PRON- cart right in the way so if -PRON- enter and head towards the produce there will likely be cart which have be leave right in the way

in all -PRON- be a dump
but -PRON- be a bit of a food desert over there aj 's do not count for grocery
so -PRON- guess if -PRON- need to grab a gallon of milk and have a few buck for a guy who be try to catch the bus to get across town and can spare ten dollar to help some lady out with -PRON- -PRON- do not know probably liquor then -PRON- will have a good time at bad fry 's
great location
erick be so sweet generous and care for every customer
-PRON- know when -PRON- walk in -PRON- will be smile
what a great asset to the entire company
-PRON- have be to a good number of phsyiotherapist for problem -PRON- have with -PRON- back and wrist
-PRON- swear to -PRON- not one of -PRON- have do as much as isabel do in one session
-PRON- feel like a new -PRON-
-PRON- have a true talent with -PRON- ability to listen and understand what -PRON- need
-PRON- be so sweet and have an amazing personality but when -PRON- get down to business -PRON- better watch out because -PRON- be no joke
-PRON- strength still amaze -PRON- to this day
isabel genuinely care about -PRON- client and want -PRON- to be as healthy and comfortable as possible
-PRON- do not try to sell every package -PRON- have -PRON- give -PRON- what -PRON- need
-PRON- be hard to trust someone that be go to essentially help heal -PRON- but -PRON- have such a positive comfortable space -PRON- can not help but feel comfortable and trust that -PRON- know what -PRON- be do
-PRON- have all ready refer 5 of -PRON- friend anything -PRON- need
-PRON- must try isabel -PRON- do not trust anyone else but -PRON-

-PRON- touch -PRON- first gun at the end of october at gvr -PRON- husband
and -PRON- sign up for a membership about 3 4 week later and take -PRON- -PRON- ccw course with john b this past saturday 12\/17
-PRON- be terrify of gun prior to 2-month ago
everyone at the range from marcus jerry john wolf and everyone on both the public and club side be very friendly and welcome to both local and out town guest
-PRON- be worth the drive to avoid the hype of the strip
the rental gun be clean well maintain and safety be a priority
-PRON- have use the gun rental option as a way to consider a new conceal gun purchase for -PRON-
as a woman -PRON- can say that -PRON- be 100 comfortable come in to shoot on -PRON- own at this facility
-PRON- son love come in to watch -PRON- shoot the free donut be a bonus and -PRON- will soon be join -PRON- on the range after -PRON- take the kid 's class that gvr offer
the good sunday pool party ever
-PRON- have get see -PRON- for -PRON-
-PRON- visit arizona and happen to be in the area
so -PRON- stop by and check out this place
first of all when -PRON- come inside -PRON- first impression be this place be very spacious and very dark
-PRON- have pool table and -PRON- think more than one bar
-PRON- order the oggie the traditional pasty
steak potato onion rutabaga swede with a side of red wine gravy or ketchup which be recommend by the server
the taste be not bad the crust be crispy -PRON- think this be the secret
but -PRON- think -PRON- really lack of meat
-PRON- also order a glass of saved red blend red wine during happy hour which -PRON- think the server forget to deduct $ 1 from the price
no offense but in -PRON- honest opinion -PRON- think -PRON- mom make more delicious pasty than cornish 's
-PRON- have a pool fence instal in May
marty and dane be awesome
-PRON- explain everything make sure -PRON- have all of -PRON- question answer and leave everything clean and tidy
the fence be amazing and so easy to use
thank -PRON- for an excellent experience -PRON- will definitely recommend -PRON- to everyone
-PRON- be expect to like this place more
-PRON- have a good amount of seating and be clean
-PRON- be seat and approach nearly immediately for -PRON- drink order
so that be a nice start
to eat -PRON- have the chicken fry steak breakfast with biscuit and gravy substitute for the toast
the gravy have a lot of sausage in -PRON- but lack season overall
-PRON- pepper -PRON- up pretty good and -PRON- be not half bad
-PRON- would say with season -PRON- could be an above average pepper cream gravy
but the lack of seasoning be apparent
the biscuit be good but -PRON- could not finish -PRON-
the bottom half be too tough to cut so -PRON- only have a part of -PRON-
the top half that be not too hard be a solid biscuit
the chicken fry steak be a decent diner style version
-PRON- be a lot of food but -PRON- do not think -PRON- be homemade
the spud be similar to omelet house 's version of this dish as many yelper note
-PRON- would agree that these be good -PRON- be large and nearly all fully fry
there be no soggy one which can be annoying at oh
but like the gravy there be not nearly enough seasoning
so -PRON- end up tasting like ketchup hot sauce salt and pepper which be what -PRON- use to season -PRON-
overall -PRON- be a solid value but -PRON- be not blow away
wonderful brunch menu
the egg be cook to perfection and the portion be generous
of all the year -PRON- have be visit -PRON- have find this place to be amazingly consistent place to go to for wonton noodle
service be always astoundingly fast and the food be also delicious
although the one thing -PRON- moderately dislike although -PRON- have generally come to accept about the presentation be that the noodle be generally place on top of the wonton while -PRON- do not look as pretty compare to put the wonton on top this presentation style be more functional as -PRON- allow the noodle to not become soggy as fast so -PRON- get that nice bite
definitely an awesome place to eat at would definitely recommend and -PRON- will be back
-PRON- be generally not much fond of writing review
-PRON- recently move to phoenix after stay in omaha ne for about an year
go for the grocery shopping and see a restaurant right by the side decide to have -PRON- dinner too as -PRON- hardly have energy to cook -PRON- -PRON-
well -PRON- can imagine that the food impress -PRON- that much that -PRON- have to open -PRON- laptop and write this review
when -PRON- say food be the good -PRON- compare -PRON- food with the various indian restaurant -PRON- try while at omaha
this be as authentic and close to punjabi flavour as -PRON- can get in -PRON- understanding in a foreign land
while -PRON- agree with chelsea w the owner and staff be not as professional but -PRON- believe -PRON- not rudeness or any color\/race differentiation as -PRON- suggest but this be because -PRON- be very normal indian people who be shy and not absorb into the american mannerism yet
that be in fact another thing which make e feel home
-PRON- would be go there more frequently
this 1 star rating be not so much about the quality of the massage -PRON- receive but about the shady business practice
-PRON- receive a mediocre 45 minute foot massage which be more of a 40 minute scalp facial hand arm leg and 5 minute foot massage
-PRON- gladly pay -PRON- $ 30 leave -PRON- service provider a cash tip and then 1 week later a charge for $ 40 appear on -PRON- bank statement
that should never never never happen
if -PRON- go here use cash only
if -PRON- be go to go to a semi strip bar on the strip to be strip of -PRON- cash -PRON- may as well do -PRON- here
caesar 's will cheekily toe the line of be trashy whilst still remain the epitome of class and the shadow bar be a prime example of that
-PRON- be tongue and cheek titillation lend a little bit of naughtiness to the place and make -PRON- a perfect place to start off a super special date
the drink be pricey but -PRON- know -PRON- be at caesar 's
the decor be classy and comfortable
the flair bartender add a little bit of je ne sai quio if -PRON- be into that whole flair thing
-PRON- also offer a select tapas menu
-PRON- be a good place to start or end a night
the burger be awesome
there be three of -PRON- and -PRON- enjoy -PRON- food
-PRON- have the bandito burger foo foo fry fantastic
would recommend -PRON- to anyone
this be a brand new place that -PRON- try on a thursday night
the food be good
the pork belly lollypop be a good choice
the service be decent though there be a couple of wrinkle that -PRON- need to work out but -PRON- be not a deal breaker
the value be good as well -PRON- be a nice stop if -PRON- be do multiple venue in downtown chandler
-PRON- be disappoint
because of the location this restaurant try to feel high end but -PRON- be actually quite average
the portion be small and bland
the good hobby shop in town
lot of part and if -PRON- do not have -PRON- can have -PRON- the next day in most case
the staff be very helpful and -PRON- will help -PRON- out on anything -PRON- need do
this buffet in the caesars palace hotel be suppose to be the best buffet in vegas so -PRON- expectation be up there
the setting be very elegant and the display be lovely but this be definitely not worth the cost for -PRON-
there be oyster on the half shell from washington state if -PRON- be a big pacific oyster lover then the price would be justify
there be also king crab leg which -PRON- find a bit dry and stringy
the shrimp be very large plump and tasty
italian food be nothing special
the waitress say the pasta be homemade -PRON- could choose ingredient to have toss with the pasta but the pasta do not appear homemade
lasagna be so so
the chinese offering have nothing particularly special
-PRON- do enjoy the prime rib nice and rare
the lamb chop be overdo
there be an all -PRON- can drink option for wine and beer extra charge
service be very good
drink be fill and plate be clear promptly
this buffet be a little nice than other but for -PRON- the quality do not warrant the very high price
-PRON- would not go back
$ 291 for party of 5
65 min wait then additional 30 on another wait time for -PRON- table
so if -PRON- be patient enough then come on down and give -PRON- a try
mediocre pizza at good that taste like -PRON- be be sit under lamp for hour
arrive lukewarm and crust be tough
not worth the calorie
may be willing to overlook the less than average pizza if -PRON- be not for the rude dismissive wait staff
service at all stage be slow and unfriendly
when -PRON- 10 year old go to the front counter to get a cookie for dessert with $ 10 bill in hand -PRON- rudely tell -PRON- can not get to -PRON- right now
we're a little busy as -PRON- can see
ironically -PRON- be one of only two family in the restaurant
this place use to be a great family friendly place to go for a quick slice don't know what have happen to -PRON-
but -PRON- will not be return
great poke with 3 choice of protein for just 10 dollar
-PRON- can not beat that
i do not think -PRON- will find -PRON- at any other place
-PRON- just recently relocate from illinois to scottsdale and think -PRON- would have to hunt for a great salon and stylist
-PRON- be wrong
-PRON- stylist jackie be move to scottsdale and will be work -PRON- magic at lora moon
jackie have always do amazing cut and color with -PRON- hair
-PRON- have go from long hair to a pixie with many length in between and many different coloring

very attentive while -PRON- be wait for -PRON- food
introduce -PRON- to the restaurant manager who be very personable -PRON- can tell that -PRON- project -PRON- positive energy to -PRON- staff love hear -PRON- success story
definitely the server contribute greatly to this establishment
-PRON- make -PRON- feel right at home
those -PRON- introduce -PRON- to make -PRON- feel welcome and talk to -PRON- like -PRON- be old friend in -PRON- case old friend of -PRON- parent
4 star for the environment -PRON- be too loud for -PRON-
likely 5 star for the young at heart
this place be very upbeat and busy
the bar have several sport event play
-PRON- go on a friday night and -PRON- have a dj play the top hit song
not a place to go for quiet conversation
there be a patio area but not sure if that be any quieter -PRON- husband want to watch the basketball game at a table vs. the bar
3 star for the blacken fish apparently when -PRON- say blacken -PRON- mean charcoal cook and not season with pepper and other sauce
-PRON- take a bite out of -PRON-
and -PRON- get a mouthfull of char burn fish yuck
the menu should actually stipulate the difference and not leave -PRON- for the waiter or manager to explain
-PRON- be top with 3 shrimp and serve with rice vegetable which be good
-PRON- also have the fried green tomatoes and a side of 1 flapjack -PRON- be absolutely delicious
the chicken breast and waffle be good too
-PRON- do have desert there -PRON- order the peach cobbler and bread pudding that have slice of banana in -PRON-
-PRON- be good
several menu item to choose from
and -PRON- be definitely interested in try other food there
2 3 star for the cocktail
order the melon mojito which be just a pricey order of 7-up with mint leaf and the blue ivy seem like -PRON- just serve blue kool aid
-PRON- have a taste of -PRON-
-PRON- be not a big drinker like when -PRON- be blended\/mixed so well that -PRON- can not taste the alcohol
but -PRON- could usually tell if there be at least something
1 star for parking
hard to find parking in -PRON- very small parking lot
most if -PRON- be for the hotel guest next door
-PRON- do get busy and large party will likely have to wait
-PRON- do not take any reservation but -PRON- can order ahead for take out
fast service delicious food and excellent price
-PRON- have be eat at saigon for about eight year and highly recommend -PRON- if -PRON- enjoy vietnamese food
the service be very prompt
-PRON- food usually come within minute of order and -PRON- be delicious
the waitress be friendly
and lunch for two be usually around $ 15
newbie advice
-PRON- be very busy during the lunch rush hour so get there early
the decor be not the fine but -PRON- be the food -PRON- will be eat
fish sauce may not smell great but -PRON- be so so tasty
not a big pho pronounce fawh fan
try the char grill shrimp and beef over rice stir fry white onion noodle with chicken or lemon grass chicken over rice spicy
the vietnamese spring roll be also delicious
-PRON- all be love this place to start interesting menu unique topping great app good wine list great atmosphere friendly waitress -PRON- be just disappointing when -PRON- pizza come
-PRON- order a build -PRON- own pizza with pesto prosciutto basil and arguala -PRON- sound amazing -PRON- have have similar pizza before
but the pizza come out with tomato sauce as -PRON- will and only a few dab of pesto and a few slice of cook bacon like prosciutto
-PRON- think the pesto would be in place of tomato sauce
the tomato and heap of arguala drown out the pesto basil and prosciutto
-PRON- just could have be do better this place be about to be 5 star one of the great then -PRON- disappoint bummer
so thirteen year creep up pretty quick in a marriage
thankfully -PRON- wife be not high maintenance
-PRON- request that for -PRON- anniversary that -PRON- just try someplace -PRON- have not be before for a really good bar burger
so -PRON- turn -PRON- fellow cleveland yelper and start read -PRON- review
-PRON- want to stay close to home
so -PRON- focus around the strongsville area
after read lot of review of several place -PRON- opt for mike 's
the review -PRON- read be wonderful
but -PRON- truly be the uploaded photo that make up -PRON- mind
-PRON- park in the public parking lot and walk over to the bar
this place be pretty small inside but well keep and very clean
-PRON- stroll in about 6:15 on a saturday night and only have to wait about five minute for a table
the place be pack
there be also a private party go on in the upper room from the entrance
despite all the craziness of the packed restaurant and a private party go on the service be excellent
-PRON- have an extensive beer list
-PRON- be always nice to have more than three or four choice
wife and -PRON- both order burger
nothing fancy
when -PRON- see other table order come from the kitchen -PRON- instantly like what -PRON- see
-PRON- burger come out relatively quick and be cook to perfection
mike 's be a solid four star burger joint
-PRON- even have a kid menu so the wife and -PRON- will be bring -PRON- son the next time -PRON- go
as an espresso snob -PRON- have be wait for a great espresso bar to open in bloor west village
so -PRON- do not have to make the trek to crema in the junction
so -PRON- be super excited when wibke 's open just around the corner from -PRON- house
-PRON- have not try wibke 's espresso yet but -PRON- latte be good to great
-PRON- baked good be amazing
-PRON- be a rare week that -PRON- can survive without one of -PRON- airy croissant
the croissant 's be so good
-PRON- have not venture to try -PRON- other goody which look amazing especially the various loafs
as other have mention the small size of the espresso bar and the friendly owner create a great neighborly atmosphere
if not for -PRON- last time at the preserve -PRON- would give five star
on -PRON- last visit -PRON- go there with -PRON- wife and out of town brother
the three of -PRON- have a bad experience upon entry and exit
upon entry there be no one at the front desk so -PRON- sign in like always and go outside
once outside a rude man confront -PRON- and want to know if -PRON- have sign in
-PRON- say yes
then -PRON- ask for -PRON- address
-PRON- think that be strange but tell -PRON- anyway
-PRON- say -PRON- would try to remember and off -PRON- go
all three of -PRON- think this guy be very negative
when exit through the visitor center the same guy say okay what -PRON- be go to need from -PRON- be
-PRON- say something like -PRON- do not think so and walk out the door
-PRON- brother follow
-PRON- wife be the person -PRON- be stay behind and apparently give -PRON- what -PRON- want
for the record -PRON- have never have to give -PRON- address for something like this and consider -PRON- an invasion of privacy
-PRON- certainly ought not be a requirement
now have say all that have the man be kind and explain why -PRON- want -PRON- address -PRON- probably would have gladly share
make such a demand in such a rude way i.e. what -PRON- need from -PRON- do not cut -PRON-
otherwise -PRON- be a great place
-PRON- two friend and -PRON- be so horribly disappointed
this be -PRON- 1000th show and -PRON- birthday
-PRON- be seat near the president of luxor and miss nevada and other celebs be allegedly in the audience
-PRON- would have think -PRON- would go all out
not so
-PRON- would expect some cirque component
very very little
-PRON- say -PRON- be different all the time
thank goodness
-PRON- hope some people be able to enjoy a good show
jokes be so canned and campy
not funny
trick be just meh
this one be such a let down
if -PRON- go get the cheapest bad seat possible because -PRON- may be a decent show if -PRON- be way in the back and can not see well
bland as bland can be -PRON- do not know how this place will be able to keep up with the other great restaurant in the flat
also the decor be horrible
-PRON- get -PRON- be go for the old school rock and roll dinner feel
but there be a right way to do that and there be a wrong way
what -PRON- do be the wrong way
too expensive and no flavor
bad combination there be
-PRON- may drive down east wash and never even notice this place
but -PRON- be a gem
great food strong server
-PRON- new menu be really delicious
-PRON- have a beautiful house salad and fry mac and cheese bite and be delight by both pick

stay at trump on nye
like many other review book by priceline get a great rate consider rate anywhere in vegas on nye
the room be super nice well appoint with vast storage space fabulous bathroom with a great jacuzzi tub which the girlfriend love equip with a fully functional mini kitchen and just plain big
great place to stay just off the strip near the wynn\/ encore
not too far from treasure island palazzo venetian mirage caesar 's palace but far enough to be quiet restful when -PRON- actually want to sleep
there be 2 complaint however valet only parking a crazy fee for internet in the room
really
there be numerous roach motel with free wifi but not the trump
oh well all thing consider -PRON- would likely stay again
-PRON- just do not understand how luxury do not include internet
this place be a little piece of ethiopian heaven
to start the injera bread be huge and so delicious -PRON- could eat -PRON- for day
the ethiopian salad be so tasty and the jalapeño give -PRON- a little kick
-PRON- have the cabbage and collard both cook to perfection
can not beat the price for the amount of food
will definitely be come back
a lot
wow
this safeway have both a starbucks and a jamba juice
-PRON- would never see both drink place in a safeway back in northern california
in addition there be also a gelato corner
mmmm
-PRON- be tempt by the creme brulee tiramisu burgundy cherry and sorbet flavor
luckily -PRON- say no since that would be a unhealthy meal for lunch
if a gelato section be in -PRON- neighborhood safeway -PRON- would go all the time and gain 10 pound in a year from all that gelato
price for gelato + small $ 2.99 + regular $ 3.99 + pint $ 5.49 -PRON- can also get sample but -PRON- do not want to ask for any
-PRON- be seat immediately on a busy evening nice environment incredible sushi and great service
the server dress as geishas the only thing that bum -PRON- out be that -PRON- be not all -PRON- can eat however -PRON- compensate by have a tremendous menu
highly recommend
fantastic intro workshop
-PRON- really enjoy -PRON- time and can not wait to go back to learn more
-PRON- have to start by say -PRON- create this account specifically for this review
that be how displeased -PRON- be with -PRON- most recent customer service experience at this particular location
-PRON- have always enjoy breakfast here on -PRON- off day because -PRON- be on the corner of -PRON- home however the young lady and the gentleman obvious a new employee be horrible this afternoon
-PRON- actually have an amazing morning and decide to stop by -PRON- favorite shop for breakfast
when enter -PRON- be never greet even though -PRON- be one of 2 customer which have never happen -PRON- always receive a warm greeting
-PRON- actually do not let -PRON- detour -PRON- because -PRON- be in such a good mood
however the employee be not
the young lady be train and -PRON- make -PRON- well know by point out every little thing the young man do wrong in front of the customer and with a horrible attitude at that
not the characteristics of someone who know how to be a leader
poor young man be so soft speak when ask -PRON- to speak up because -PRON- can hardly hear -PRON- snap with a quick question back at -PRON-
the young lady make -PRON- feel so un welcome and as if -PRON- bother -PRON- with question of a new sand which -PRON- be try this time
-PRON- would have to say -PRON- be truly disappointed in this experience and the tempo and atmosphere of there afternoon worker should seriously be look into
-PRON- just have elsa out for -PRON- 2 yo birthday party
candice be amazing
-PRON- be great with the little kid and super sweet to everyone
-PRON- do face or arm for nervous kid painting sing and even bring -PRON- daughter a nice gift for -PRON- birthday
-PRON- really can not say enough about -PRON-
and -PRON- hope -PRON- daughter want another princess or superhero party in the future
so -PRON- can hire -PRON- again
price be low than -PRON- expect to so very happy all around
so -PRON- come here back in december with -PRON- bf and another couple
-PRON- be on -PRON- way back home before stop here to eat
-PRON- remember come here before but could not remember if -PRON- be good or not and the other couple be want to come here very badly
so hey -PRON- stop and -PRON- be not disappoint at all
-PRON- have everything here
-PRON- have not have hush puppy in over 8 yrs and the one -PRON- have here be amazing
oh and -PRON- have the sunday brunch unlimited mimosa
man mimosa be the cure to hangover
lol
-PRON- and -PRON- bf be the only one who order the mimosa but -PRON- be the only one throw -PRON- back.lol by the time -PRON- be on my4th -PRON- bf be finish -PRON- first
the waiter be so polite and do not mind have to keep come back to refill -PRON- cup -PRON- find -PRON- pretty funny that -PRON- be just drink and drinking.lol
awesome waiter and great food
incredibly friendly group of barista and roaster
the food be delicious
the coffee good around
never have have a disappointing experience
could not have improve the asian food experience much in the restaurant nestle into an upscale outdoor mall
starter starter be a chang 's mai tai and ahi poke bowl
-PRON- be the envy of other diner some of which give -PRON- unsolicited opinion that be the good thing here
after guest arrive -PRON- test the theory order the kung pao dragon roll
great
but not as good as poke
ditto kung pao chicken and lobster shrimp rice
service be top noch if a little weird respond with yes excellent excellent choice
after any request may -PRON- have more water
yes excellent excellent choice
really
-PRON- have be to -PRON- fair share of brazilian steakhouse in a few different place
first with the good the service be awesome from the hostess to -PRON- waitress to all the gentleman that come and offer -PRON- the different cut of meat
everyone have a smile on -PRON- face and when -PRON- respond in spanish -PRON- speak back to -PRON- in spanish and make -PRON- feel welcome
there be a variety of cut and -PRON- try lamb garlic sirloin tri tip bacon wrap filet mignon and pork
now the bad there be 12 cut of meat offer but in the hour -PRON- take -PRON- and -PRON- sister to finish -PRON- bottle of wine the tri tip come to -PRON- table about 7 time the other cut would rarely circulate
-PRON- have to ask for the lamb and garlic sirloin to be bring out but -PRON- seem that some cut be not bring out unless request
the salad bar be a bit messy but the cheese bread be delicious
the ambience be satisfactory but the noise level drown out any music the restaurant may have be play but -PRON- feel like -PRON- may not even have any dinner music
-PRON- just have possibly the good meal -PRON- have ever have at spago in the forum shops at ceasar 's palace
-PRON- live near l.a.
so -PRON- have always hear of the spago here and how amazing -PRON- be
but -PRON- have never be there
so this weekend -PRON- fiancee and -PRON- decide to splurge a little and end up try the tasting menu at spago
all -PRON- can say be yum
each course be small but delicious
-PRON- try thing -PRON- never would have order and -PRON- be so glad -PRON- do
-PRON- would say the three good course be the apple salad the black truffle oil spaghettini and the braised spare ribs
-PRON- all melt in -PRON- mouth
the service be great
-PRON- be seat right away without a reservation
plus -PRON- can get the full menu sit out on the patio or cafe side
several time thoughout -PRON- meal the chef come out to check on -PRON-
at the end -PRON- give -PRON- a great big thank
-PRON-
-PRON- be a new convert to taste menu
try all the chef 's specialty at once then -PRON- will know what to order next time
-PRON- be expensive but the splurge be worth -PRON- once in a while

rude snotty and far from thorough be the first word that come to mind
dr lorio act bother when -PRON- ask in depth question surround the very peel -PRON- recommend and tell -PRON- -PRON- do not do peel so -PRON- would need to talk to -PRON- assistant
do -PRON- direct -PRON- to -PRON- assistant
no -PRON- tell -PRON- to make an appointment and send -PRON- on -PRON- way
-PRON- be shock by how uppity a so call professional would treat a patient
a horrible unprofessional experience
will not be go back ever
-PRON- be a new patient and -PRON- be -PRON- first time here
-PRON- wait for an hour and a half
-PRON- be sorry but one hour and thirty minute be such a horrible first impression that -PRON- get up and cancel -PRON- appointment
-PRON- have not even be see yet after that long so
-PRON- can not imagine the doctor would be the type to put thoughtful care into -PRON- time with -PRON-
that give -PRON- the impression that -PRON- double book patient or even quadruple book just for the money
plus the tiny waiting area be packed
-PRON- almost could not find a seat to sit and be sandwich between two young teenager who be relate and both have toddler on -PRON- lap
-PRON- decide to have a conversation between each other while -PRON- sit between -PRON-
awkward
not to mention -PRON- be fill with kid
-PRON- guess -PRON- miss the memo that this be a primary provider for child and not so much adult
-PRON- be find another dentist
-PRON- often come here for a fine sea food dining
-PRON- seafood be always fresh and declious
highly recommend
terrible service
sell a battery with a warranty on a battery -PRON- do not sell
highly irritate and fraudulent
will never get -PRON- business again
portion size be obviously more than adequate
food be delicious when -PRON- be hungry
however when -PRON- be just somewhat hungry the taste be a little on the plain side
that overwhelming feeling of -PRON- could have make this at home take over
this be definitely a place to experience and take guest for the wow factor but not somewhere -PRON- would go to more than once every two month or so
-PRON- be great for young kid
for teenager meh
much of the stuff be gear towards the young scientist
definitely a good fit for young kid but a maybe for the old one especially with the science centre kind of far away from the centre of the city
amazing sicilian pizza mozzarella stick and to die for garlic knot
also a delicatessen where -PRON- can buy drink deli meat and countless pasta sauce dessert other amazing thing
off the strip and in a relaxing less hectic environment which be a big plu

-PRON- highly recommend -PRON- for all -PRON- jewelry need and -PRON- pricing be very reasonable
lovely time dining in a beautiful set overlook the gold course
delicious mexican chicken salad
cinnamon mini roll be decadent
das ist essen ist ok aber für die moderne küche viel zu schwer und mächtig
zu viel
öl und fett creme brülee war leider ein ungenießbarer warm pudding mit zuckerkruste
tomatensuppe überwürzt und kratzig -PRON- be hal
preise sind in ordnung
die bedienung war fleißig und freundlich
insgesamt ist das lokal für einfache ansprüche
ala schwäbisch gasthaus ok und akzeptabel
ich werde nicht noch mal hingehen und kann es nicht empfehlen
i absolutely love this place
-PRON- be always a for sure option for a great deli meal
-PRON- be in love with the matzo ball soup and the rueben sandwich be also a fave of mine
-PRON- friend and -PRON- always stay at encore and make -PRON- a point to hit up zooza
-PRON- have the manhattan clam chowder this past weekend
and -PRON- too be amazing
-PRON- be still the big fan of the matzo but a girl have to branch out a bit
michele with one l
be horrible 1 star service
-PRON- can not read mind
like duh -PRON- expect that as customer
the food make up for -PRON- lack of telepathic ability though
so 5 star just kid all joke aside this be perhaps the good sushi spot in town or at minimum be rank very high up there
the service be unquestionably great and even on a busy night whether -PRON- be michele or aileen that end up help -PRON- good friend and -PRON- -PRON- end up give nothing but praise for how outstanding -PRON- be to -PRON-
that go for the sushi chef and the owner -PRON-
indeed all a part of a win ensemble
now let -PRON- talk sushi
rice hold -PRON- have good size fish cut -PRON- be tasty and incredibly fresh
have not have any fresher in this town
-PRON- and -PRON- bud be nigeri aficionado and indulge in tuna yellowtail salmon tasty i.m.o. red snapper super white surf clam and uni
the latter two be in -PRON- opinion the good in this town
-PRON- have experience bad uni and surf clam before but never here
oh and the sashimi roll be ridiculous
5 star through and through
above and beyond five star -PRON- have severe neuropathic pain from type ii diabetes in -PRON- foot
-PRON- be look at those expensive specialists that advertise everywhere and -PRON- treatment be either medication or a tense unit electrical stimulation
know that this be what chiropractor do for back and neck pain and have research the process plus know first hand patient in other state
-PRON- start look for a chiropractor
-PRON- search lead -PRON- to dr. hogan
-PRON- could not be more pleased with this excellent care doctor
-PRON- can finally sleep at night again without the feeling of hundred of needle jab -PRON- foot at once nor the feeling of have spot on -PRON- foot ready to catch on fire
-PRON- be hop to eventually reduce -PRON- medication however for -PRON- just have a good night sleep be incredible
where oh where do -PRON- damn start
-PRON- come here with a friend of mine before head out to celebrate -PRON- birthday
-PRON- dunno why -PRON- do not just go to midnight diner
but hey -PRON- be -PRON- birthday
not -PRON-
first there be a $ 5 cover
not bad
rent get to be pay so -PRON- get -PRON-
upon observation one could easily tell that this be a place for the maw maw 's and paw paw 's of the world
and this be not necessarily a bad thing
-PRON- just know that none of -PRON- will be at church in the morning
anyway -PRON- both decide to order a tequila sunrise
google -PRON- and -PRON- will see that -PRON- be a fairly easy drink to make
do not take much effort at all
the only problem be the bartender do this age old trick where the bottom be fill with water first and then liquor be add on top of that
-PRON- know right then and there -PRON- should have carry -PRON- ass on home but again -PRON- birthday not -PRON-
-PRON- decide to order the crawfish egg roll
-PRON- have have different egg roll before so the fact that -PRON- manage to roll some crawfish in seem like -PRON- would be impressive
chile
-PRON- put a single crawfish tail in each egg roll the appetizer come with two and the rest be cabbage
nothing but raw cabbage
oh but -PRON- get bad
-PRON- serve -PRON- with some type of pepper jam and when -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- would rather eat the placenta of rabid dog -PRON- be not exaggerate
-PRON- be disgusting
-PRON- decide to fix -PRON- face
even though -PRON- be bat on two negative -PRON- figure that maybe the main course would be good
so -PRON- order the catfish fry and rice and bean
-PRON- have crab mac and cheese but after the crawfish egg roll -PRON- be not here for -PRON-
-PRON- also have collard green and honestly -PRON- be cool on eat anyone 's collard that be not -PRON- mama
so heavy carb -PRON- be
the fry be freeze orida
the red bean and rice be a can of over salted kidney bean with white rice on top
and the fish be not cook all the way through
-PRON- be sure that if -PRON- be read this far -PRON- be wonder how -PRON- handle -PRON- right
-PRON- talk to the waitress and tell -PRON- that -PRON- be irritated by the food and service
-PRON- -PRON- all serve -PRON- drink that have a smooth 2 3 inch of water in -PRON- before -PRON- add the alcohol
-PRON-
-PRON- be sorry
when -PRON- bring out the receipt for payment -PRON- be a little annoyed at the price and say this be seriously not good
-PRON- be not one to complain about stuff
but this be the cost
and nothing be good
waitress -PRON- pay for yall coke
and that be when -PRON- lose -PRON-
so right now -PRON- be stand at the door wait for a manager
-PRON- be sure he\/she be not go to do sh*t
and -PRON- be go to end up in meck
county before the night be over
-PRON- do not even want a refund a discount nothing
-PRON- just want him\/her to see this face and understand that -PRON- absolutely be the type stand in -PRON- establishment and write a dissertation style yelp review because -PRON- have time and type well over 90 word per minute
update
the manager apologize for the whole deal
-PRON- definitely appreciate -PRON- but not enough to come back
y'all have fun with that
the food be over price bar food
-PRON- order the queen cut prime rib $ 26 could not finish -PRON- because -PRON- be so tough
the cheap $ 12.99 prime rib dinner downtown be good
-PRON- do not come here often but when -PRON- do -PRON- be remind why -PRON- do not
love pinkbox
go for the first time for -PRON- bday and could not have be happy with the choice
-PRON- can not imagine give this place anything other than a five star review
a super friendly staff that keep the line move and be very helpful and delicious donut
good sprinkle chocolate donut -PRON- have ever have
could not believe the massive selection and sup affordable price
definitely worth break -PRON- diet for
-PRON- be not go to pretend to be a coffee connoisseur but -PRON- be a caffeine addict as well as a coffee shop lover
cute cafés be -PRON- jam
jimmy 's coffee be a very average experience however
jimmy 's use the unsweetened almond milk from silk which be horrible because the unsweetened version taste incredibly salty and this definitely transfer to the taste of -PRON- almond milk latte
-PRON- use a rather acidic strain of coffee bean re sour and the double shot macchiato be hard to swallow
also no latte art
whaaaaat
the barista use some hand motion that make -PRON- look like -PRON- be do latte art but in reality -PRON- look like a white unidentifiable blob in the middle of -PRON- tiny cup of coffee
there be three floor yet there be zero place to sit down
the third floor have a conference room style table the second floor with a hodgepodge assortment of furniture and the first floor have a severe lack of chair
good luck try to enjoy -PRON- coffee inside
jimmy 's coffee be an alright café and -PRON- may drop by to try -PRON- other item
however -PRON- will not make a special trip for jimmy 's because there be good shop in -PRON- neighborhood thank
so winterlicious prompt a friend and -PRON- to finally try this place after month of want to check -PRON- out
upon -PRON- arrival -PRON- note that the restaurant be far fancy than -PRON- have anticipate so -PRON- be excited to start eat
-PRON- decide to deviate from the winterlicious menu by start with an order of guacamole
mixed with pomegranate the guac be serve with just a handful of fresh nachos
this paucity of chip do not deter from what be otherwise a very tasty plate of guacamole with the sweetness of the pomegranate certainly an innovative and delicious innovation
-PRON- be disappointing that -PRON- be not give more nachos though as -PRON- be force to eat the remainder of the guac with a fork
not the classiest move admittedly but -PRON- be not go to let any of -PRON- go to waste
okay so the winterlicious menu
-PRON- start with the pozole de cerdo y camaron which be a soup contain pull pork shrimp corn oregano and macha oil
the presentation be very pretty to be sure but the soup be just average at good
there be nothing specifically wrong with -PRON- the pull pork be soft and plentiful for example and yet there be also nothing mind blow about -PRON- either
-PRON- taste like a soup -PRON- could have have at panera or some other fast food type place
expectation be high for the main which be the ropa vieja brisket pico de gallo egg chayote and tostadas
again the presentation be top notch but the food be just so so
aside from be an almost comically tiny portion the brisket and -PRON- accompanying ingredient be very run of the mill and average
admittedly the meat be very soft and tender but the dish be nothing to get terribly excited about
the word mediocre be practically invent to describe this ropa vieja
finally the dessert arrive
-PRON- go with the gelatina de rompope which be a rum flavour jello
at the risk of sound like a broken record the dish be adequate but nothing exceptional
-PRON- be actually a fairly frustrating end to a consistently middle meal
-PRON- should note that -PRON- dining companion feel the same way about the food
give the cost and average food -PRON- simply can not recommend los colibris to anyone
and -PRON- certainly will not be return
-PRON- stay here over the 4th of july holiday and can not wait to do so again
-PRON- be greet by friendly staff member and the experience be a great one from start to finish

and then i can tar and feather -PRON- while -PRON- be here
problem
3-
-PRON- buy -PRON- receiver however
-PRON- show that -PRON- pay $ 99 and that be the rental price
hmmmmm-
-PRON- bank account again show that -PRON- pay much more than that
problem
4-
instead of credit -PRON- for the invisible rental receiver -PRON- claim -PRON- have -PRON- have be credit -PRON- the rental charge for the receiver -PRON- own
ummmm no
not only do i need to be credit rental charge for the fake invisible receiver but also the rental charge for the receiver -PRON- own
but -PRON- think -PRON- rent
problem
5-
-PRON- keep get charge late fees-
like -PRON- say the money come right out of -PRON- account
problem
6- -PRON- hd channel stop work during the 90 day service warranty period so someone have to come out
-PRON- charge -PRON- for that too
-PRON- take a 2 hr phone call to get -PRON- reverse
problem
7- i just open -PRON- bill and repeat problem 1 6
still not resolve after 3 phone call
this place be nothing but problem
i do not care how much -PRON- like the set up of the guide i will never use directv again
i can put up with -PRON- if i do not have a problem every month and be force to talk to these people
-PRON- just can not seem to do simple billing
get an excellent salad to go and a sparkling water
thought -PRON- be great that -PRON- ask -PRON- if -PRON- know -PRON- be sparkle water instead of flat
-PRON- know -PRON- may sound weird but -PRON- look the same as flat waster so -PRON- appreciate the time -PRON- take to make sure -PRON- grab the right item
have eat take out from here at least 50 time more like 100 i suppose but never look at the yelp list until today
-PRON- question the people who do not like -PRON- as in no way have the food ever be anything but great but the way these people act like the food be from mar or something -PRON- have to wonder how honest -PRON- be
even if the food taste bad -PRON- have never see -PRON- anything but cook very well and always fresh and steamy hot when -PRON- get -PRON- home
-PRON- have get -PRON- and bring -PRON- to friend house for meal get many different item and never have anything but great hot food
seem everything be get so expensive these day
but -PRON- usually get enough for two meal so look at -PRON- that way
-PRON- be still a great bargain
overcook potato skin process turkey club dry tasteless salmon
not cheap either
a much need brewery in lawrenceville
seriously
this place be incredible and the owner be just lovely
the decor be repurpos refurbish beautiful wood and metal in a rustic warehouse
the brew be by far the good pour -PRON- have have in a long while
-PRON- fave be the beta series oatmeal stout
so good
in addition to -PRON- own pour -PRON- carry an arsenal cider and an apis mead
this new addition to the city be supreme
-PRON- love this place
-PRON- drive an aston martin
-PRON- teach -PRON- everything -PRON- need to have a fun and safe experience
barry be awesome
help -PRON- through all of -PRON-
a+ for the setting and service
gorgeous location for a date night
as for the food -PRON- be extremely underwhelmed
the lunch menu be very limited
and the choice be not even that appeal
the good dish seem to be the chicken and forbid rice per server 's recommendation
-PRON- mom get this and -PRON- be actually pretty good
-PRON- end up order tomato soup and pasta
the tomato soup be tasty but -PRON- wish -PRON- have tone -PRON- down on the salt
-PRON- have have good at panera
the pasta be so boring
literally just a pink tomato sauce with a dash of basil and cheese on top
now -PRON- understand there be beauty in simplicity but this be just flat out tasteless
-PRON- choose not to order the quiche or crepe to avoid that other review note those item be bland too
for how expensive the dish be -PRON- would think -PRON- could hire good chef or use some more ingredient
-PRON- do have an amazing wine selection
so -PRON- would say if -PRON- be look for somewhere to sit down and share a bottle of wine while overlook a lake fill with beautiful black swan come check this place out
but if -PRON- be look to have an authentic french meal move along
-PRON- love this gym but see lot of racism from management staff yesterday
management dress very unprofessional and out of uniform belittle an asian couple in the pool area make racist statement threaten -PRON- in a humiliating matter -PRON- will be contact corporate this type of behavior be unacceptable
what a disaster
do not do -PRON-
no show multiple time on -PRON-
if -PRON- purchase the living social deal -PRON- can get a refund within 7 day of purchase
after 7 day live social will give -PRON- credit
come here because of the 4 star yelp review
-PRON- be very disappointed
-PRON- -PRON- low carb breakfast and traditional burrito
-PRON- think -PRON- would be tasty but taste like what
denny 's
nothing special
-PRON- expect more flavor but the sauce that -PRON- use for the low carb breakfast do not live up to -PRON- expectation
the seafood at this resturaunt be the furth thing from cajun and that be come from someone with cajun root who be bear and raise in louisiana
this food be a disgrace honestly
never in -PRON- life do i have crawfish boil with heap of garlic like be use at this resturaunt
in fact nobody back home use this much garlic in seafood boil
the amount of garlic use in the fake cajun seasoning be appalling and disgusting clearly use to hide the off flavor of the unfresh seafood
nobody use this much garlic in true cajun dish and eat here will make -PRON- smell like a piece of garlic the next day unauthentic food and way more expensive than what -PRON- worth
the lb of crawfish that i eat would be worth no more than $ 3 back home considering how poorly make -PRON- be
try again on make cajun food and maybe consult with an actual louisianian if -PRON- want to make cajun food
this be so typical of the midw
never go here -PRON- so inauthentic and gross and overprice for what -PRON- get
also fry can not be cajun
dear owner and chef do -PRON- research before -PRON- try cook food that be out of the scope of -PRON- culture and do not misrepresent -PRON- with awful flavor like -PRON- have these first few week of opening
and remove the word cajun from -PRON- marketing as -PRON- be false advertising
fresh and a variety of good sushi
small little japanese place with friendly and knowledgable staff
the seat be not the most comfortable of choice and the coat hanger be by the door no place to put a bag
go for the raman but decide to get a sushi platter to try
the raman be decent but nothing special and the grill salmon rice be good
the good part be the sushi platter
be go to try the assorted sushi but get the deluxe sushi instead because the waitress highly recommend -PRON-
be not disappoint at all presentation be amazing and -PRON- taste great
overall will definitely be back for more sushi platter
since the first time -PRON- come -PRON- have have to take -PRON- son 's jeep back twice for the same reason check engine light
-PRON- have get a nearly $ 2,000 out of -PRON-
when -PRON- send -PRON- back the last time -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- do not know why the light keep come back on and -PRON- should take -PRON- to dealership where -PRON- ask for $ 5,000
that be after this place work on -PRON- twice
-PRON- be leave wonder if -PRON- make -PRON- bad

the couple next to -PRON- get -PRON- and -PRON- look amazing
the nachos and taco be both excellent both make with fresh ingredient from reyna 's
the food menu be much short than the drink menu but -PRON- be ok with that
although -PRON- definitely have a little room to expand -PRON- food offering which would keep -PRON- come back to try different thing hh folks check out the menu at ono kine grindz in milwaukee spamasubi purple rice and more

-PRON- win i.e. lose so much on total reward play two buffet and despite -PRON- practice of never go to buffer -PRON- succumb
le village buffet be le disgusting not to mention the famous french macaron be all purposely make upside down so -PRON- would supposedly sit better on a dish so say a chef in the buffet bakery area
-PRON- mean really macaron are paris why not make -PRON- gorgeously perfect
pop into the cute little pastry shop for a croissant and -PRON- be stale
fine -PRON- decide today be a beautiful day so let -PRON- go sit by the pool which be apparently closed for repair from now until the end of the month
whatev let -PRON- just go sit in the sun and read sit down for literally one minute before attendant say the pool area be now closed 4:00pm
um what
if -PRON- be not for drive thru the desert at night -PRON- would say let just go home
totally disappointing valentine 's day weekend at a hotel -PRON- want to love

um yah! but
chocolate covet strawberry would be nice at this point
-PRON- be a total raman snob

if -PRON- a big sushi lover i would recommend this 100 over any other place
try and compare -PRON- to other sushi place and sushi star will show -PRON- worth -PRON- hand down
-PRON- have be to super burrito a few time
the sign have always catch -PRON- attention
-PRON- mean -PRON- like regular burrito but a super burrito sound better
-PRON- go on -PRON- lunch break and the -PRON- could not make up -PRON- mind
-PRON- mean there be not that many item on the menu
-PRON- be pretty sure -PRON- be go to get a burrito

the guy watch the counter be really helpful
-PRON- make a few suggestion and tell -PRON- what -PRON- sell the most of
-PRON- end up just get the carne asada burrito
-PRON- can not go wrong with grill beef
-PRON- be make pretty fast so if -PRON- be here for lunch do not worry about wait too long
the burrito be a good size
-PRON- be not huge which be ok because -PRON- do not want to fall asleep at -PRON- desk when -PRON- get back
the burrito have a big garlic taste
that be the only thing -PRON- do not like
the taste stay with -PRON- the rest of day
-PRON- be just a little too much
the meat be cook perfect and the tortilla taste good too
-PRON- drown -PRON- in the green salsa -PRON- have
if -PRON- be in the area or on a lunch break -PRON- have to check this place out
-PRON- have a drive thru if -PRON- want to take -PRON- to go
cheers
great pizza
-PRON- sausage and mushroom and the spinach and tomato be amazing
-PRON- do not know how -PRON- make -PRON- sauce
-PRON- be different but definitely very tasty -PRON- highly recommend -PRON-
-PRON- be give -PRON- 5 star because there be no other chinese food here in surprise that match with -PRON-
-PRON- sometimes come in a big party 15 20 but have never wait for more than 15 minute
-PRON- personal favorite be the fish in black bean sauce
-PRON- son love -PRON- orange beef
-PRON- wife love the tofu and eggplant dish
never go to other chinese restaurant in surprise
this place be affordable quiet and the food be always good
-PRON- also help that the service be excellent

thank -PRON- dennis and helen
mykonos be the place to come and enjoy real greek food
opa
sadly this place be sell -PRON- have be back several time and the food and service be no longer the same
-PRON- be too bad
super crowded and warm water not sure if that be a good or bad thing make -PRON- feel a little icky thinking about that when -PRON- be in the water
just one pool and the entire area be not that big
drink and food be incredibly overpriced $ 17 blended margarita
whether -PRON- be order at the bar or if -PRON- have a table
oh and lot and lot of beautiful fake girl in teeny bikinis and sky high stiletto to the poolside and jersey shore type guy oh vegas
oh and get here early
whether -PRON- get in via guestlist or have a cabana or re enter or whatev the baggage check line take forever
which -PRON- check everything do not even bring gum or mint
and without a cabana or day bed -PRON- will be a challenge to find a safe spot to put -PRON- stuff down
-PRON- still think rehab be good
-PRON- check out the small bite serve at the bubble bar before decide if -PRON- should venture the tasting menu
the artichoke soup with truffle be tasty and the scallop two way saute and sashimi be melt in mouth yummy
the lobster salad be eeehh
-PRON- do not think -PRON- will be check out -PRON- tasting menu base on -PRON- small bite experience
interesting place in whitby
limited menu but what -PRON- have be good food
pretty busy for late dinner
return to nostrano last night with part of the lady progressive dinner
-PRON- pick nostrano because of the excellent experience that -PRON- have before
this time -PRON- be embarrassed that -PRON- suggest the place
while the dessert be as good as -PRON- remember -PRON- the service be odd and occasionally downright rude
-PRON- server do not know the menu and all -PRON- be have be dessert and drink
-PRON- could not answer question about drink such as what be this
-PRON- recommend a drink for another in -PRON- party and describe -PRON- as smooth and extremely palatable
when -PRON- arrive -PRON- be anything but smooth instead -PRON- be extremely medicinal and sharp
this be fine if that be what -PRON- be expect but -PRON- be not
-PRON- also have people in -PRON- party that have some dietary restriction and -PRON- be really unaccommodating
for example -PRON- order the affogato and ask to go easy on the espresso as -PRON- be pregnant
-PRON- tell -PRON- flat out no
-PRON- ask -PRON- if -PRON- be serious and -PRON- say yes
-PRON- do offer to serve -PRON- on the side however -PRON- be just stunned
for such a lovely establishment to be so unaccommodating
-PRON- be more like the service that -PRON- would get a dick 's last resort
-PRON- know where -PRON- pay -PRON- to be mean to -PRON-
when -PRON- have be to nostrano on a weekend night when -PRON- be much busy -PRON- have receive exceptional service
-PRON- seem as if -PRON- have -PRON- b squad out on week night
-PRON- be still disappointed think about -PRON-
in short -PRON- feel like an inconvenience the entire time -PRON- be there
and like -PRON- do not want -PRON- business
a very good chain restaurant
-PRON- much prefer -PRON- to outback logan 's or texas roadhouse
-PRON- have to comment on the previous post only because all that one need to do be click on the website look at the menu and see that every burger on the menu include fry or cole slaw and cost either 10.00 or 10.50
not really sure what -PRON- be that motivate some reviewer
-PRON- decide to make a 2nd visit today for lunch
get there at noon which be 1 hr into lunch
again a fail to -PRON-
the chicken selection seem try
the steak cut in strip where okay with a mix of med and well do
the mexican selection be lack
the lasagna be cold
-PRON- order some customer pasta dish in which be be soak in olive oil and the add chicken be still cold plus i have to wait about 5 min for someone to attend the station
no one be at the carving station but food present
never try turkey as -PRON- do not have all day since -PRON- be here for a convention at the hotel
also sp many dish last a proper clean legible description
-PRON- do not eat pork and some dish -PRON- be not sure in the chinese area
-PRON- guess -PRON- last day will be a different resturant as the buffet be really lack quality proper display for dish name and just the fresh taste
even the watermelon cut up look like -PRON- be do 2 or 3 day ago as -PRON- have that sit in fridge look
-PRON- have have good experiance every time -PRON- have go -PRON- a little pricey but worth the price for -PRON- chicken and sauce
the drive through be always busy but if -PRON- go inside -PRON- can get -PRON- food pretty quick
along with that if -PRON- be busy -PRON- know -PRON- food will be hot and tasty d.
-PRON- can not wait to return to vegas to rent a car again
-PRON- get a lamborghini gallardo and everything be perfect
the car be bad@$$ and super clean
-PRON- have the time of -PRON- life
unlimited mile and no bs
-PRON- be super helpful too
-PRON- read about this shop in the arizona republic
from the write up -PRON- sort of expect red hot robot to carry a selection of vintage era or theme robot toy
pretty cool
when -PRON- get there -PRON- just learn that the place be a kid robot clone only not
the selection be sparse and -PRON- just do not see the point
-PRON- be probably be too harsh though
to have any place in phoenix where -PRON- may find a limited edition bearbrick for instance be nice
-PRON- just wonder how successful this place can really be in this city
-PRON- probably help that -PRON- be next door to stinkweeds though
this place be amazing
the food be so healthy at least appear to be and the menu have so much to -PRON-
-PRON- have the chicken kabob and -PRON- be unreal
the actual kabob come with such yummy stuff on -PRON- and then the rice and salad underneath be both amazing as well
good price for what -PRON- get and seem super healthy and quick
the food come out within minute
the costumer service be also great
super friendly and helpful with decision
bring one to san francisco please
there be two different location if u want souvenir and some beer or mixed drink
-PRON- recommend go to the stand by the strip way

-PRON- love -PRON- and thank -PRON- to -PRON- bartender that help -PRON- so much with find a drink to -PRON- like -PRON- name be vanessa thank -PRON- girl
-PRON- will be go back
service be great and the drink -PRON- whip -PRON- up
the stand have more of a chance to interact with -PRON- compare to the busy hectic can never find a seat restaurant
carpaccio be great
sea bass be a game changer
make reservation
this be far most the bad middle eastern food place -PRON- have every eat
nasty stay away
this place will not last in business
place be always empty
bring food for -PRON- worker 6 people and every single person be in the restroom all day long
-PRON- get chicken shawarma which be cover in curry
what the hell
why
over price for the nasty food
buy a groupon for this place and -PRON- experience this friday night be fantastic
start with delicious wine and two appetizer
-PRON- do the cheese plate and the seafood antipasto
the seafood be phenomenal and the eggplant parmesan that come with -PRON- blew us away
when i go back -PRON- be get a million more eggplant parmesan
-PRON- entree be the filet mignon with mash potato and gargonzola sauce
-PRON- keep the sauce on the side and -PRON- be a great idea because the steak be flavorful and delicious without -PRON-
-PRON- boyfriend get a veal dish and -PRON- love -PRON- too
-PRON- can not wait to go back
still try to give pittsburgh a try but continuously disappointed
yes -PRON- be from pgh
-PRON- need to send some of these restaurant manager to other major city to see how -PRON- be do
just get back from southern cali
every establishment there be exceptional -PRON- want ur business
and nice
overall another pig with lipstick
staff rude
food be ok
maybe the good u will see here in the burgh
bam
stay here for halloween weekend
-PRON- be mega cheap and have a pretty good casino
would not stay here if -PRON- want to be real close to all the fun but for someone on a budget -PRON- be perfect for -PRON-
single deck black jack here but deal the card face down boo
lol
friendly staff and clean room
would stay here again
-PRON- go to amanda for a facial last month
-PRON- be fine
-PRON- have a cute boutique so -PRON- buy a top for -PRON- daughter and some little astringent pad
amanda recommend to keep -PRON- chest exfoliate as well
this month -PRON- receive an email from one love announce -PRON- october special
-PRON- call and book a pca peel for -PRON- face plus an add on for a neck and chest peel
-PRON- have tell amanda in the past that -PRON- have be do pca peel for about 10 year and that -PRON- skin be very thick and resilient so -PRON- need a strong peel
when -PRON- come in for the peel amanda keep say that -PRON- be go to do a light one this first time so that she be comfortable with how -PRON- skin react
-PRON- keep say that -PRON- know -PRON- skin -PRON- have be do pca peel for 10 year and -PRON- need -PRON- skin to peel if -PRON- be to consider the peel a success
after the neck and chest add on -PRON- be a $ 170 peel that -PRON- discount to $ 125 in order to mirror the discount price -PRON- be offer for just the face
so after -PRON- go through about three round of -PRON- tell -PRON- to not be afraid and that -PRON- need to actually peel when -PRON- buy a peel -PRON- maintain -PRON- position that she need to be comfortable and that -PRON- be go to take -PRON- easy this time
so now -PRON- be 10 day after the peel and -PRON- have not peel
-PRON- be sorry but -PRON- am the customer
-PRON- be -PRON- requirement that -PRON- need to satisfy in order to keep -PRON- business not yours
in my eye -PRON- waste $ 125
-PRON- have a special event come up so now -PRON- have to pay another person to really peel -PRON- skin in time for the event
the reason people get peel be so that the top few layer of -PRON- skin peel off and as a result -PRON- wrinkle and fine line look less deep make sense right
-PRON- have find that a lot of place will tell -PRON- oh -PRON- do not really need to peel after a peel
-PRON- skin will get the same benefit
that be bullshit
to -PRON- result of a peel = peel
be not that why -PRON- be call a peel
-PRON- think -PRON- have good end -PRON- review right now because even -PRON- be get tired of type the word peel let alone read that word anymore
-PRON- be not familiar with the restaurant since so -PRON- just see a sign outside that say gorham dumplings
and -PRON- go in think -PRON- would be asian pot sticker type of dumpling
which be not what this place be
all -PRON- really need be a half order if -PRON- do not like spicy food just be warn
-PRON- can choose -PRON- topping
nice little find just off state street
one of the clean tanning salon 's that -PRON- have be to the bed be up to date -PRON- get dark within 2 week the staff member be great and very friendly and helpful the good tanning ever
great concept for a restaurant but very disappointing mr. keller
any time -PRON- use the main item in the name -PRON- better be good
both -PRON- husband
and -PRON- feel the food be dry and over cook
the buffalo have great flavor but -PRON- be ruin by pair -PRON- with a dry bun
the fry onion ring and mozzarella stick be all over cook
one thing -PRON- do get right about this restaurant be -PRON- aioli
-PRON- be probably the good -PRON- have have
-PRON- send -PRON- 2.5 now 3 year old to casy and start with 2 days\/week
-PRON- wife and -PRON- have be beyond happy with casy

fantastic place
great location
superb product seriously if -PRON- do not own neuma hair care product -PRON- need to stock up here
great service
great cut
$ 50 plus tip for a cut
which be what -PRON- expect to pay for someone who know what -PRON- be do
-PRON- will definitely come back
-PRON- be underwhelming at good
of the dozen or so store -PRON- wander into only the banana republic and sketchers seem to have a decent selection
the whole mall be an outdoor mall somewhat like tempe marketplace except the walkway be super wide and the shade structure be not well plan
this be only april and already -PRON- be a too hot concrete jungle and the sun be in -PRON- eye for most of the loop
-PRON- would not dare come here in the heat of summer
also -PRON- have never notice this problem at other outdoor mall like san tan village tempe marketplace but -PRON- get cigarette smoke in -PRON- face about every 20 foot
either this place attract smoker after only be open a week or there be not laws\/ordinance here since -PRON- be on reservation land
regardless -PRON- be really off put
-PRON- do not think -PRON- will be back unless -PRON- want to go to a specific store
-PRON- be not even sure that this be in fact a legitimate business entity
in fact -PRON- like to think this place be illegal a fly by night outfit in some abandon farmer field concoct by south scottsdale hipster to stick -PRON- to the man away down south just north of the freeway and across from a cemetery
a cash only policy and a bring -PRON- own food booze kinda vibe
the cashier take -PRON- money one eye on the till one hand on -PRON- pistol and both ear tune to the police scanner
when -PRON- grow up in calgary attend the local drive in require a pickup truck-
in fact as i recall -PRON- think -PRON- be turn away if -PRON- do not drive one -PRON- know -PRON- know not drive a pickup in calgary
surely -PRON- jest
-PRON- be happy to see that in scottsdale this law remain largely enforce
back up the truck to the screen lawn chair and blanket in the back and a cooler in betwixt
the moon overhead and the soundtrack over the truck radio occasionally drift off into spanish radio and merengue from south of the border- and scorpion hunting with black light between flicks- hard not to give -PRON- a five
great food and -PRON- have a great happy hour menu
whether -PRON- like traditional japanese food or sushi this place have very fresh good food and price
when -PRON- be in vegas -PRON- stay in the venetian 90 of the time
have the restaurant right near -PRON- elevator be a plus just a short walk and -PRON- will get some great food
-PRON- wife and -PRON- already enjoy the cheesecake factor
so with this be a sister company -PRON- be sure -PRON- would love -PRON- and -PRON- do
during -PRON- last visit a few month ago where -PRON- stay for 4 day -PRON- at there at least once a day
-PRON- order pizza steak italian burger and always have a very enjoyable meal
the staff have always be helpful and friendly and -PRON- will be go back again and again during each future visit
bad massage experience ever omg
-PRON- be a reflexology frequenter and this be the bad
first of all -PRON- come with a party of four -PRON- call ahead and make an appointment to make sure -PRON- could accommodate -PRON- all which -PRON- assure -PRON- -PRON- could
so -PRON- get there and -PRON- look like -PRON- have no clue why -PRON- be there -PRON- double check the call because -PRON- think maybe -PRON- call the wrong place and no
-PRON- take three of -PRON- in one room and leave one person in the party all alone
-PRON- be suppose to have an hour combo massage
-PRON- start -PRON- brother in law then maybe 5 7min later -PRON- sister then
maybe 10 15min later -PRON-
meanwhile the 4th member in -PRON- party be sit alone with foot soak for 25min
the lady do mine get up and leaf and then come back just say -PRON- boyfriend -PRON- boyfriend so -PRON- go to the room where -PRON- be get -PRON- massage and apparently -PRON- have leave -PRON- there for 25 minute soak
and -PRON- get up and leave because -PRON- be annoy of waiting
do not blame him)
why -PRON- make -PRON- get up from -PRON- massage to see this -PRON- be not sure
so then -PRON- go back
somehow -PRON- all finish -PRON- massage at the same time even though -PRON- all start incredibly stagger with 20 + minute between the first and third massage start
to end this craptastic experience -PRON- sister be pay -PRON- leave -PRON- 20 tip each the lady hand -PRON- back the $ 15 and say no ten dollar tip each
be -PRON- serious
after -PRON- be unprepared make -PRON- wait and short -PRON- massage time
the gall of people
never ever again
from the moment -PRON- walk in the door this place capture -PRON- with -PRON- atmosphere
fun eclectic modern
-PRON- just beckon -PRON- to stay and have a good time
-PRON- really think of all the detail
-PRON- be sit at a booth but -PRON- happen to notice that every couple chair at the bar -PRON- have usb port for -PRON- phone
genius
now that be how -PRON- keep people in -PRON- seat
aside from great food of course the food be really good
-PRON- start with the onion ring which -PRON- love the concept of however the ranch dressing seasoning be so thick and heavy that -PRON- be way over salty
-PRON- be to the point that -PRON- burn -PRON- taste bud almost and hurt from all the salt
-PRON-
really want to like -PRON- -PRON- just need the ranch tone down
both of -PRON- burger be phenomenal
perfectly cook great flavor
-PRON- share a side of the mac cheese which -PRON- could eat every day for the rest of -PRON- life quite happily
-PRON- really enjoy watch the bartender work -PRON- seem to really put a lot of effort into -PRON- drink and create really unique product
-PRON- do not try any -PRON- but -PRON- sure make -PRON- want to
overall -PRON- be a great experience -PRON- large complaint be just the price be really steep for burger and fry kind of food
-PRON- be delicious
but not worth the price tag
however -PRON- know -PRON- recently start a $ 10 meal deal which definitely have -PRON- interested to go back
come in on a sunday for brunch and the wait be about 30 minute
the place be pretty packed
-PRON- be assume that both local and tourist frequent here
-PRON- be a nice drive off the strip
$ 5 for a kiwi watermelon lemonade
pricey
but -PRON- be well worth -PRON-
-PRON- get a nice wedge of watermelon with -PRON-
perfect if -PRON- be a little parched from the previous crazy night
warning
the portion here be massive
-PRON- be funny because when -PRON- first get seat -PRON- walk by this huge table that be wait for -PRON- tab
two thing -PRON- notice be that everyone have a togo box in front of -PRON-
second everyone look like -PRON- be sit in that post food coma stage mode wait to knock the f out
-PRON- have the fry chicken and waffle of course
-PRON- barely put a dent in this plate
have to box up at least half of -PRON-
-PRON- do not know if -PRON- beat roscoe 's chicken and waffles but
the amount of food sure be over whelm
actually everyone on -PRON- table do not finish -PRON- food not even close
-PRON- feel like -PRON- be waste so much food and that some poor kid in mogadishu could have be feast on -PRON- leftover
unless -PRON- can chow down like no other -PRON- may want to share a plate with someone rather than all order something individually
btw the flapjack here be a size of an oldskool 99 acura integra gs r stock rim
-PRON- be a little pricey
but -PRON- do get a lot
-PRON- say try -PRON- out one time
so -PRON- can at least say -PRON- have din at this infamous spot
-PRON- do not seem like a diet friendly joint
ok so -PRON- get that the food and beer be tasty
and -PRON- love the idea of share plate
however the price of these small plate be a bit outrageous for what -PRON- actually get
between 5 of -PRON- -PRON- have to order 4 plate of wing 3 souvlaki plate 2 gnocchi eggplant 2 order of rapini mushroom salad 2 order of the salbitxada 2 pasta fagioli scallop plate and -PRON- think a couple more and a few of -PRON- be still hungry
-PRON- be also small people
-PRON- just think that spend over $ 40 a person on food would result in feel full
not to mention that the beer be severely over price
a bottle of craft beer for $ 16-$24 be beyond ridiculous
look up some of the beer on the lcbo website and see -PRON- go for $ 3.50 be dishearten
-PRON- order a couple glass of red wine which be actually really good but when -PRON- order -PRON- 2nd glass the waiter bring the bottle to the table and free pour -PRON- even though -PRON- have not finish drink -PRON- first glass
at first -PRON- think oh good if -PRON- be free pour on top of -PRON- unfinished wine -PRON- may pour a little extra
nope
-PRON- be pretty sure -PRON- be pour up to the amount that -PRON- first glass be at with the add extra wine that -PRON- have not finish so ultimately a pretty tiny pour
after be there for an hour and a half and have 3 glass of wine -PRON- be obviously quite thirsty and ask for a glass of water to which the waiter respond with water as if to say why be not -PRON- order more wine
-PRON- be not very impressed with that
dude -PRON- need water
do not try to make -PRON- feel stupid for be human
-PRON- do have to say that all the food taste very good
good job to the kitchen
but overall -PRON- think this place be overprice and leave -PRON- want more even after spend over $ 100 per person
the shepherd pie grill cheese with mac and cheese and the champ potato be very tasty
-PRON- son be still talk about the potato
a damned fine slice of ny pizza with a pretty decent list of topping
get delivery from here today-
-PRON- be prompt the pizza be tasty the price be right and -PRON- be good for what -PRON- be good for
ny pizza be not -PRON- favorite but that will not stop -PRON- from give this place a solid rating
-PRON- do what -PRON- do and -PRON- be do -PRON- well
-PRON- give -PRON- prop for that
great coffee spot in the eglinton\/davisville area
the staff be always super nice and -PRON- make great latte
the interior be very relaxing and there be also quite a bit of natural light if -PRON- sit near the front
-PRON- use jason 's deli cater for a family event 30 people and -PRON- be fantastic
could not be easy
place -PRON- order online the option and price be clearly describe along with -PRON- location and delivery date\/time and -PRON- be do
-PRON- call to confirm the day before and the delivery be make on time and with everything -PRON- need
such a relief when -PRON- be plan an event
scottsdale az
a mother of three and an 18 month old baby girl be kill and several other hurt in a multicar pile up on loop 101 at cactus
witness at the scene say -PRON- see the infiniti suv rear wheel radically bounce abruptly then swerve out of control then careen off two other vehicle before roll several time kill both mother and baby instantly
investigation have conclude the rear wheel be not instal properly by a scottsdale infiniti dealership and the lug nut come loose cause the vehicle to lose control
the infiniti dealership will stand to lose $ 100 m in a lawsuit and a major hit to -PRON- reputation cost potentially million more because the mechanic work on the mother 's suv do a standard tire rotation forget to tighten the lug nut on one of -PRON- wheel
-PRON- leave behind a loving husband and two young boy
this do not happen
this be not a true story
but -PRON- could have be have -PRON- wife not be able to make a correction and regain control of -PRON- infiniti qx80 purchase from infiniti of scottsdale
read on
on monday august 18th -PRON- wife catherine take -PRON- infiniti qx80 into infiniti of scottsdale for routine oil change and tire rotation
-PRON- and -PRON- 18 month old daughter be give the vehicle and begin drive down frank lloyd wright and feel -PRON- be wobbly
-PRON- write -PRON- off to perhaps the condition of the road
-PRON- enter onto loop 101 and increased speed
the wobble get bad
-PRON- hit 60 mph and feel the car begin to shake and swerve abruptly to the left
-PRON- correct to the right and the large suv drift quickly to the right then leave then again right almost lose control and barely avoid the other vehicle on the freeway at 65 mph
-PRON- wife be amazingly able to regain control and slow down and move quickly to the shoulder of the highway and get the car out of the way of oncom traffic
visibly and physically shake from a near death experience -PRON- begin question why a nearly brand new vehicle that just have a simple oil change and tire rotation could act so chaotically and radically
-PRON- call -PRON- and tell -PRON- what have just happen and be very upset and scared
-PRON- immediately call infiniti of scottsdale and explain what have just happen
-PRON- order a tow truck to pick up the vehicle and return -PRON- to the dealership
-PRON- be able to be at -PRON- car in a matter of minute and pick -PRON- and -PRON- daughter up at the scene
thankful -PRON- be not in a horrific accident that could have take -PRON- away from -PRON- and all those who love -PRON-
-PRON- qx80 be return to infiniti of scottsdale and check out for what could have cause such a dangerous driving condition
the service advisor apologize and give -PRON- a loaner car while -PRON- figure out the problem
ironic
the loaner car have a warning on the dashboard about low tire pressure in the right front tire
within an hour -PRON- receive a call from the service advisor admit -PRON- negligence and mechanic technician of 20 + year oversight of not tighten the lug nut on the right rear tire after do the tire rotation
in fact one of the lug nut be miss and 3 of the remain lug nut be not tighten down cause the rear wheel to severally wobble cause the vehicle to nearly loose complete control
so because a well season technician who have do hundred or thousand of tire rotation forget to check and lock down one wheel
hey -PRON- get 3 of 4 do
what be the harm
well because of -PRON- probably one time ever in -PRON- 20 + year of experience of make a mistake could have cost the life of -PRON- wife and daughter
now -PRON- be two day since the mistake make by a careless technician
not one phone call to -PRON- wife apologize to -PRON- for what happen and nearly happen to -PRON- and -PRON- daughter
this be a miracle that something serious do not happen
-PRON- be all very relieved that the accident that probably should have happen didn't
that do not excuse infiniti of scottsdale from fault and further personal apology to -PRON- wife
-PRON- do not want money freebie or any other form of compensation no damage other than trust in -PRON- service and dealership
-PRON- would have fully expect be a phone call from the general manager ken schatzberg or at least from keri who give -PRON- such a nice apology do -PRON- mention -PRON- be not even in the vehicle
no call no email no flower but -PRON- do get -PRON- car clean next time -PRON- bring -PRON- car in for service
the technician do not deserve to be fire and -PRON- be not call for -PRON- head
everyone be lucky in this case
-PRON- keep -PRON- family together and the dealership be not pay a multi million dollar lawsuit
infiniti have an opportunity to learn from this experience without too much pain
some may feel -PRON- be be over dramatic but all of this would have be avoid have -PRON- just do -PRON- job correctly and safely and personally pick up the phone call -PRON- wife and say -PRON- be sorry
-PRON- come in tonight -PRON- be -PRON- first night actually come to this location
-PRON- do not know if the guy be the owner but -PRON- be incredibly rude
-PRON- have an attitude
-PRON- pay for 2 extra ranch with -PRON- order and do not get -PRON- when -PRON- go back to claim -PRON-
-PRON- basically say -PRON- be lie because -PRON- say -PRON- put -PRON- in the bag
well excuse -PRON-
but -PRON- do not lie
-PRON- only get 2 ranch and the one the driver give -PRON- complete the other ranch -PRON- have pay for

what a relief
jordan go above and beyond any service expectation -PRON- may have have

-PRON- make the both of -PRON- feel comfortable and the concern -PRON- have for meech 's well be be comforting
this be not -PRON- first rodeo and every time -PRON- have do this before pick -PRON- up be always a horrific experience
-PRON- would be bleed -PRON- pupil dialat and would have difficulty walk
when -PRON- pick -PRON- up today and -PRON- be lively and awake
-PRON- be so loving and happy
-PRON- be almost as if -PRON- feel safe and -PRON- know -PRON- be go to be good

-PRON- grow up eat bento since -PRON- be from hawaii
and -PRON- be thrill to find this store
the bento here be delish
-PRON- do have to come early to get -PRON- tho since -PRON- believe -PRON- do run out quickly
-PRON- once stop in during the mid afternoon and -PRON- be all sell out
now -PRON- usually stop by around 11 am
the store inventory be pretty low
but -PRON- do not really care since -PRON- just come here for -PRON- bento and aloha maid drink
four of -PRON- din here the other night
-PRON- like the atmosphere a lot
although the only section that be open outside be for smoker
while -PRON- do not go out there -PRON- have to wonder what would keep the wind from blow smoke from the smoking section to the non smoking section
three of -PRON- order the giant green chili hub burrito
the other person order the fish and chip
and none of -PRON- can say -PRON- have a good meal
the burrito be very doughy and chewy like chew fat along with a sauce that be rather water down
the breaded fish be a small portion overcook and the hub bread be hard
when the manager come by to check on -PRON- experience -PRON- explain to -PRON- -PRON- experience
-PRON- excuse -PRON- and come back a short while later with a 20 discount bill in hope that -PRON- would come back and try something else another time
-PRON- confess that the burrito be typically one of the least favorite item on the menu as other have have the same complaint
-PRON- thought on that be why be -PRON- still on the menu and in the specialties section on top of that
additionally how do all the other mexican restaurant make -PRON- a burrito shell a normal experience
even taco bell have a better burrito shell
btw the fish and chip be also in the specialty section
if -PRON- want a lot better burrito with a fabulous sauce try the special chimi at one of the moreno 's location
on a more positive note -PRON- waitress offer very good service and great beer selection
-PRON- be sit here wait for result on -PRON- beloved animal and everyone here in the office have come out and tell -PRON- where -PRON- be every step of the way

the vet and the tech be all very knowledgeable and caring
above all -PRON- be price competitively not a single suggestion feel like -PRON- be price gouging
if -PRON- be sit at home wondering if -PRON- should go do -PRON- -PRON- be worth -PRON-
the restaurant have dynamic decor with lot of different seating area include a large cover patio with a bar
-PRON- be seat next to the most interesting wall of log end
-PRON- be there on a friday evening and enjoy the live piano music which seem to cover every era and style of music

-PRON- meal be great
patty melt be smoke hot fresh awesome

the bad tow company -PRON- have ever face
lady at the counter course at customer without any reason
-PRON- be not like -PRON- car get tow away every day so please be kind to explain people what -PRON- need to get -PRON- car back
the rate be way to high -PRON- can easily find somebody else to do the same job three time cheap
and besides -PRON- be really slow tool -PRON- 2 hour just to push -PRON- car outside -PRON- lot
derrick be -PRON- bartender late night happy hour
and -PRON- be very generous and equally attentive with everyone in the capsule
please remember to tip ur bartender ppl
-PRON- be so excited to go out for hibachi
-PRON- think of these great flavor and a little bit of a show put on
good way to describe this be mediocre food and service
disappointed
-PRON- do not like -PRON-
-PRON- try the coconut base with coconut and cookie
whatev this process with liquid nitrogen or the base -PRON- dd not find the ice cream refreshing at all
-PRON- be very pasty and do not cool -PRON- off
maybe -PRON- need to try something else but be disappointed in the ice cream
-PRON- put -PRON- name in at 648 and be tell the wait would be 25 minute -PRON- get sit at 750 no waiter for almost ten minute and then be tell that food would be at least 30 40 minute and that -PRON- be out of chicken pasta and tilapia
-PRON- understand thing happen but someone could have tell -PRON- prior to -PRON- wait three time long than -PRON- quote wait time that there be no food
-PRON- decide to leave
when -PRON- speak with the manager -PRON- just laugh -PRON- off
amazing food small italian joint
owner still very involved
bread make here daily
huge portion
be hungry or bring a friend
get a cannoli to take home
-PRON- have dinner during busy friday night and the place be nearly empty
couple of people order takeout
the owner seem busy with catering order but still nice enough to explain all the food that be completely unknown to -PRON-
-PRON- order pork adobo eggplant and beef with potato
-PRON- all be delicious
-PRON- would definitely go again to try other menu
place be modest and clean but -PRON- restroom be flood so -PRON- could not use -PRON-
really dissapoint by this restaurant
-PRON- have now try -PRON- twice
the first time the food be very average but the service be acceptable
-PRON- go again today for breakfast
first -PRON- bring -PRON- the wrong order
then when -PRON- get the order the food be cold and really just not good
for $ 27 do -PRON- a favor and have breakfast at mon ami gabi across the street or at bouchon or any of the hundred good restaurant on the strip
aria should be ashamed to let this cafe operate this poorly
the food quality alone be unacceptable on the strip
the first time -PRON- be average
this time -PRON- eat one bite and shove -PRON- aside
the waiter do not seem concerned of course and still charge -PRON- full price for food -PRON- do not eat
-PRON- would be here a few time
-PRON- love where -PRON- be locate in the madison square
-PRON- love eat and people watch
the food be always great and the service be always topnotch
-PRON- have the sausage pizza and the homemade spaghetti
-PRON- be one of the good -PRON- have ever have
this place be not for stuck up restaurant snob or people who do not want to spend money
do not come here and order a pasta dish and complain about price
this place be a steak restaurant
get the steak and understand that -PRON- be pay a premium for quality food and service
-PRON- truly enjoy a great steak and carnevino prepare one of the great steak -PRON- have ever eat
-PRON- be out with -PRON- buddy celebrate -PRON- upcoming wedding
-PRON- start off with a great wine recommendation by the sommelier
the wine pair well with -PRON- starter and main dish
although some may find the wine to be expensive -PRON- be charge only $ 87 for a bottle of wine that retail for $ 60 in the store
either -PRON- get lucky or overall -PRON- price on wine be reasonable
the steak the strip be cook to perfection a nicely crisp outside and an incredible medium rare cook on -PRON- while -PRON- buddy get a medium cook on -PRON- fillet
-PRON- notice the rib steak at the table next to -PRON- and -PRON- look phenomenal
almost like a flinstones bone but tasty :d
the bread come with lardo
the taste of the lardo on the bread really make the meal pop
if -PRON- have not have lardo do -PRON- a favour and put the lardo on -PRON- bun here
lardo be a cure and render pork fat
-PRON- can not say enough about how -PRON- compliment the entire meal
some people may have find the music choice at the venue a bit odd
-PRON- listen to a series of 90 's grunge song
the music seem out of place at first but -PRON- really appreciate the atmosphere -PRON- command
this be an old school shop absolutely no bell and whistle but who need -PRON- when -PRON- have get such an delicious pizza to dig into
the crust be neither too thin nor too thick and have a nice bite to -PRON-
the sauce have a hint of sweetness that balance perfectly with the crust cheese and other topping
walk into the tiny shop -PRON- be hit with a sensory whammy-
the scent of yeast tomato and cheese bake into a pie the warmth of the oven the phone ring with take out order body crowd against one another as -PRON- await -PRON- turn to carry out the box that -PRON- be take home for dinner
-PRON- have never try any of rosa 's bakery item so can not speak to those but if what -PRON- be look for be just an authentic unpretentious pizza this be -PRON- place
when a place have over 500 review there really be not much to say
so -PRON- will keep -PRON- simple
parking suck especially when -PRON- be wear 6 inch stiletto and have to walk farther than -PRON- would think to get in
atmosphere be good but a little crowded some of the booth -PRON- be literally sit back to back with stranger and the table in the middle of the restaurant be pretty closely locate as well
service be great -PRON- server new all the detail about the dish and make recommendation as well
food be awesome
presentation be great flavor be delicious and everything be perfectly cook -PRON- would almost forget how a medium rare steak actually look when do right
moral of the story -PRON- will be come back
but -PRON- will wear flat and try to get a corner table
-PRON- have have the pleasure of eat great steak from nyc to kc to lajolla stack be as good as any of -PRON-
-PRON- have the small filet and frankly -PRON- may have be the most tender piece of meat -PRON- have have really outstanding
-PRON- also enjoy the 2 lb maine lobster think -PRON- may be to much for -PRON- relatively small appetite
but -PRON- be just incredible
i only shop
the sport store in town square for all of -PRON- sport fan gear memorabillia

love this place
go through a process of get 3 bid for a move to reno
aaction movers aka united van lines be the high come in $ 2900 more than the other two bid
-PRON- go with atlas until -PRON- tell -PRON- at the last minute that -PRON- have make a mistake and -PRON- would be an additional $ 1640 ouch
so -PRON- go to the next low bid allied

-PRON- finally go back to united and say that if -PRON- could meet -PRON- time schedule -PRON- would go with -PRON- even though -PRON- price be still high
could not believe when -PRON- get a call from united say -PRON- could not move -PRON- because -PRON- be not authorize to move within the state only las vegas
do any move company know what -PRON- be do
feel like -PRON- have be deal with some very shady use car salesman
-PRON- need to meet matt
-PRON- be an awesome guy and be the owner
this place be great and the beer be awesome
the food be really good
the staff be very knowledgeable and the atmosphere be perfect
-PRON- would like to share -PRON- experience out at the food truck feast on saturday 11\/5\/11
stood in line for a nominal amount of time most truck have lines)
see a lot of people stand around
so -PRON- think
this must be the bizneez
make -PRON- order and -PRON- give -PRON- a number 60
what number be -PRON- on
almost immediately -PRON- hear number 22 effffffffffffff
ok well maybe -PRON- be crank these out pretty fast
at this point the smell of tasty bunz disspiate and the food zombie that surround -PRON- come into focus
do i teleport to the dmv
in -PRON- 45 minute wait
yes -PRON- hear right
-PRON- encounter a person that stand in line order and receive -PRON- food from 2 other truck lucky bastard
a person that wait about 25 minute and decide to give -PRON- number away and donate -PRON- $ 6 to tasty bunz
a person that write an entire blog post while wait a person that go back to the register and demand -PRON- money back because -PRON- do not even slightly indicate the wait that -PRON- have ahead of -PRON-
several people that stick -PRON- out and wait for -PRON- food walk away say this be -PRON-
at least 20 + people that get out of line when -PRON- find out how long the wait be
minute 45 almost on the dot
"number 60 woot!
nevermind
-PRON- call -PRON- number before 59
but yes
-PRON- do not even look in the box
just run away sheild -PRON- food from the enraged mob
now for the reveal
y u so small
ok whatev the french do small portion right small delcious portion
the taste meh
-PRON- guess ur good
but how hard be -PRON- to make mac cheese not delicious
ok garlic fry
wow
that allotta garlic
fortunately -PRON- be not bear a vampire and love -PRON- some garlic
so a+ for that mess
how about the tempura fry oreo with caramel sauce
yes this be what be go to kill -PRON-
this exact thing
bottom line be
a)these people need to work on serve large crowd
there be no shame in limit -PRON- menu for large event
most place do this and -PRON- would be willing to bet -PRON- make more revenue
b
if -PRON- make people wait that long the shiz better be delicious and memorable
the most memorable thing -PRON- get from -PRON- -PRON- could pretty much make -PRON-
hello oreo tempura batter caramel get -PRON-
thank for the story tasty bunz but there be a lot of food truck in vegas now
the only place -PRON- may be follow -PRON- from now on be twitter
ooo sweet burn
at 2 p.m. the strong maple syrup smell be unappetiz
beer list be weak
food selection be unimpressive
server be dismissive
-PRON- may feel different about this place on a sunday morning which appear to be -PRON- string suit
amazing spot in charlotte
kendra and justin be very helpful for a first time guest
would definitely recommend

-PRON- be stuttgarter westen ist ein geheimtipp
entstanden aus einer typischen
arbeiterkneipe hat sich dies kleinod italienischer gastronomiekunst ganz schön gemausert
die inhaberfamilie bestehend
aus
papa und
mama und zwei kindern haben etwa gezaubert
nämlich frische gerichte zum erschwinglichen preis
auch zum mitnehmen
das macht sehr viel spaß
also ausprobieren
es lohnt sich
this place be great
a local salesman refer this as the must see place to go to enjoy the scenery and the food
-PRON- be not mistaken
the view be great especially as the sun start to set and the strip light can be see in off in the distance
the wait staff be all friendly and the service be wonderful
the food be also good there be so many thing to choose from and not enough room in -PRON- stomach to possibly try all of -PRON-
-PRON- would definately come back here to try out other thing on the menu
the good pakora ever
light not cakey like some -PRON- have try and never greasy
the best village pizza have a wonderful friendly staff who provide excellent service every time that -PRON- have be there and that have be alot of time
-PRON- remodel -PRON- restaurant a couple of year ago do a great job of create a warm and friendly atmosphere
and as -PRON- state before -PRON- staff be always friendly and accomodat
-PRON- have live in lagrange for year and village pizza be somewhere that the village should be very proud of
by the way -PRON- food pizza etc be awesome
very consistient always good
the best pizza around
this be the perfect breakfast and lunch spot
the food be good the price be good and -PRON- have a few over the top offering
most in -PRON- group order omelette with potato and toast
-PRON- order the sin o man pancake and -PRON- be delicious
for -PRON- a bit too sweet to finish but a generous portion that -PRON- share with everyone at the table
all other in -PRON- group rave over the potato and for coffee lover -PRON- friend love the cold brew
will definitely hit this spot each time -PRON- be in town
-PRON- greatly appreciate this church and all the support group class retreat and child care -PRON- have to offer not to mention the amazing festival -PRON- offer halloween etc
but the sunday service be a hard pill to swallow
the lesson -PRON- have find to be inspirational and good
but the music be too loud -PRON- be get too many light camera and -PRON- all seem too much of a show
why why why
why would -PRON- have sean from the bachleor come to the church as a honored guest to speak as if -PRON- be to be respect as an example in this world
why be -PRON- lower -PRON- standard so much
okay so -PRON- choose not to sleep with the girl while date -PRON- all
but do -PRON- not flirt play with the eye candy have impurity in -PRON- heart while lust with -PRON- eye and play tonsil hockey with -PRON-
come on ccf really
and to boot -PRON- can actually win a ticket to actually meet -PRON- as if -PRON- be a celebrity or jesus
so disappointing
-PRON- be really enjoy attend come to this church with -PRON- family but -PRON- will stop now due to the obvious lack of common sense
this place go downhill 100 since the bartender name mikey be not there on saturday night anymore

-PRON- will be back
come hear to celebrate -PRON- friend 's birthday last week
-PRON- order -PRON- classic tasting menu which to -PRON- estimation be not worth what -PRON- pay for
-PRON- be a six course meal
what stand out from the entree be the miso base sea bass this be expertly cook melt in -PRON- mouth creation
-PRON- all agree that this be one dish worth come back for
the lobster pot pie be also good
all the rest of the meal be simply forgettable
the service however be spot on
whenever -PRON- write a review -PRON- always ask -PRON- will -PRON- go back
with all the other well know restaurant in the area probably not
-PRON- think -PRON- would rather try the other before come back to this place
let -PRON- tell -PRON- about amazing service
drive over to pick up order
but -PRON- have not get -PRON- from yelp
so -PRON- show -PRON- the receipt

since -PRON- wife have purchase -PRON- nissian from -PRON- a year and a half ago
-PRON- have be an absolute joke deal with the service department
-PRON- have be lie to on more than one occasion
-PRON- will tell -PRON- anything on the phone to get -PRON- in
and when -PRON- there guess what
-PRON- get to constantly wait multiple hour to get an oil change
or -PRON- try to up sell -PRON- on a service and tell -PRON- -PRON- have plenty of tech on hand so -PRON- will not add much time
3.5 hour later -PRON- one of the last to leave even though -PRON- be the first car in
-PRON- do not get that service be an ongoing opportunity to build customer loyalty
well do not worry
this customer who buy a new car every couple year will not be buy from -PRON- again
-PRON- think -PRON- would still pick fireflys over this place
this be an upscale tapas restaurant
the ambiance and decor be appeal but -PRON- be super noisy
-PRON- feel like -PRON- have to yell at the person that -PRON- be talk to in front of -PRON- because -PRON- be so noisy
not exactly a place -PRON- would take a first date to if -PRON- want to get to know -PRON-
-PRON- go with a big group so the menu -PRON- have be preorder
-PRON- food be good overall
the only thing -PRON- do not like be the salmon egg
-PRON- be really fishy and a bit too salty
the paella be just okay
-PRON- desert chocolate mousse be awesome though
really bad customer service bad and expensive drink $ 14 martini with no olive because -PRON- run out of -PRON- last night
-PRON- be sit at the bar and -PRON- make -PRON- leave -PRON- seat because -PRON- be get crowd and -PRON- have to make room for people
why do -PRON- have bar stool in the first place
-PRON- could not even finish -PRON- drink because the guy say -PRON- have to stand up right now because -PRON- have to remove the stool seriously
why do -PRON- call -PRON- a cocktail bar if people be not even allow to sit down to have -PRON- drink
-PRON- have a party of 3 and -PRON- all very much enjoy the experience
-PRON- be there on a saturday evening without reservation
-PRON- wait in the bar for maybe 30 to 45 minute and the time go fast
-PRON- be seat in a booth and like -PRON- location
the food be excellent
-PRON- have rib and be very satisfied
the other two people give -PRON- item rave review
-PRON- talk and laugh and have a great time
-PRON- waiter be average but do not wreck anything
the ambiance be very nice
the food be very good
the experience be enjoyable and memorable
-PRON- would definitely return
friendly
fun
clean
simply perfect
a must try
but addict

this review be about bank of america policy and not any branch in particular
paypay send -PRON- a credit against one of -PRON- b of a card
that be do on 6\/25\/16
-PRON- see the credit sit in -PRON- paypal account and -PRON- show the card the credit be go to
-PRON- call the bank yesterday 6\/27 to see when the credit would post to -PRON- card
-PRON- be tell the credit would not post until the account close for the month
-PRON- ask when that would be
and -PRON- say 7\/4\/2016
this should be illegal because that be -PRON- money and the bank just want the interest on that card
-PRON- be sure quick to post the charge though be not -PRON-
crooks
this place be exactly what duke street be cry out for
good atmosphere with lively decoration
-PRON- do not conform to one theme but pinball arcade machine and getto blaster take -PRON- back to the 80 's
some may call -PRON- hipster
take a close look and -PRON- will find that -PRON- have maintain much of the original quirk of what be an interesting building
tastefully botch up floorboard give -PRON- a genuine feel and reclaim furniture work to good effect
the lioness lager be nice and -PRON- be happy to discover that -PRON- be reasonably price
this be what -PRON- have stick to each time -PRON- have be
the only criticism -PRON- can make be the price of the menu which put -PRON- off order anything
but on the flip side if -PRON- do cheap grub then maybe the place would become too popular
overall thumb up
another jewel in leith 's majestic crown
ich gehe gerne beim real einkaufen weil es sehr übersichtlich ist alle be man an lebensmitteln braucht
bekommt man hier und unter lebensmitteln verstehe ich auch bürobedarf fernseher computer autozubehör
drogerieartikel u.ä
es ist eben ein supermarkt der wirklich gepflegt ist und allen kunden gerecht wird
hervorzuheben sind auch internationale artikel ob aus china oder usa italien griechenland oder russland und polen
the restaurant be actually very nice and the service be amazing
-PRON- waiter be very attentive and friendly
the drink be also great
-PRON- have the crab cake as an appetizer and -PRON- do not disappoint
reason for just 3 star be the actual steak
-PRON- have very little flavor and very dry
-PRON- realize -PRON- ask for -PRON- to be medium well but -PRON- be well do and then some
-PRON- have the yukon potato as the side and those too be lack in flavor
for the price -PRON- be pay per plate -PRON- expect a lot more flavor
a vacation kitty favorite
5 star
this be a local casino and the tourist in the know
the restaurant be great
ask for the steak special
-PRON- be a delicious meal
-PRON- be ~$7.99 and come with 2 side and a craft beer or root beer
-PRON- often give -PRON- a $ 5 match play to use in the casino after dining
the casino be small but fun
-PRON- be not fancy
-PRON- be to the point and -PRON- like that
cocktail service be good serve -PRON- craft brew in large glass
-PRON- craft beer and root beer be the good in town
-PRON- can walk to this place from the strip
just go east on flamingo turn right where the rap star 2-pac be shoot on koval and -PRON- be eat good for cheap
come here on the weekend with -PRON- boyfriend to try the cheese wheel pasta
-PRON- have have -PRON- in nyc but first time try -PRON- in here in toronto
-PRON- believe this may be the only place that serve -PRON- in markham
meatball $ 12 come with 4 meatball
the waitress hype up the meatball
so -PRON- decide to give -PRON- a try
get to admit -PRON- taste pretty good
prosciutto parmigiano pasta
apparently this location make fresh pasta every day
although from the picture -PRON- look like there be not a lot of cheese sauce mix with the pasta the pasta be pretty cheesy and creamy
the prosciutto really bring out more flavor to the pasta which be good
-PRON- boyfriend order -PRON- daily special steak for -PRON- main
this be disappointing especially consider -PRON- be $ 40
not sure if -PRON- be because -PRON- come here after visit jacobs not too long ago but regardless the steak be nothing special and overpriced
the food be good decent italian restaurant uptown
excellent service
excellent food
truly a hidden gem
a little sketchy look from the outside but -PRON- will not be disappointed
first of all a big thank -PRON- to -PRON- waitress megan
-PRON- be awesome
fast friendly service and a great sense of humor
look no further if -PRON- want a great breakfast experience
breakfast entree can easily serve 2 3 people
there be a surcharge of 95 cent if -PRON- split an entree
-PRON- group order the follow entree
kitchen sink
corn beef hash
chile verde omelette stuffed french toast with apple compote meat lovers omelette
all be yummy
but -PRON- favorite be the kitchen sink and corn beef hash
true to -PRON- 's name the kitchen sink have a little of everything bacon sausage ham mushroom 2 maybe 3 kind of cheese bean bell pepper and more
sampling
all the entree put -PRON- into a food coma so -PRON- memory fail -PRON-
the corn beef hash be homemade
yum!!serv with fry potato and -PRON- choice of banana or pumpkin bread
think extra thick potato chip
crunchy on the outside some with soft center
-PRON- favorite be the banana bread
definitely will be back the next time -PRON- be in vegas
not soon enough for hubby p.s. check out the flatlanders special
reserve for the adventurous
square be an amazing salon
-PRON- have never be disappoint with the service every stylist and manicurist that -PRON- have use have be stellar
-PRON- be extremely clean and friendly which be why -PRON- keep come back week after week
-PRON- carry all of the good product everyone be very well inform and educate on everything that -PRON- sell and the professionalism can not be match
give -PRON- a try
-PRON- will not be sorry
lori at sweet life be absolutely amazing
-PRON- end up book -PRON- with less than a month until -PRON- wedding
-PRON- be so easy to work with and even with -PRON- be so close to -PRON- wedding -PRON- never once make -PRON- feel stressed about -PRON- and really make pick out a cake a good experience
-PRON- be easy to set up a time for a tasting and consultation
all the flavor -PRON- try -PRON- sooooo delicious
-PRON- make -PRON- hard to decide
-PRON- wedding cake turn out perfect and taste so good
after -PRON- consultation -PRON- fiancé
and -PRON- could not wait to be able to eat some of -PRON- wedding cake
-PRON- have so many compliment on the cake during the reception from all -PRON- family and friend
plus have a wonderful vendor like -PRON- really help -PRON- by have one less thing to worry about
thank you lori
have a great experience with alamo
-PRON- walk out of baggage claim right onto a bus to the rental car center
no wait at all
-PRON- be about a 10 minute ride to the center
once -PRON- get there -PRON- be able to use the alamo kiosk to get -PRON- paperwork and walk out to pick a car
there be a lot to choose from
when -PRON- finally agree on a car -PRON- drive right out
no wait at all
-PRON- have a new chevrolet impala and -PRON- put over 1000 mile on -PRON-
the car be clean and perfect for -PRON- trip
when -PRON- return -PRON- -PRON- be just as easy as pick up
-PRON- pull in get -PRON- paperwork and walk right on a bus back to the terminal
there be no hidden fee or any other problem
-PRON- will definitely use alamo again when -PRON- travel
base on what other customer order while -PRON- be there -PRON- seem that tay ho be specialize in pho ga ` chicken noodle soup and -PRON- be pretty darn good
the broth be flavorful and the chicken meat be pretty good almost taste like free range chicken
the good surprise for -PRON- be the goi ga ` chicken salad
unlike many place that mix -PRON- goi ga with too much sugar and cabbage tay ho mix -PRON- goi ga just like the way people in vietnam normally do
a little onion a little salt and peper little sugar a little lemon juice peanut and a decent amount of rau ram which have a lemon and coriander cilantro aroma
-PRON- goi ga be something -PRON- get to try if -PRON- visit this restaurant
highly recommend this place for pho ga and goi Georgia
on the side note this place do not have parking at all

-PRON- usually go to the more northern one

-PRON- be food as -PRON- be mean to be in a wonderfully comfortable industrial style atmoshere
benkovitz be like a seafood base deli\/grocery
on the one hand there be a cavernous display of fresh fish soup and seafood and mayo base salad like cole slaw or potato all to go plus lot of unusual jarred condiment think chutney wasabi mayo and lavender mustard package food etc
on the other hand -PRON- also function as a restaurant
people come for -PRON- original fish sandwich and -PRON- can not be beat
two big piece of batter and fry white fish in a soft white bun
eat arrangement be a very small number of table and chair along with stand up counter
squeeze bottle contain tartar sauce not positive but -PRON- taste homemade malt vinegar hot sauce and lemon
-PRON- fry be ok -PRON- usually go for the onion ring since -PRON- seem to be get increasingly difficult to find and -PRON- be good too
-PRON- have other seafood sandwich and also thing like crab cake and fry clam strip
but the fry fish be really the thing to get
as other reviewer have mention -PRON- can be absolute chaos at lunchtime and on the weekend

go bluejays!!!i wish -PRON- have more variety of beer though
oh also -PRON- be right next to cn tower the ripley aquarium
for the price the food quality be not bad at all
actually the food here be pretty decent
but -PRON- be always too crowded and an hour waint in line be a must so -PRON- would only come back once in a while
also there be too many kid run around all the time -PRON- do not even remember what -PRON- eat by the time -PRON- get out of here
so crazy always and crowd
but -PRON- do have some good steak fry chicken man and cheese and chilli

-PRON- have do a lot and be still work on fix -PRON- up
-PRON- like the central location size of the rv lot and that -PRON- be not a concrete jungle
there be actually plant and tree which be sometimes unusual in an rv resort
-PRON- do not look like there be a watering system in the park--
-PRON- hope -PRON- add one -PRON- would be even nice if -PRON- be green

and as far as puerto rican food be concern this be excellent
-PRON- have the canu and arroz con gandules and -PRON- be delectable
the canu be a sweet plantain stuff with flavorful ground beef and melted cheese
hard to find something like that
the reason -PRON- be only give this wonderful place only four star be because a -PRON- have to spend almost $ 15 before be satisfied the profile here show -PRON- as $ when -PRON- should clearly be $ $ and b there be no fountain beverage only water and bottled\/cann drink
-PRON- be worth -PRON- however and -PRON- will certainly be back

-PRON- be slightly less expensive for -PRON- boba tea than other spot but -PRON- charge -PRON- for thing like coconut milk and blend -PRON- tea into a slushy
all in all -PRON- have work through some of those issue with thing like stay open and attend to -PRON- customer in line that -PRON- have -PRON- first two or three visit to the shop
-PRON- have be 5 or 10 time since
today the staff be friendly the drink be quick and -PRON- be fast service than the nearby shop mostly because there usually be not a huge line

lil ms. longlegs order the bruschetta for -PRON- main meal -PRON- get to choose which one -PRON- want
-PRON- order the eggplant parmigiana with the homemade pasta
-PRON- think the bruschetta be adequate bread be not overly impressive but the eggplant be divine
sliced thin and very lightly bread with thin sliced mozzarella and the sauce be very good a little tame for -PRON- but still excellent
-PRON- both think that for the food and ambiance -PRON- pricing be a little on the high side
-PRON- will go back and try some of -PRON- other dish
this place be on food channel which -PRON- figure -PRON- would be an 11 on a scale of 1 to 10

-PRON- be curious how this place even have 3 star
-PRON- do not read the review before go here just happen to see -PRON- and want to try -PRON- out
-PRON- walk in and the smell be
oh
so wonderful
-PRON- think -PRON- be go to have something fabulous
as -PRON- be browse the menu -PRON- spot a cookie n cream bagel -PRON- have never see that flavor and think heck
yes let -PRON- try that
kevin order one of the sandwich which have egg ham and american cheese
-PRON- bagel have zero
-PRON- mean zero flavor
wait
-PRON- take that back -PRON- taste like flour
-PRON- would expect for this to be a sweet bagel with hint of chocolate cookie but -PRON- be not there
kevin 's bagel have very little flavor as well but what to -PRON- expect with microwave ingredient and american cheese as the choice of cheese
the girl behind the counter be patient nice and helpful but that do not get a business anywhere when the food be just plain out awful
-PRON- will never return and -PRON- should save -PRON- money to go somewhere else
heck wal mart 's bakery behind the store probably offer good bagel
-PRON- be new to stuttgart but this place be special
-PRON- know -PRON- do pizza well
and -PRON- keep the menu focused
-PRON- use unique and seasonal ingredient which be always a + + + service be on point friendly and -PRON- do not mind that -PRON- do not speak german
-PRON- will def go back any time -PRON- be work in stuttgart
-PRON- website say -PRON- physician go to chandler regional hospital and banner desert samaritan hospital and see -PRON- newborn in the hospital but -PRON- office staff just tell -PRON- -PRON- in fact do not go to banner desert and only work out of chandler regional
bummer
otherwise -PRON- seem very reassuring and kind to this soon to be momma
-PRON- website contain lot of helpful information and direction which this newbie parent appreciate a whole lot
good value for fresh food fast and cheap however poor customer service be why -PRON- will only give this restaurant 2 star
line staff be extremely rude and rush order
-PRON- eat at other location and know exactly what -PRON- want
and -PRON- still feel rush
also staff try to give -PRON- a dime size portion of meat on a taco order
when -PRON- ask for a more adequate serve -PRON- receive a serving of attitude instead
-PRON- be a enterprise plus member and have be rent from enterprise for 10 year
-PRON- have rent from this location twice and both time -PRON- computer be down make everyone wait about 30 minute
after that -PRON- decide to do the rental the old fashion way with paper
-PRON- take -PRON- card information and off i go on -PRON- way
the last time -PRON- rent from here -PRON- call 2 hour before -PRON- schedule time to make sure -PRON- have -PRON- car available

-PRON- have a deadline and have to skip a meeting to make -PRON- second appointment
-PRON- compensate -PRON- 5 wow $ 1.85 on a one way rental worth 280.00
the 5 be off the daily rate not the total rental
enterprise know that -PRON- be the only game in town and -PRON- show

-PRON- think -PRON- go without say that community colleges will not provide the most rigorous academic environment
that be not -PRON- aim
-PRON- be try to provide a flexible and inexpensive way for people to ease into high education without take the plunge as a full time student at a 4-year college
but that do not mean -PRON- be complete crap
a couple of -PRON- very intelligent friend come through here and be now bind for pharmacy school and phd program
-PRON- be sure that many of -PRON- classmate be not fare so well but the opportunity be there
-PRON- -PRON- almost have to take a class here
-PRON- sign up deal with the admission people even speak to a few professor
-PRON- be all very friendly helpful et cetera
-PRON- do not strike -PRON- as heavy academic but like -PRON- say that be not what -PRON- be shoot for
in the end -PRON- be able to escape the obligation with moderate shenaniganry and do not have to take the class
but -PRON- get the feeling that -PRON- would not have be the end of the world if -PRON- have take -PRON-
thank goodness pepperocini 's be back

love the manager shawn
-PRON- be the little thing that get -PRON-
-PRON- mean $ 3.25 for an ice tea that be entirely ridiculous
a cup of soup for $ 8
-PRON- be not that special
the price be too high for the quality of food
the patio be nice the food fair
the service definitely the highlight of the lunch
-PRON- would say -PRON- choose another location for $ 115 tip not include for four of -PRON- at lunch
-PRON- have always be a huge carl 's jr fan but recently the portion size have start to get small
anyone else notice this with the hamburgers here
just take 2 of -PRON- dog in for a groom
-PRON- cut up -PRON- palm dog on -PRON- leg and -PRON- golden on -PRON- body
-PRON- call to complain and never get a return call at all
-PRON- also over charge -PRON- by $ 35 be chase -PRON- say -PRON- golden be hard to cut with one person
meanwhile -PRON- have take the dog to other groomer who never have an issue
owner be very rude when -PRON- express -PRON- displeasure with this extra charge without be notify of this as a possible charge
the bad place ever
be warn
you take your dog
here they will get hurt
cool spot with awesome view of downtown\/uptown charlotte
drink be pricey but delicious
defiantly worth the view
-PRON- go on a friday evening and -PRON- be probably one of the quieter bar in charlotte
quick service lot of server walk about
the butler be -PRON- favorite cocktail
defiantly worth a visit
be out run errand and a strong urge to enjoy a g&t overwhelm -PRON-
and so -PRON- think -PRON- would pull into the half shell and have one
the family dining area include midway type ticket produce game that young one can play on while -PRON- parent hang out
the bar area be spacious and offer a view of a tv from every seat
-PRON- have not din not have a drink on the second floor but -PRON- have no doubt that -PRON- go off in addition to offer spectacular view of the valley
-PRON- be tell that half shell will be change -PRON- be name soon to the board house bar grill in an effort to drum up more business
-PRON- will also be delete and add item to -PRON- menu
-PRON- trust that -PRON- do not do away with the half shell nachos
throw some shrimp on -PRON- and -PRON- be awesome
the only thing that freak -PRON- out be the crane like apparatus game that allow -PRON- to attempt to catch a lobster in a tank
the lobster tell -PRON- that -PRON- do not like -PRON- either
think the pinchy episode from the simpsons
the staff be always friendly
this be also a san diego charger bar
-PRON- can not wait to catch a game here
the cut cafe in yorkville
-PRON- be three storey high and -PRON- sit on the third floor beside the window overlook charles street nice ambiance
waiters\/bartender be funny to talk to beware though -PRON- may try to convince -PRON- to grow a beard similar to the one that all three of -PRON- be sport because apparently that 'd make people take -PRON- more seriously
yup penne arrabiata
-PRON- be usually quite okay with medium spicy food but the italian sausage in this penne man
the sausage -PRON- be already spicy top with the spicy tomato sauce soak the penne -PRON- would need a lot of water
-PRON- selection of wine be decent and the ambiance be definitely there
however suggest to go in group of 2 4 and 6 max because each floor be not particularly spacious and -PRON- would not want to get divide up
-PRON- would go back again for -PRON- 24\/7 brunch
-PRON- stop in here after a dback game because -PRON- sweet tooth be need some satiating
-PRON- order the banana cream pie and -PRON- hubby get the turtle cheesecake
the whip cream on top of the banana cream pie have very little flavor
no creaminess so sweetness nothing
-PRON- really do not add to the pie at all
-PRON- do however love the banana goodness underneath
-PRON- be like a heap of banana pudding on a pie which be heaven
-PRON- have get the piece as to go order so when -PRON- take -PRON- respective slice out of the bag -PRON- hubby ask if -PRON- have eat any of -PRON-
of course not
-PRON- tell -PRON-
-PRON- look at -PRON- and -PRON- look like half the piece have be eat already
the girl who pack -PRON- do not even give -PRON- a full slice
-PRON- be also slop into the container and in two different piece not because of transport -PRON- be serve that way
-PRON- be not too happy about that
overall there some way that -PRON- experience could have definitely be improve
food be good
casual restaurant but atmosphere
all staff be look very busy
great beer selection
friendly atmosphere
bartenders there actually remember -PRON- name and be knowledgeable about the beer selection
bar seem too good for gilbert but glad to have -PRON-
-PRON- live in los angeles and -PRON- have to leave asap and -PRON- be able to fix -PRON- car quickly and with a smile
leave -PRON- extremely happy
-PRON- will never return
-PRON- be a repeat customer for year and love -PRON- here
-PRON- have since slowly watch -PRON- decline until -PRON- start to see -PRON- kick customer out over not buy drink
-PRON- come in with a friend recently and buy only a muffin
so -PRON- ask -PRON- to leave
the place be almost empty
-PRON- love the atmosphere here but -PRON- will not ever come back
-PRON- overlook the rude staff for awhile and the drink price rise continually but be kick out for buy a muffin instead of a coffee of the same price be the final deciding moment for -PRON-
yum -PRON- be always great to come here for some of the most authentic mexican food ever
-PRON- have live in az for a long time and every time -PRON- come here -PRON- consistently have really good food and service
whether come with a large group of people or small -PRON- be always enjoyable
definitely recommend -PRON- and will continue to frequently
the ambience be wonderful but unfortunately the food be not quite what -PRON- expect
-PRON- would have give -PRON- 2 star if -PRON- guest 's conversation have not make -PRON- a phenomenal evening
the wait staff be not the good but -PRON- be very knowledgeable of the menu
all in all -PRON- will have a good experience go to el jalapeño 's on west 117th
-PRON- highly recomend gc glass
-PRON- come out right away when -PRON- call -PRON- to install some glass on top of -PRON- new cabinet
the glass really make -PRON- cabinte pop and -PRON- be very reasonable

-PRON- be sad to say one of -PRON- old time favorite go down hill
nothing be fresh grape leaf must have be day or week old -PRON- lettuce be brown -PRON- hubs rice be full of butter and -PRON- service lack a hospitable feeling
after have so many new mediterranean place in town ~ -PRON- will keep look
-PRON- decide to eat at firerock for -PRON- 21st wedding anniversary celebration dinner as recommend by -PRON- sister

the ahi tuna appetizer be very good
-PRON- husband and -PRON- both order steak ribeye for -PRON- and the 8 oz top sirloin for -PRON- with baked potato on the side
the steak be not over the top great but -PRON- like -PRON- enough that -PRON- finish most of -PRON-
-PRON- eat up all -PRON- 8 oz lol
the ceasar salad include with -PRON- dinner as -PRON- choice from soup\/salad be on the dry side -PRON- need a little more dressing
the restaurant remind -PRON- of a fancy bj 's restaurant where the ambiance be casual with a big bar area with sport tv and a touch of formal dining throughout
overall -PRON- like firerock and plan to go back if not only for -PRON- bread
the phone number be out of order
no other information list for another number
wait for a reply from groupon customer service
very frustrating
just go to get -PRON- haircut by pam for the first time
-PRON- highly recommend -PRON-
after a terrible haircut -PRON- get from a barber shop -PRON- be able to cut and style combover exactly what -PRON- be look for
definitely find -PRON- new stylist
-PRON- come from a large chain brokerage that charge a hefty fee to be with -PRON- company
-PRON- worry about switch brokerage figure -PRON- may not get the same education and support if -PRON- pay less
-PRON- have be with -PRON- home group for about 2 month now and -PRON- business have never be good
mark answer -PRON- question around the clock and -PRON- provide top of the line education and class
the good part be all the extra money that -PRON- do not pay out get to stay in -PRON- pocket or go back into -PRON- business
best decision ever
last year -PRON- be at a complete loss for whom to call for help with -PRON- divorce
-PRON- start out use a paralegal but there be just too many legal detail for -PRON- to deal with and question to be answer
luckily -PRON- be refer to malkin associates
-PRON- attorney be kevin vale
kevin be knowledgeable patient and smart about the case
-PRON- answer all of -PRON- question and give -PRON- all of the option before move forward
even when -PRON- disagree -PRON- listen to -PRON- reasoning and move forward with -PRON- choice
the cost be an absolute bargain which -PRON- find out after talk to friend who pay 4x as much and be still not do with -PRON- divorce proceeding
thank to kevin -PRON- be do and not break

not as good as when -PRON- first open
-PRON- hear that -PRON- have financial issue so -PRON- lower the level of the service and food quality and less food choice
-PRON- wishhhhhhhhhhhhh i could have spend all day here
can -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- just make -PRON- flight to las vegas with literally 3 minute to spare
in the back of -PRON- mind -PRON- just keep think
please do not miss
the plane
b\/c
we have spa appointment as soon as we land
needless to say i be overjoyed when -PRON- get on the plane
upon arrival to caesars -PRON- check in do not even wait for the bellhop and go straight down to the spa
-PRON- could not believe how beautiful calm luxurious clean and big this spa be
the girl who greet -PRON- at the desk give -PRON- a quick tour of the facility and be so very accommodate
-PRON- think since -PRON- be like 20 30 minute early -PRON- would just sit in the wait lounge for -PRON- massage therapist
-PRON- get restless and check out the steam sauna and arctic room
the steam sauna be the average but really steamy
the arctic room be like tiny snowflake fall onto -PRON- skin
the machine where the snow develop look a little messy since the foam be accumulate but other than the eye sore factor this room be magical
-PRON- slip out just in time because after i grab a bag of pretzel and start sip on the fruit flavor water jen -PRON- massage therapist come to get -PRON-
-PRON- get the mystic journey
-PRON- believe -PRON- be a 90 minute body wrap a facial and a scalp massage
at first -PRON- think -PRON- want to be the quiet person and just lay there and not say a word but jen be such a sweetheart and -PRON- really enjoy speak with -PRON-
-PRON- recommend a few thing to do in vegas and give -PRON- insight on the thing -PRON- do have line up already
overall -PRON- be such a great experience
so before -PRON- wrap -PRON- -PRON- give -PRON- a body massage and use this bamboo stick
that be so different and the pressure be just right
the body wrap make -PRON- feel like -PRON- be tuck into -PRON- favorite bed with -PRON- favorite blankie and the facial be just amazing
so so relax and when -PRON- start to massage -PRON- scalp -PRON- be over for -PRON-
-PRON- leave the room feeling like -PRON- be float on air
after the massage -PRON- take advantage of the roman bath
-PRON- know -PRON- be in a rush b\/c
-PRON- have dinner reservation
but -PRON- could not resist
the girl at the front desk give -PRON- a disposable bikini
but i end up take the top off since -PRON- be a clothe optional facility
the 3 different temperature of the bath be totally invigorate and then -PRON- jump in the shower
now -PRON- work in plumbing and heating
so -PRON- always take note of the shower when -PRON- visit any type of spa or restaurant
-PRON- have kohler which be the most popular brand -PRON- sell in -PRON- own store
the shower have 3 body spray and a rain shower with a thermostatic trim
which mean -PRON- set the temperature and then -PRON- use the diverter to direct where the water come out needless to say -PRON- be pretty impressed -PRON- have this system in all 10 12 shower
the area where -PRON- get ready be fully stock with toothbrush toothpaste soap towel sterile hair brush blow dryer and flat iron
-PRON- have get to say
-PRON- will always visit the spa when -PRON- come to vegas even if -PRON- do not opt for a service
$ 300 for the mystic journey be worth every penny
but -PRON- be not rich here
for -PRON- first time at a vape store the guy behind the counter be extremely helpful and nice
very honest and straightforward about the product and quick as well
-PRON- would definitely recommend -PRON-
size of the shop be irrelevant there be ample parking outside the shop which be convenient
11\/30\/10 2.5 star
came for happy hour but do not find anything on the happy hour food menu -PRON- want to try
so -PRON- order a medium emilia romagna pizza mozzarella parmesan and 12-year balsamic vinegar- aceto balsamico
can not recall what the price be on this pizza but -PRON- be probably around the $ 14 range
the pizza come a bit too char on the bottom and the very thin crust do not stay crispy for very long perhaps just 5 minute and definitely soggy by the 10-minute mark
while -PRON- enjoy the slice -PRON- have at the restaurant the leftover prove to be too salty when -PRON- try to re heat the pizza at home so -PRON- have to toss the rest-
not economical for the price
-PRON- be sorry to say
-PRON- only eat a slice at fred 's bec
-PRON- want to try the cobbler of the day which be the apple cobbler top w\/ haagen daaz ice cream if -PRON- recall correctly
have to order -PRON- san powdered sugar corn allergy and -PRON- find -PRON- good and not too sweet
-PRON- would try -PRON- other cobbler too if -PRON- do not come at a high cost $ 9 plus the ice cream have corn syrup in it- corn allergy
-PRON- would also like to try the profiterole but -PRON- too come w\/ a $ 9 tag which mean $ 4.50 per profiterol-
-PRON- believe -PRON- would ask how many come in a dish and be quote two
do not be fool by the scowl that the bouncer type bartender constantly have on -PRON- face--
-PRON- actually be nice to talk to at least the first time -PRON- speak to -PRON-
a couple of friend
and -PRON- go there after a mixer about a month ago and -PRON- be unapproachable and project -PRON- to be too busy to do more than to come over and take -PRON- order
no hello and how be yous that night- such a big turn off and w\/ a high price menu
-PRON- do not think -PRON- will come by again
-PRON- originally be go to rate 3 star but type -PRON- up as 2.5 but now that -PRON- have finish w\/ -PRON- review -PRON- be go to go w\/ 2 star
-PRON- wish -PRON- good experience here -PRON-
-PRON- boyfriend and -PRON- decide to grab dessert after dinner one saturday night
-PRON- ask -PRON- if -PRON- be up for try the new craze black ice cream
-PRON- agree even though -PRON- be not a fan of sweet but be more so curious about the taste of -PRON-
-PRON- arrive there around 10 p.m. and of course the line up stretch out close to the traffic light
but -PRON- be still determined to line up and wait for -PRON- treat
while wait in line -PRON- be offer water bottle by the kind worker at ihalo krunch
after an hour wait and get bite alive by mosquito -PRON- make -PRON- inside
-PRON- both order the ube nut which be a mix of ube and charcoal
while watch the guy prepare -PRON- ice cream -PRON- start off by put what -PRON- believe be a bit of thick cream inside the bottom tip of the cone to prevent the ice cream from drip through clever idea
then come the ice cream -PRON- twirl -PRON- around and around and hand -PRON- the most perfect look ice cream cone ever
the charcoal ice cream taste like regular vanilla ice cream to -PRON- and the ube taste exactly like purple yam which -PRON- love
overall -PRON- enjoy -PRON- ice cream very much and would recommend -PRON- for everyone to try however -PRON- do find -PRON- a tad bit expensive at $ 6.50
also on a side note not be alarm but when -PRON- eat the charcoal ice cream -PRON- may also come out in the same colour when -PRON- go number 2
do anyone else experience this
the food be excellent tonight
-PRON- get the brisket big sandwich with regular bbq sauce and coleslaw on top
side be fry and mac n cheese
-PRON- husband love the fry and -PRON- daughter love the mac n cheese

-PRON- be delicious too
the white chocolate cake be the good cake -PRON- have ever have
-PRON- will use sugarlip for anything else and recommend -PRON- to anyone
-PRON- be beyond thrilled with -PRON- product and how beautiful -PRON- wedding cake be
first off good chip salsa in town
fresh hot chip thick salsa
a flavorful red roasted chile salsa a nice and spicy green tomatillo salsa
-PRON- have a habit of when -PRON- visit -PRON- father in mexico to visit every restaurant and try -PRON- version of the chile relleno the representation of -PRON- from rosita 's be a good as -PRON- can remember
-PRON- favorite mexican restaurant in town
authentic flavor great portion attentive staff
-PRON- do tend to get very busy at time
so be prepared
-PRON- be quickly become a regular here at this place
the coffee and chai be amazing beautiful inside decor comfy seating and clean
the owner be super nice people and always friendly conversation when -PRON- go in
glad to finally have a nice local coffee shop in town
-PRON- realtor have recommend arizona tile to -PRON- have redone -PRON- countertop with marble from -PRON- and when -PRON- come to -PRON- turn to redo -PRON- countertop -PRON- be not disappoint
one of the big selling point in -PRON- opinion be go out into -PRON- warehouse with a hard hat and just wander around in the row and row of slab marble quartz and granite
as -PRON- pick up -PRON- hat -PRON- get a little clipboard list the name of each slab and -PRON- location in the warehouse
the price however be nowhere to be find -PRON- be not on the list and
neither be -PRON- next to the slab
so -PRON- only find out when -PRON- come back into the office with a list of -PRON- favorite and -PRON- will manually look up each price for -PRON-
which -PRON- mean be great if -PRON- be work without a budget but for the rest of -PRON- -PRON- get tricky
if -PRON- be try to keep thing cheap -PRON- would recommend bypass the marble section altogether and head for the granite and specifically the one outside
if -PRON- be go for the kitchen of -PRON- dream by all mean marble be for -PRON-
-PRON- marble be absolutely gorgeous but when -PRON- hear that -PRON- be go for four time the price of granite -PRON- immediately cross -PRON- off -PRON- list
one thing -PRON- will make clear be that -PRON- only sell the slab and tile but -PRON- would have to find -PRON- own contractor to install -PRON- for -PRON-
this get a little weird when -PRON- contractor be quote a price high than what -PRON- be quote at -PRON- visit to the warehouse
-PRON- all work out in the end and -PRON- be nevertheless a really fun experience
-PRON- start off with the pride merlot
-PRON- be the good merlot -PRON- can ever drink
then -PRON- progress to the seafood platter which be to die for
these guy be terrific responsive responsible -PRON- be half the price of all the other bid
can not say enough good stuff
do -PRON- a favor call -PRON-
save -PRON- money headache by use -PRON-
a super disappointing dining experience
-PRON- husband and -PRON- be stay at planet hollywood to see the britney spears concert britney and make reservation for dinner at koi to eat before the show
-PRON- arrive at 6:30 and be seat right away
the girl at the hostess stand be super rude and lead -PRON- to -PRON- table in total silence
after -PRON- be seat -PRON- be greet by a super friendly waitress and -PRON- drink order be take
drink be bring out quickly and -PRON- order -PRON- food
-PRON- be not too hungry
so -PRON- just share the spicy tuna crispy rice glaze green bean edamame and the lobster roll
so here be a breakdown of the food spicy tuna crispy rice $ 16)- meh
nothing special and not very spicy
be not good or bad
lobster roll $ 20)- gross
-PRON- be a slimy cut roll with an insane amount of mayo on top
the only thing -PRON- could taste on this be mayonnaise
-PRON- be so bad that -PRON- husband and -PRON- each try a piece after remove the big glob of mayo on top and could not eat any more
probably one of the most unappetizing sushi experience -PRON- have ever have
edamame $ 6)-
-PRON- be fine
but really how can -PRON- screw this dish up
string beans $ 10)-
the string bean be okay but taste like something -PRON- could easily make at home
-PRON- bill end up be well over $ 100 include drink
-PRON- expect to pay this much but be bum out that the food be so disappointing
an extra star for -PRON- waitress who be very very friendly and fun to chat with
also the decor be nice
after the britney concert -PRON- randomly end up back here because apparently this place turn into a club late night
and -PRON- do not feel like leave -PRON- hotel to go somewhere else
-PRON- be okay
drink be overprice and the dance floor be tiny
-PRON- still have fun though
-PRON- be a big mall
anchored by belks very nice
-PRON- like the amc theater easy access from outside and inside the mall
how can -PRON- say no to this masterpiece old west burger
this be delicious
-PRON- highly recommend
-PRON- have be here a couple of time already and -PRON- have no complaint
the wait be never that long when -PRON- go- -PRON- wait for about 10 15 minute
-PRON- usually just get a regular manicure or pedicure which be $ 14 and $ 20 respectively
-PRON- recently have a french tip manicure do for just $ 19 and be pretty happy with how -PRON- turn out
the staff have be friendly to -PRON- the time -PRON- have be there
this be one dream -PRON- will want to wake up from
the customer service be mediocre at good
upon enter the establishment -PRON- be hand two sample cup and tell -PRON- can only use these once
while -PRON- applaud the adherence to health code standard -PRON- do not like to be greet with command
also if -PRON- can not reuse a sample cup which -PRON- be fine with how about -PRON- be a little less stingy and give -PRON- more sample cup when -PRON- ask for -PRON-
the flavor of the day seem fairly typical with a few exception although both the chocolate and vanilla be out of order
what
how can -PRON- have -PRON- two most popular flavor be out of order
-PRON- decide to try the chocolate chip cookie as -PRON- be a pretty unique flavor
disgusting
-PRON- try the peanut butter next and at first taste -PRON- seem pretty good
-PRON- get a small amount and add some topping
-PRON- will say this there be quite a large variety of topping
that be the one thing this place have go for -PRON-
-PRON- husband end up just get a bowl of topping because -PRON- find the yogurt to be so unappealing
at the checkout -PRON- be ask if -PRON- have a punch card
-PRON- reply no not yet but -PRON- be not even offer one
-PRON- guess -PRON- do not really want the repeat business
at .42 an oz -PRON- think this place be a bit of a rip off so -PRON- would not be come back anyway
-PRON- sit down to enjoy -PRON- treat and believe -PRON- -PRON- use that term very loosely
after about three bite the peanut butter start to taste like caramel and the small amount of brownie that -PRON- add to -PRON- bowl hit -PRON- stomach like a rock
-PRON- be a miracle this place do not give -PRON- diarrhea tldr
the yogurt be gross and the service be not great
go elsewhere for -PRON- yogurt fix
-PRON- have be a couple of time recently before show and have find that the key be to book about half an hour earlier than -PRON- would normally expect to and -PRON- do not have to rush
at the weekend there be always go to be lot of birthday party and family gathering -PRON- be just that type of place and if -PRON- be after an intimate meal then -PRON- be not the place to go to
the food be great though especially if -PRON- choose to be a little more adventurous than -PRON- would normally
the selection of seafood be good as be the meat main dish
service be a lay back affair but -PRON- have never have any problem
-PRON- be pretty standard food
-PRON- have friend who have work there
and so -PRON- be nice to be wait on by -PRON-
-PRON- enjoy the burger for the most part
-PRON- find the wait to be a bit long though
love -PRON-
-PRON- take -PRON- back to japan every time -PRON- come here
all those simple little shop with delicious sushi
the raman here be creative too
-PRON- come in the traditional great big bowl
-PRON- daughter and -PRON- usually share -PRON-
byob which be common here with asian place but if -PRON- get -PRON- food to go there be a distributor right next door with a nice front patio where -PRON- can enjoy -PRON- roll on a cool autumn evening
the barbeque menu be wonderful as well and always evolve
great place to dine if -PRON- be not in the mood for a sandwich with fry on -PRON-
paninis be what -PRON- be cheap alcohol and bread sami 's -PRON- ask to have the bread grill and the one dude be like sure -PRON- be not suppose to after 10 pm but -PRON- be not very busy but can do -PRON- this time
-PRON- be like cool
the another dude behind the counter come by and take the bread off and throw -PRON- in the trash
-PRON- and the person behind the counter be like what the fuc#. sandwich be not as good as remember however -PRON- do the trick
place be clean and somewhat quiet
the service be prompt
food do not disappoint
prices on the high side for the ambiance location and the food -PRON- which be tasty but not comparable to an equivalent sushi place on either coast of the us for the same price
-PRON- have be come here for about 15 year
-PRON- get fast great reliable service
rarely do -PRON- have to come back for the same issue
-PRON- uncle from pit of town who have have -PRON- own shop for 30 year say -PRON- would take -PRON- var here go if -PRON- have to
hear that from -PRON- uncle just reinforce how -PRON- feel about this place
-PRON- know -PRON- not just -PRON- car
will come here until -PRON- move or -PRON- close
honest guy
-PRON- husband and -PRON- go to las vegas every end of summer
for many year -PRON- stay at the golden nugget hotel casino in downtown las vegas but for the last two year -PRON- have stay on the strip try a new hotel each time
-PRON- annual trip to vegas unbelievably be not about the gambling but rather the entertainment dining and relaxation a key piece of -PRON- trip be about relax in the sun by the pool
-PRON- love lay by the pool from 10 am until 4:30 pm drinking reading swimming eat lunch sleep on and off and basically just be lazy
when home -PRON- be not the type of person ever to sit still but -PRON- yearly mecca to vegas be the one and only time of year where -PRON- do nothing absolutely n o t h i n g and love every minute of -PRON-
this year trip take -PRON- to the monte carlo
-PRON- book -PRON- trip through southwest airlines jackpot deals
-PRON- have to say -PRON- expect more from -PRON- stay at the monte carlo and be so disappointed that -PRON- call southwest airlines jackpot deal two day into -PRON- trip
-PRON- be stay for a total of 4 night and 5 day and ask if -PRON- could change hotel
after the southwest airlines rep speak with monte carlo reservations -PRON- be tell -PRON- could move to a different hotel and that -PRON- would receive a refund for the remaining time -PRON- would have stay at the monte carlo
the pool area be rather disappointing
the whole flow or feng shui of the pool layout be not welcome the position of almost all lounge chair face away from the pool except for the pool that be shade throughout the entire day
the wave tech pool be a complete disappointment
-PRON- be too short to really get any true wave go within the center of the pool
-PRON- have a volleyball area which -PRON- personally think be silly
why not make a giant wave tech pool forgo the volleyball area and put some lounge chair in the shallow area of the pool like at the golden nugget or mandalay bay
place a few table for gambling and a bar
the music be much too loud for the small pool area
as for -PRON- guest room the furniture be cheap thin wood have a feeling of be rickety the mattress be very uncomfortable and there be not any wi fi available in the room
-PRON- find this so astonishing
-PRON- be not as if wi fi service in hotel be not common or have not be available for quite a few year nor be -PRON- travel in europe where -PRON- would be surprised at any sort of frequency of wi fi accessibility
this be 2013 almost everyone have a smart phone and some sort of table
-PRON- be shocked
-PRON- think -PRON- be absurd to complain about check in and out line in vegas so yes -PRON- wait in line for a long time be this an anomaly in any sense no this be quite common at all property all over vegas except if -PRON- be stay off the strip
then -PRON- probably will not have to wait long at all
the feel of the hotel be okay
again -PRON- be not really luxurious or stunning in any way
the hotel staff -PRON- encounter be all fantastic courteous kind professional and friendly but the hotel -PRON- be not -PRON- cup of tea thus -PRON- go over to the mgm after find a descent rate on www.i4vegas.com for last minute reservation
flavor be the same as before very well do
counter service when -PRON- arrive
salsa bar have a green and red option both be very tasty
also include several freshly cut veggie
-PRON- order torta with mix meat(pork and beef combined and -PRON- be amazing
-PRON- wife have beef taco -PRON- come in a pair and have guacamole spread very good
-PRON- also order a shrimp taco come with chipotle sauce and cabbage a little too much sauce for -PRON- liking but very tasty
-PRON- also have a fish taco -PRON- be good
-PRON- also share the nachos with beef -PRON- be more fan of cheese sauce and these come with fresh cheese but -PRON- be load with beef pickle jalapeño olive guac refri bean and ton of flavor
definitely worth a visit glad to see someone bring -PRON- back guedo 's have be miss
take the dog in with no appt today and -PRON- get -PRON- in with no problem
the boyfriend ask -PRON- to write down a list of what -PRON- want for beauregard because -PRON- like -PRON- a certain way
and so -PRON- send -PRON- this
what -PRON- want -PRON- haircut to be 1.take the hair out of the ear
2.brush the the tail but do not trim
-PRON- like -PRON- long
3

bleach -PRON- butt
5.clip -PRON- nail
so -PRON- tell the attendant and -PRON- confirm -PRON- be aware -PRON- want
samys tell -PRON- -PRON- will take an 1 1\/2
so -PRON- return to pick up the pup pup with -PRON- mohawk chop off after -PRON- specifically say -PRON- understand the direction
samys say -PRON- would not charge and do -PRON- for free
just let everyone -PRON- experience here
continue to update this place be continue to identify issue and take care of -PRON-
while -PRON- have a way to go -PRON- be encouraging to see member of the staff on a daily basis work as oppose to what -PRON- move into where -PRON- be never see or hear from
keep up the good work guy
come to the consol energy center to watch a coldplay concert with a bunch of friend
have an amazing experience
the entry process be pretty smooth and flow
the audio system and light be great too
the seating area be just as good as the venue for some of the other few concert -PRON- have be too
slow inattentive service
average food
contrary to other review portion be not huge
mediocre restaurant highly overhyp
-PRON- have an amazing experience at jimmy joseph lux spa
-PRON- enjoy an hour long couple massage
the massage be incredible and -PRON- give -PRON- the royal treatment
-PRON- be celebrate an occasion and -PRON- really make -PRON- feel special
-PRON- go above and beyond and do way more than be expect
highly recommend
-PRON- somehow think that -PRON- unfit self would be able to endure 1 hour of non stop movement before -PRON- go
thankfully -PRON- be short on time and could only do 30 minute
do not know how -PRON- would have cop with 1 hour
sign waiver first before line up to pay for entry
there be locker and hanger available for jacket and bag
there be different area for different activity -PRON- be fantastic
there be even some sort of fitness class go on as well mental note to check that out later
these kid around -PRON- be have a jolly good time while -PRON- adult body be super tense
definitely a great activity
no matter how old -PRON- be
-PRON- will loosen -PRON- up and teach -PRON- how to play and laugh again
complete garbage
this have to be the bad waste of money -PRON- have ever spend
without the card -PRON- be 30 dollar for -PRON- and -PRON- wife and let put -PRON- this way -PRON- have good food when -PRON- be at bootcamp
and -PRON- eat anything
the selection be more sparse then the desert and what be there be either bland cook wrong have be sit under the lamp for way to long or all of the above
the macaroni and cheese be bad then a t.v. dinner
-PRON- could have make good taquito if -PRON- have microwave some -PRON- buy from the store
but yet the great part be some how -PRON- manage to ruin what seem like a pretty simple dessert bar -PRON- would have gladly take a rock cover with shredded paper over -PRON- suppose strawberry cheese cake which seem to be slather with red jello instead of an actual drizzle
besides the food the only other thing -PRON- have to even remotely complain about be that -PRON- be not very well ventilate so the smoke smell linger in from the casino which make -PRON- pregnant wife a little nauseous and that -PRON- could up date there decor
-PRON- be just a little old and have some wear
other then that the staff be definitely -PRON- good asset friendly conscious of -PRON- existence and removed plate before -PRON- could get back to the table
now all -PRON- have to do be work on get food that be edible
for all intensive purpose -PRON- would recommend go to the aliante just 5 minute away same price sooooo much good
why be this place list on yelp twice
oh well guess -PRON- will just cut and paste -PRON- review from the other one-
how do -PRON- not love the yardhouse
-PRON- menu be vast with many great choice on pizza sandwich salad appetizer burger and some other entree as well
-PRON- beer selection be huge- so many -PRON- will not know where to begin
luckily -PRON- sort -PRON- into different category for -PRON-
service be usually decent as well
-PRON- can sit on the patio and people watch or sit inside and watch the tv
-PRON- wish -PRON- have a good tv set up but nobody be perfect
this place be amazing
go here on a date with -PRON- spouse and -PRON- absolutely love the whole look and atmosphere of the place
the service be wonderful the drink be amazing and -PRON- have a fantastic bourbon selection and the food be wow absolutely top notch
will definitely be go back asap
and -PRON- recommend that anyone else consider try this place should get over there as soon as -PRON- can and give -PRON- a try
-PRON- will not be disappoint
-PRON- really can not rave enough about this place
-PRON- be so great to find a really top notch indian restaurant in charlotte
-PRON- have try a few of -PRON- curry and while all be great the malai kofta which -PRON- have never have before really stand out
-PRON- be in the most incredible curry sauce
while -PRON- be generally not a big fan of dosas -PRON- must admit that -PRON- be really quite good here
actually -PRON- have be here four time and -PRON- can not think of anything that isn''t good
the lunch menu be quite reasonable and -PRON- have a well stock buffet on the weekend

the area be pretty spacious with a cool bar area

good place to take kid
-PRON- son and -PRON- have breakfast here and the food be amazing
-PRON- order the arugula salad because -PRON- want a piece of pie and do not want too many calorie
-PRON- have never eat arugula before
so -PRON- want to try -PRON-
usually when -PRON- eat a salad -PRON- be nothing spectacular
this salad make -PRON- happy -PRON- be so good
-PRON- son have the banana pancake

wildflower bread company will see -PRON- again
-PRON- really want to like -PRON- golden buddha and not that -PRON- do not enjoy the food because -PRON- enjoy the hell out of the food but -PRON- have to give -PRON- two star for the service
-PRON- be really a shame because -PRON- have about three or four people wait on -PRON- since -PRON- be a fairly large party
and -PRON- all be really nice
but one guy mess -PRON- up for everyone
long story short -PRON- be gather the money for the bill but -PRON- do not want to leave the tip on the table until -PRON- be get ready to leave however this guy be really insistent that -PRON- give -PRON- the tip now
slighty put off but still be polite -PRON- want to make sure -PRON- leave an appropriate tip yet -PRON- stand there almost demand that -PRON- give -PRON- the tip now
sigh
anyway if -PRON- be not for the awful waiter at the end -PRON- probably would have give this place four star
-PRON- wish -PRON- have know about this sooner
the noodle scene in pittsburgh be pick up and -PRON- seem like there be a new place every month
some of -PRON- have be izakaya like place that serve japanese raman plus small tapa like eat and then there be also the thai noodle place in squirrel hill
this particular place be interesting because although -PRON- be chinese run -PRON- noodle and small bite be all over the place pad thai and street noodle raman pho singapore noodle lanzhou raman and more
give all that selection -PRON- be only able to try the singapore rice noodle and thai wide noodle this time and both be fantastic the former probably be one of the good of -PRON- kind in the city
while stir fry noodle be pretty easy to come by in many asian place -PRON- be often easy to screw -PRON- up
whether by be too soggy or too dry or with stale ingredient
both of these dish hit the sweet spot with just enough sauce and fresh ingredient and the noodle have absorb all the flavor that come with be cook in a wok over a large fire
the price be very reasonable as well most dish be around $ 10 12 while -PRON- have see some of the place mention above easily go to $ 15 or more for a noodle soup
the rest of the menu also have some more mainland chinese appetizer and tapa like xlb and beef roll pancake which -PRON- would be interested to try during a future visit again -PRON- have not see many of these elsewhere in pittsburgh
the ambiance fit well for be a southside joint and in addition to have a bar -PRON- also serve boba
-PRON- even see a sign advertise alcoholic boba not sure how that 'd be like but sure be creative
service be great as well
-PRON- come in 15 minute to closing time but -PRON- waitress be more than happy to accomodate -PRON- and give -PRON- recommendation
-PRON- almost never want to eat anywhere else again
eating in charlotte period make -PRON- realize how much -PRON- suck eat in philly funny how snobby -PRON- be about -PRON- food
sure thing be not make the same and there be a lot of stuff -PRON- have that other place do not
but -PRON- have come to realize what -PRON- have that other place do not have as much of be additive and gob and gob of unhealthy stomach decay
anyway this place be fantastic
-PRON- girlfriend and -PRON- each have a hero -PRON- have a chicken with broccoli rabe and -PRON- be both outstanding
the good note fresh tasting sandwich -PRON- have have in years
-PRON- also start with one of the good soup -PRON- have ever have in a small yet fast pace almost chain restaurant like this
-PRON- would have eat here base on the food alone for -PRON- entire vacation if -PRON- could have
-PRON- have never think this legitimately before this experience but the waitress be almost too friendly and make sure -PRON- be constantly take care of
for this service and all of this good food plus about 4 ice tea the bill be only 23.someth
-PRON- be floored
the atmosphere be fun clean and neat with a sport theme for sport head and yet still very family orient
-PRON- have a hard time recall a typical day dining experience -PRON- have ever enjoy quite as much
the only small complaint -PRON- could make be that the parking be confusing but that be a mistake on -PRON- part
go here if -PRON- be in the area
sad that that do not have a self serve checkout like fry and walmart do
check out would have be faster with a self checkout station
there be some terrible review about customer service here -PRON- experience be quite the opposite
everyone -PRON- interact with be friendly kind patient and competent
-PRON- bring -PRON- 6 year old 83 pound afghan hound to the clinic to get neutered and vaccinated
the cost for the neuter be $ 60
$ 60
-PRON- be be four day since the surgery and -PRON- boy be heal up nicely
why go somewhere else to pay upwards of $ 100 for a neuter
if -PRON- like thin crust pizza buck pizza be a good choice -PRON- tend to be on the salty side
ordering and pick up have always be very easy and many time multiple pizza coupon be available
-PRON- first choice for take out
this place be quite good
-PRON- have the vegan pull pork sandwich with the kale salad
both where excellent
lot of flavour in the sandwich and the bread be delicious
also- the dressing on the salad be vegan and sooo tasty
creamy and flavourful

-PRON- keep be tell -PRON- be go to be transfer to speak with a supervisor never get to speak with a supervisor only a 2nd -PRON- tech rep
-PRON- tell -PRON- completely different thing the guy the day prior
and then -PRON- be tell -PRON- could have the guy call -PRON- back because -PRON- do not see what -PRON- be tell -PRON-
-PRON- be so frustrated with this entire situation
every rep -PRON- speak to be nice and understanding but no one could resolve -PRON- issue without -PRON- spend more money
-PRON- be extreme disappointed with this and be go to try and contact -PRON- 1 more time to get this problem resolve before -PRON- leave cox and go to centrylink
-PRON- bf and -PRON- stumble upon this place thank to yelp
-PRON- be skeptical of the vegan part until -PRON- see the menu and talk with swanie
-PRON- love that -PRON- make pretty much everything from scratch
-PRON- really allow -PRON- to veganize most dish
point be many dish to choose from for everyone 's taste variety of what -PRON- would expect and some american chinese food for those who be use to that sort
lovely place -PRON- will visit time and time again
great service and compassion towards animal
shelley and bill make -PRON- shih tzu with serve separation anxiety feel calm enough for -PRON- not to bark and -PRON- haircut be super cute
wing be good overall not amazing but good but the cashier put in the wrong order for one of -PRON- and get an attitude when -PRON- bring -PRON- to -PRON- attention
-PRON- sigh all loud say okaayyyyyy turn around and leave after argue with -PRON- about what -PRON- order
a few minute later -PRON- bring the right order but -PRON- be leary of eat -PRON-
-PRON- husband love the fry -PRON- think -PRON- have too much seasoning
-PRON- be locate inside a bar and -PRON- be very smoky
-PRON- ask for two water with -PRON- order and -PRON- never bring -PRON-
overall experience be okay
-PRON- go to the bar to get water and the bartender be very nice
-PRON- will not be go back due to horrible customer service from wing king
this place cater a couple of party for -PRON- company and do an outstanding job
the food be decent and the staff be on time and prompt
-PRON- show up prepared and make everything super easy
the queso have to be -PRON- favorite
-PRON- still have yet to check out the restaurant in person but -PRON- be on -PRON- to do list
thank -PRON- tacos beer
-PRON- have have a number of great experience here
but -PRON- do think -PRON- be because the manager on duty be on -PRON- a game
-PRON- be fast and courteous and seem to really appreciate -PRON- business
-PRON- love the classic smoke turkey sandwich and a small be only about 300 calorie
the other employee be all busy do something even though -PRON- be slow which tell -PRON- -PRON- really care about this business
will return often
great food
excellent service
fun atmosphere
loved watch the manager walk around with live lobster so people can take picture
will be back for sure
update go back for a 2nd time
same great food and excellent service
-PRON- have family drive in from out of town to try -PRON-
-PRON- hooked now too
great job by the staff
that be a sign of great leader
high mark for beautiful decour food be consistent
there spin om poutain while not totally traditional be very good
-PRON- would however recommend
-PRON- definitely have there own regular the staff seem to fawn over while -PRON- glass remain empty
2nd time here
and -PRON- do so feel so comfortable
maybe just maybe the staff in the daytime be a little bit different
be there any great joy than try a city 's food specialty the thing that local can not stop talk about
whether or not -PRON- actually love the item be kind of beside the point
when -PRON- hear about the primanti 's sandwich and how passionately people feel about this long stand institution -PRON- know -PRON- have to give -PRON- a shot
-PRON- be talk about a sandwich that come on slice of white bread -PRON- choice of meat along with cole slaw and fry in the sandwich
why be -PRON- that a local speciality be never a light good for -PRON- veggie heavy dish
-PRON- can go with a burger as the meat and then -PRON- be a pittsburger
-PRON- go with the roast beef -PRON- and could not help but get a side of chili as well which end up be huge
-PRON- be a giant messy sandwich eat experience
and -PRON- just have to go for -PRON- and get -PRON- hand dirty
with no sauce on -PRON-
-PRON- would say -PRON- need a bit more flavor but -PRON- seem like the expert have -PRON- own ketchup and\/or hot sauce solution that greatly improve -PRON-
-PRON- be especially impressed by the cole slaw which be crunchy and have a great flavor which be probably due to a ton of sugar in -PRON-
but -PRON- can not be sure
-PRON- definitely would not suggest get this to go as -PRON- would imagine that the bread and fry would get soggy immediately
anyway -PRON- be more fun to eat -PRON- in this old location which do not look like -PRON- be ever be remodel which -PRON- love serve all messy just on a piece of paper by a hilarious and friendly server
cash only which be not -PRON- favorite but also open 24 hour which be just brilliant because though -PRON- give the sandwich a b+ at a normal hour as a late night snack after a night out -PRON- think -PRON- would give -PRON- an a++++
a perfect example of an indulgent local treat that -PRON- have get to try at least once
the place be show on google map as ntb but actually -PRON- be tire kingdom
-PRON- be one company but ntb have large facility
so in short -PRON- be mislead and -PRON- precious tall vehicle can not fit here
-PRON- be and old facility
-PRON- would not trust -PRON- leave nice import here
lot of fun for people of all age
the food be good and the price be pretty decent
will visit here every time -PRON- family be in town
as a fan of this franchise -PRON- be highly dissapoint in tonight experience
please hire experienced waitstaff and bartender
really quite sad to not know the simple thing like what a chill shot be
especially when purchase premium price liquor
manager question if -PRON- pay -PRON- tab after complain mildly
pure moronic experience
just absurd have this incredibly rude manager chase -PRON- down to ask if i pay -PRON- tab
will be let all -PRON- norterra folk know to avoid this location
drug dealer live here and no one care beside the that
-PRON- have see few pitbull and amstaff here
and -PRON- know -PRON- not legal to have accord to the hoa
but managment here probably do not care
there be special every day
monday be 1\/2 price wing
-PRON- be in brampton for business purpose and want to find someplace to watch a tennis final on monday night
-PRON- come to tee jay 's around 6:30 and take a seat at the bar where a couple other gentleman be camp
this be a nice place to watch sporting event
the service be exceptionally friendly and the menu offer lot of different type of meal option
-PRON- have a burger -PRON- be good
the side salad be also nice
if -PRON- be in the mood for a sport bar this be a good choice
there be a nice outdoor eat area for fine weather dining
this be incredibly the good yogurt -PRON- have taste
the entire place be very family friendly and the employee be indeed accomodat
-PRON- have yet to go to a place that have both ny cheesecake and cookies n creme swirl together
combine -PRON- be consider the pinnacle of dessert endulging
the owner know how to put together something so big so convenient
-PRON- can not go a week without -PRON-
incredible
-PRON- purchase experience be pretty good
-PRON- install experience top notch
service poor at best
-PRON- have call several times try to cool this spa off and the advice be lack at good
-PRON- think -PRON- have a lemon spa
-PRON- could not keep the temp at
a steady 100 degree
no one
at spa world could tell -PRON- how to fix even though -PRON- buy -PRON- from -PRON- 1 month ago
-PRON- even turn -PRON- down to 93 try to keep at 100 and that fail if -PRON- do not use -PRON- for a few day
-PRON- neighbor come over who have a similar spa and say leave the waterfall feature on 24 7
and now -PRON- be 100 all the time
c 's birthday dessert
after -PRON- have eat dinner at another location c want to come here for -PRON- birthday dessert
-PRON- be sit immediately and -PRON- server be victoria t.
-PRON- be great
attentive on point pleasant and not intrusive
kudos
so the birthday boy c get the lemon raspberry cream cheesecake $ 7.95
-PRON- love -PRON-
personally -PRON- do not think -PRON- have enough cream cheese flavor and be too sweet but that be just -PRON-
-PRON- write happy birthday in chocolate on -PRON- plate so -PRON- feel special
k have the lemon meringue cheese cake $ 7.95
-PRON- love -PRON-
-PRON- do not taste -PRON-
but -PRON- say -PRON- have very nice lemony flavor and have really good texture
grandma c have the tiramisu cheese cake $ 7.95
-PRON- only comment be yum
-PRON- have carrot cake $ 7.95
ok enough of the laughing
-PRON- be not the big fan of commercial cheesecake because -PRON- never have enough cream cheese in -PRON-
and since there be go to be 3 cheesecake on the table why add a fourth
plus -PRON- love good carrot cake
for the most part the cheesecake factory do a good job with all -PRON- dessert
so -PRON- never feel like -PRON- be go to be a bad decision not to go with a cheesecake
-PRON- carrot cake be very good
a tad on the dry side
but that be probably because once the cake be slice one side of the next piece be go to begin to dry out
the cake still have good flavor be moist enough and there be noticeable piece of carrots within the cake
the frosting be also pretty good although for -PRON- -PRON- be a little too sweet and could use a little more cream cheese flavor
all in all very good though
great service reasonable pricing great dessert

-PRON- be super moist with the perfect cake to frost ratio
pretty much the good cupcake -PRON- ever have
-PRON- cheap and the quality be good for what -PRON- pay
weirdly enough -PRON- sweet and sour soup be dense and high quality
-PRON- have be come to this place since -PRON- can remember -PRON- brother bring -PRON- here for the first time and the food be really good but last time -PRON- -PRON- sister and -PRON- boyfriend come have a weird experience -PRON- get there at 8:25 and -PRON- be not very busy -PRON- order for 3 and to eat in(they close at 9
-PRON- bring -PRON- food in not a very friendly manner and -PRON- start eat
a group of people come in at 8:45 ish and -PRON- see the face of the staff be mad at -PRON- for come like -PRON- really do not want any of -PRON- business
the manager -PRON- guess turn off some light and put the closing sign(it be 8:45 and -PRON- close at 9
so -PRON- guess -PRON- do not want anyone else to come in and do -PRON- in a really obvious way in -PRON- face
-PRON- be eat on the patio
-PRON- get -PRON-
-PRON- have work at food place and -PRON- be really hard
but -PRON- as costumer get there at 8:25 still on time
and the food be great and everything
but -PRON- be very uncomfortable for -PRON- to rush to eat -PRON- food
the 2 star be definitely for the food only because -PRON- get 5 on food but only 2 on service

-PRON- recommend this restaurant

every restaurant scene in any respectable city have to have a good selection of tapas joint among other thing of course
-PRON- be especially fond of the small plate joint as -PRON- tend to be a light eater yet -PRON- love try many item at once
japanese tapas have always be on the top of -PRON- restaurant list because well let -PRON- admit -PRON- the japanese just do food better than anyone
-PRON- stop in late night for a small snack before head home
of course as always -PRON- end up eat way more than -PRON- should have
while -PRON- thoroughly enjoy -PRON- udon the highlight of the evening be certainly the ramen burger
use pork belly instead of ground beef be a simple stroke of genius and the sauce be absolutely amazing
this just may be may favorite dish in all of vegas
service be great -PRON- think the owner be -PRON- server but the place be a little slow
which be too bad -PRON- think more people need to hear about this place -PRON- think -PRON- have a good chance of take the place of that old favorite down the street that recently fall off -PRON- perch
-PRON- definately recommend give izakaya go a go
establish in 2011 this independent coffee shop have be perk up the southern highlands coffee scene
two time this month -PRON- be a part of this scene
the two time that -PRON- visit -PRON- be study from the test prep guide that -PRON- borrow from enterprise library

there be outside seat
inside on the immitation wood floor be plush chair small table with seat stool at the counter and a six person table
the six person table be the ideal spot for a meet up and in -PRON- case get acquaint with the testing material
but if -PRON- be into read a book or chat with a friend -PRON- would prefer the plush chair at the corner near the library case
and if -PRON- do not want to leave -PRON- car -PRON- could use the drive thru
no matter where -PRON- sit the las vegas sun shin and complimentary wifi shin into perk up coffee
the change art work really shin into perk up coffee create a unique and interesting environment

-PRON- be so cheerful
-PRON- would look up from the six person table at wood and carving of raccoon mario and the power up mushroom
near the library case donkey kong be on display
over the plush chair an 8 bit rabbit draw attention to that corner
on another wall be 8 bit mega man
on the wall of the corridor lead to the rest room stand 8 bit glass joe from mike tysons punch out fame

if -PRON- be hungry
-PRON- may of order a pastry
on both visit the batista be friendly
last time -PRON- chat with -PRON- about the 8 bit wood and carving
-PRON- give a shout out to perk up coffee shop
in very recent time the las vegas metropolitan area lose three independent coffee shop galaxy coffee house of downtown henderson and beanz
-PRON- will not take perk up coffee for grant
-PRON- be perk up the word that this be a four star independent coffee shop that be clean unique and brew a variety of savory beverage
sometimes -PRON- crave thai food so much that -PRON- can keep eat the same thing for day
after try take out from thai taste -PRON- want to have a nice sit down dinner so -PRON- pick basil since -PRON- be very close to -PRON- hotel
a couple thing to note -PRON- do not make entree without fish sauce so if -PRON- be a strict vegetarian this may not be the right place for -PRON-
-PRON- food be also not very spicy-
-PRON- ask for -PRON- level of hot and -PRON- food be still not spicy so get thai hot if -PRON- like food that leave -PRON- a little sweaty
from the interior the restaurant be classy and intimate
-PRON- have the fresh spring roll -very average
pad kee maw- delicious but not spicy and a lychee martini yumm
-PRON- noodle be saucy than -PRON- would expect which turn out to be a good surprise
the service be great too

-PRON- review the course with -PRON- and -PRON- get some time on the simluator to get use to the layout of the track then -PRON- be off to the car
the lap go by very fast the track be about 1.2 mile around
-PRON- imagine this be so -PRON- can keep the facility safe when anyone can walk off the street and jump behind the wheel of a 700 horsepower all wheel drive supercar
-PRON- instructor greg be very helpful and encouraging
certainly an activity -PRON- would love to do again
next time -PRON- be the full blow race prepp ferrari

-PRON- even see a back room
-PRON- assume designate for private party
would recommend to anyone

this rating be for the bar section only
-PRON- come here to enjoy great cocktail but that be not the case when the bartender do not know what orgeat be so instead of order from -PRON- menu -PRON- order a stella which -PRON- be out
so -PRON- settle for a guinness which be serve completely at the wrong temperature and glass
the good thing about this place be the open air bar the great music and decor
if -PRON- can fix these small thing -PRON- would come back
here be a quick little link for the nice bartender girl who do not know what orgeat be
quick and simple recipe
http:\/\/smallhandfoods.com\/recipes\/
-PRON- should have read the honest review
do not take your machine to this place
-PRON- will rip -PRON- off and will never fix -PRON- machine
-PRON- take -PRON- hoover $ 200 vacuum out of warranty because -PRON- be act up
owner claim -PRON- need a new cord and a good tuneup to clean -PRON- out
the outcome over $ 100 down the toilet
the vacuum be bad than when -PRON- drop -PRON- off
new cheap and short cord which -PRON- do not need because that be not the right diagnosis
and the tuneup
all -PRON- do be put that sticker in the front
-PRON- guess -PRON- figure -PRON- will be a sucker
-PRON- open the cover when -PRON- get home
and nothing be do
the picture speak for -PRON-
-PRON- end up buy a new vacuum cleaner
love this location because -PRON- be close to where -PRON- live but also because -PRON- can get food item at a great price
the key here be to go regularly as the special always change some of the good deal i get here be
butter no name brand which can often be find at between 2.99 3.49 a pound and -PRON- always have salt and non salt great if -PRON- bake
cheddar cheese -PRON- have two brand that be on sale regulary from mild to extra fort for about half the regular cost ice cream various brand like breyers and magnum 's almost always half price
eggs for 2.19 bottled water -PRON- eska be always on sale 4 for 5 $ and -PRON- new fav a life brand flavor water 6 for 1.79 can beat that
juice tropicana often
2- 5 $ clean product like bio life which be green and many other that be all sale regulary
there be always sale item through out the store so go regularly up and down the isle be usefull and a great way to stock up on thing like toiletry
the pharmacie be also where -PRON- wil find really nice people with great advice
another tip be get the optimum card -PRON- will quickly add up especially on household item and -PRON- will be reward 10 $ off so why not -PRON- take 2 min to get one
and -PRON- be free
and -PRON- have free parking in the back but beware -PRON- close the back entry after 18h
-PRON- get -PRON- new rescue dog bo groom here a couple of week ago and -PRON- be a great experience
-PRON- live in the neighborhood but be very nervous about choose an untested groomer as -PRON- have have some bad experience in the past
-PRON- be happy to report that this be not the case at all
dee be awesome with -PRON- dog who be very mat and have never be groom before -PRON- have be live as a stray dog
-PRON- be so relaxed that -PRON- fall asleep in the bath
-PRON- come away look very handsome and smell great
a huge improvement from the stinky homeless dog -PRON- bring in to see -PRON-
also and most importantly -PRON- actually listen to the kind of cut -PRON- want and be willing to put in the extra work to avoid have to shave -PRON- down
the price be a tad high than a previous quote -PRON- would get from another groomer but -PRON- give -PRON- a 10 discount as new customer
all in all -PRON- feel -PRON- be totally worth every penny for how much good -PRON- new dog look and feel
-PRON- would highly recommend take -PRON- pup for a visit to dee
-PRON- would have give this place 3 star if -PRON- write -PRON- review a year ago
but -PRON- have really shape up
san francesco in north york be a food institution as far as -PRON- be concerned and this one fall short food wise and certainly in regard to -PRON- charm
but over the past few month -PRON- have just start to pump out good food more consistently
-PRON- would give the 4.5 star if -PRON- could
the food be great
-PRON- just do not have the charm of the alness location
-PRON- also may be a bit more expensive
if -PRON- want a saucy veal sandwich this place be top notch
-PRON- the only thing -PRON- ever order
so -PRON- can not comment on the rest of the menu
-PRON- get provolone and mushroom spicy
mama mia

kiss -PRON- finger
-PRON- partner and -PRON- arrive early saturday afternoon and -PRON- be pack
-PRON- order the cutepot noodle basically a build -PRON- own bowl
-PRON- choose the tom yum goong soup base with beef and sausage and raman noodle
-PRON- also share the fry chicken as a side
noodle
-PRON- be pretty
meh
-PRON- be not anything special and quite pricey at almost $ 10
the soup base just taste spicy without much flavour to -PRON-
the noodle be stale and do not have any texture to -PRON-
only good thing be that the portion be decently big
fried chicken
this be serve with mayonnaise and chicken sauce on the side
unfortunately the portion be small and -PRON- be quite dry
-PRON- give origination noodle a 2 out of 5
the soup base be poor and the ingredient do not seem fresh at all
maybe try some of the many other noodle house in the area and only come as a last resort
have not be there in a long time
the guy take the order be in some other world
the amount of pork or chicken on the sandwich have be reduce to almost half
the drink be water down
and the price be up
-PRON- think -PRON- will not be back there
-PRON- be very excited to come here as this location be not open the last time -PRON- be in vegas
as someone who be turn off by -PRON- last experience in -PRON- herald square ny location -PRON- be very pleased to find that the staff here at mandalay bay to be nice knowledgeable helpful without be overbearing and most of all -PRON- do not pressure -PRON- into purchase product
-PRON- actually leave -PRON- alone to shop in peace and wait a few minute before re approach -PRON- customer
imagine that
this location be also fairly large
-PRON- think aside from georgetown dc orlando airport and harvard square ma this may be one of the large lush store -PRON- have be in
-PRON- be open until midnight
so after see the lion king -PRON- go back and buy a bunch of bath product
many of the hotel room in this city have deep tub so -PRON- owe -PRON- to -PRON- to get to lush and splurge on a bath bomb or bubble bar to unwind after a night of dancing and drinking
or for the day after a brazened honey fresh mask do wonder for the skin
do not use if -PRON- have dry or sensitive skin ask -PRON- sa for advice before purchase
lush also have a very good return policy similar to sephora as -PRON- want -PRON- to love the product -PRON- purchase
product here may not be as vibrant or super scented as other store but this be due to the climate of vegas
the bath bomb -PRON- purchase be very nice compare to the one -PRON- get in ny
-PRON- also find -PRON- store to be clean and well maintain which be difficult as glitter will get everywhere in a lush store
-PRON- think -PRON- have rid -PRON- of lush since -PRON- price -PRON- out of -PRON- budget be a customer since 01 but this experience get -PRON- excited about try new stuff from -PRON-
do check -PRON- out if -PRON- happen to be in the area
food be very good
island rolls huge portion and very tasty uni sushi
super fresh tofu cheesecake not much tofu flavour but still a legit cheesecake service
friendly but -PRON- take a while for each dish to come
this be a great place
always friendly and welcome
today -PRON- have a chill lemon bar for a mid day snack that be out of this world
-PRON- chai latte make fresh daily be a welcome departure from -PRON- usual morning latte ristretto latte with 1 sugar in the raw and a touch of cinnamon
-PRON- probably should not be say this publically but one day -PRON- ask darren to slice a homemade blueberry muffin and fry -PRON- in butter
-PRON- be really good
always good to try new thing
drive to vegas in the heat have make -PRON- reservation month in advanced
request early check in but instead -PRON- do not have -PRON- room ready until two after the normal time
-PRON- think the bad part be the crappy attitude the assistant manager have when -PRON- ask about -PRON-
plus -PRON- now change hotel guest for parking
and while the pillow case have be wash -PRON- could still see the trace of a blood stain
good shop in the valley
these guy have a full line up of skilled barber that have be do this for year
-PRON- come every two week for a fresh haircut
and -PRON- be never disappointed
today -PRON- come in 5 minute before close and these guy still take -PRON- time on -PRON- cut
-PRON- would recommend this place to anybody

-PRON- be a cool spot even if -PRON- be not a hipster dufus
the bartender craft a great cocktail
this be one of the only place with a nice selection of microbrew where -PRON- actually pass up the sculpin green flash dogfish head etc
to drink something yummy boozy and make with love
-PRON- be a must for first friday

-PRON- yard be everything -PRON- could have hop for
-PRON- have several quote for landscaping service for -PRON- yard and bill from aquarius beat -PRON- all
one thing -PRON- notice with -PRON- experience with other landscaper be that -PRON- be kind of flaky
not return call not show up when schedule
aquarius be always on time and very courteous
bill the owner of aquarius first come over and give some great idea for what -PRON- could do with -PRON- yard which be a great relief
-PRON- then go to the nursery to help -PRON- pick out plant and rock for the project
when the job start -PRON- crew show up on time and -PRON- be very fast and thorough
-PRON- do outstanding work and -PRON- neighbor be very impressed with the work aquarius do
-PRON- would highly recommend aquarius landscaping for any landscaping project
like everyone else have say the parking lot be a huge issue
although that be not smith 's fault
lol
this location be a few minute away from -PRON- house
so -PRON- be easily accessible
the store be always stock and -PRON- have pretty much everything -PRON- need
the employee be very friendly
the deli line can take a long time if -PRON- go during peak time
-PRON- usually go there first grab -PRON- number and then do -PRON- fruits\/veggie shopping while -PRON- wait for -PRON- number to be call
to get the good deal make sure -PRON- have a smith 's card and download the app
there be a bunch of digital coupon which -PRON- easily load onto -PRON- card

but -PRON- just do not get -PRON- -PRON- really do not
every little thing -PRON- order leave -PRON- wondering
steak come out swim in butter yes that be heavenly

-PRON- have never be here when -PRON- be the lied shelter so -PRON- do not have any comparison but -PRON- think this be one of the good shelter -PRON- have be to
at first glance -PRON- be overwhelming the dog part at least 20-odd building to go through and lot of walking so do not wear uncomfortable shoe
each of the building be air condition and the staff make a great effort to keep the door close even though while -PRON- be there many visitor would carelessly leave the door open keep the dog cool people
as other review state each dog have -PRON- own indoor and outdoor area separate by a doggy door and -PRON- seem to be very comfortable and happy
see the dog one row at a time help a lot -PRON- have be to shelter where -PRON- be in a gym size room with back to back row of dog and the cacophony of bark get overwhelming to say the least
-PRON- just go to look at dog and go through each and every building and kennel until come to the last one where -PRON- find a little ball of fur name felix who have a little old man face and huge fluffy paw
-PRON- really want a run buddy and
this 14 lb terrier do not seem to fit the bill so -PRON- hem and haw between -PRON- and a large dog and go home with neither the first day
the staff be very friendly -PRON- let -PRON- walk the dog around after give -PRON- license and play in little area
-PRON- could not get the little fluffy ball out of -PRON- mind so the next morning -PRON- come by and adopt -PRON-
a friend have tell -PRON- that the adoption rate be negotiable and maybe -PRON- be but in felix 's now name murray case -PRON- be not -PRON- have already be drop once because -PRON- be at the shelter for a few week
knowing -PRON- do not have much time
leave make -PRON- even happy to part with -PRON- $ 155 which thankfully include -PRON- neutering and vaccine
-PRON- be the good dog playful happy and after be groom -PRON- look more like a puppy than an old man

overdue review
upset
-PRON- would have receive a high rate but -PRON- have greatly dissapoint -PRON-
-PRON- go in for mother 's day and be rudely tell to leave because -PRON- only allow those who have make reservation ahead of time
-PRON- family have be go to -PRON- restaurant for quite awhile but to be treat that way be unacceptable
-PRON- should have put a sign up or even just explain -PRON- nicely to -PRON- would have work
bottom line
will not be go back
poor customer service
if possible -PRON- would give this place zero star
the staff be unfriendly
the venue be cheap and look not nearly as nice as the picture on -PRON- website
-PRON- spring a series of tip in the amount of $ 115 on -PRON- for the limo driver and minister
-PRON- be unorganized and keep try to rush thing so the next couple could get in and out
fortunately -PRON- have -PRON- wedding here as a joke before the real ceremony later this year just cuz -PRON- be in vegas but if this be the real deal -PRON- woulda walk out and forfeit -PRON- deposit in favor of go somewhere else
kai be a gem

but -PRON- read the review about how amazing kai be
so -PRON- want to try -PRON- for the holiday

first -PRON- adore -PRON- -PRON- be so sweet
then -PRON- make -PRON- feel so comfortable ask -PRON- what -PRON- be look for while also give -PRON- professional opinion which -PRON- love
then -PRON- deliver such beautiful lash
-PRON- ask -PRON- at first if -PRON- could go a little more natural then -PRON- would work up to a more drastic lash and -PRON- eyelash come out exactly how -PRON- have picture
well more
-PRON- could not be more happy with kai as an adorable sweetie but also because -PRON- be truly a master of -PRON- art

walk in and sit in the bar area at a high top for 4
there be just 2 of -PRON-
-PRON- be immediately greet by the bartender\/waiter and -PRON- be great
-PRON- be one of those waiter who do not need to write thing down or look at the menu to reference something
the place be hop but still at the noise lever where -PRON- could hear one another
-PRON- each have a soup to start and share a entree
there entree portion be definitely worth the price
-PRON- be build for 2 and the great waiter inform -PRON- of that
-PRON- have the lobster bisque and -PRON- have new england white clam chowder
-PRON- even have a fresh cooked clam of the half shell float on top
very elegant touch
for the entree -PRON- share fish and chip but instead of some dirty white fish -PRON- have shrimp
fry oyster be the other option
the batter be light and the fry be a mixture of sweet potato and traditional
a very nice touch
the most important thing be there be not a hint of grease on the plate
at high tide -PRON- get what -PRON- pay for
-PRON- walk out of there with a tab less then 50
and -PRON- each have a beer
-PRON- would highly recommend this place

-PRON- wife and -PRON- have be to ocotillo a few time and each time there be be something slightly negative that chip away at -PRON- experience
in all fairness -PRON- have enjoy the food but the service and the atmosphere have continue to free fall off of a cliff
whether -PRON- be the restaurant 's lackluster service or be seat at a table where the afternoon sun will burn -PRON- retina when there be an available shade table in the same section or the awful acoustic while try to have a relax dinner there be always something off
this evening be no exception
tonight -PRON- be treat for the last time most likely to a swarm of fly during -PRON- entire dinner
some crawling on the wall behind -PRON- a few hovering over -PRON- food a few brave one dare enough to land on -PRON- table and one pesky guy hang out on the cushion next to -PRON- while -PRON- eat wait for a crumb to drop
-PRON- be so bad that one of the server be stalk the restaurant with a fly zap gadget that resemble a small tennis racket that make an annoying buzz sound every time -PRON- smash -PRON- against the window to kill a fly which most of the time -PRON- be unsuccessful in
-PRON- be bad enough to have the fly zoom around -PRON- head in and out of -PRON- entree but to also have to see and hear -PRON- be kill while -PRON- eat be utterly disgusting
astonishingly when -PRON- bring this to the attention of -PRON- waitress -PRON- casually dismiss the reality of the situation without offer any kind of solution
-PRON- would have be one thing to address the problem and for the restaurant to offer some small token of apology or embarrassment over the situation or even a free dessert to go so -PRON- could enjoy -PRON- in -PRON- non fly infest home anything
but alas the problem as all problem at octotillo in the past have be be ignore
-PRON- actually leave the bag of food -PRON- box up for -PRON- under the table maybe -PRON- would attract the fly and everyone else would finally be able to enjoy -PRON- dinner but the waitress follow -PRON- out of the restaurant to make sure -PRON- take -PRON- home with -PRON- so -PRON- could put -PRON- in the garbage there
ps -PRON- have upload a few photo worth check out
nice store great inventory and very helpful staff
only downside be the location with heavy mall traffic and very busy parking lot
pet rescue adopt activity be great too
veggie xplosion
-PRON- be pretty sure everything on the menu be vegan
the warrior salad be delicious as well as the quinoa burger
great flavor
staff be friendly and excited price be high but worth the splurge consider ingredient quality
very nice people that work here
kim the general manager go out of -PRON- way to resolve a minor issue -PRON- have during -PRON- last visit
-PRON- will consider -PRON- in the future when -PRON- 02 m3 need service
the dish be very flavorful although -PRON- be not a fan of the tapas small plate
-PRON- favorite thing on the menu be -PRON- green magic mojito deeelish
one complaint be that although -PRON- have reservation for a group of 10 for a birthday -PRON- wait almost 1.5 hr for -PRON- table and the hostess be pretty rude when -PRON- inquire about -PRON-
-PRON- finally ask another server and be seat
this place have be bookmark for awhile
-PRON- husband and -PRON- order beer and have a question about a couple other
waitress be nice and give a sample of beer in question which ultimately end up with another beer purchase
where the dinner start fall apart be in the kitchen
-PRON- order a stuff burger medium well
the burger be raw and the waitress even comment about how raw the burger be and would send -PRON- back
apparently this happen several time this night as -PRON- say -PRON- have to send several burger back
when -PRON- burger finally come back out after another 20 minute -PRON- do not come with any aioli
additionally -PRON- give -PRON- regular fry on the 3rd attempt instead of sweet potato fry
-PRON- do not have time to try and get -PRON- right as -PRON- spend 1.5 hour get food and already have plan and need to quickly go
-PRON- have to leave after only eat a small portion of -PRON- food as -PRON- be run late for -PRON- next obligation
sadly a place -PRON- be really look forward to try end up be a place -PRON- will never go back to
copps be alright but -PRON- be expensive
-PRON- have a nice selection of produce but -PRON- meat price be high
visit this buffet for breakfast before the long ride home
the variety of food be nice
-PRON- enjoy some of the non breakfast food as well
-PRON- favorite thing be the french toast stick
-PRON- be not too impressed with the dessert counter though
-PRON- be easy to please but -PRON- just feel there be something lack there
-PRON- also feel like -PRON- could have expand in -PRON- asian cuisine section as well
all in all this place be sure to get the job do
-PRON- would not mind refuel here again
ok have a bad experience before but be back several time good food and good service
staff be friendly and a good double ipa
a four star rating for -PRON- cleaning quality
three star overall because -PRON- customer service be a bit strange
-PRON- be never greet when -PRON- come in and whenever -PRON- try to pay with -PRON- card -PRON- be give attitude by who over have to do the transaction
-PRON- get -PRON-
-PRON- guy prefer cash
relatively cheap
-PRON- will continue go here until -PRON- find somewhere else more convenient
this place be so much fun
-PRON- fly in super late at 12:30 am and go here straight from the airport at 1 am
surprisingly this place be super packed
there be different level for the game
so -PRON- be ideal for anyone even golf noob like -PRON-
although -PRON- do not try\/order any food -PRON- friend do and -PRON- all seem to enjoy the fry shrimp edamame and chicken skewer
great for group and a night out of a different kind of vegas fun :0
-PRON- have go to this location many time because -PRON- be very convenient
and -PRON- always order a triple espresso with caramel drizzle
-PRON- feel that this be a very simple order and not a soul in the world would be able to mess -PRON- up
apparently -PRON- be wrong on multiple occasion
yes -PRON- be -PRON- responsibility to let -PRON- know if -PRON- order be wrong
but -PRON- think that someone who get a triple espresso wrong multiple time should not be work at a coffee shop
not only that but each time -PRON- have receive two shot instead of three
-PRON- be never go there again
in n out rock
what else can -PRON- say
there be always always a super duper long line here in the drive thru and sometimes -PRON- wait for 10 minute and sometimes up to 30
but -PRON- know that information go in
-PRON- always have to wait at in n out and that be because -PRON- be all make to order
at least the wait be not as long as fatburger
employee be nice and -PRON- be a good location -PRON- can drive in and out easily
fantastic resort if -PRON- have kid or not
this time share have the use of all the facility at the westin next door
but -PRON- probably will not bother
the pool be nice here the service poolside be great the bar be good and decent food option
the cabana by the pool be a nice touch and can be book
ice cream for $ 2 every afternoon from 2 4
french fry basket for the kid be a good option at $ 6
-PRON- also do a nice bbq pizza
so -PRON- friend have use jason in the past but this be -PRON- first time meet -PRON-
more than just get -PRON- an excellent deal on bottle service\/table and get -PRON- in super quick -PRON- be a genuinely nice guy
really easy person to relate to and just a nice human being

wow
oh richardson's -PRON- never cease to impress -PRON-
-PRON- be there tonight for -PRON- mother 's birthday with -PRON- brother sister in law niece nephew surprisingly enough -PRON- be pretty dead
this be the first time -PRON- have be to the new location have not be to the previous location in at least a year and even though some lady come in say oh -PRON- be so different
but so similar"
(doesn't make a whole lot of sense)
-PRON- look pretty much identical to the previous location cozy seating all pretty sure there be extra seating on the side as well
the hostess be nice sit -PRON- as soon as -PRON- full party be there
-PRON- start off with the chip guac which be pretty fantastic spicy as well
but -PRON- love a good kick to -PRON- food the pinot noir which be fabulous good pinot
-PRON- have have in a while
-PRON- then proceed to split the blackened salmon with pineapple salsa -PRON- mother -PRON- with the mixed veggie potato stuff green chile two side salad
two side salad be definitely not require
they're huge as be the portion typically serve at richardson 's
-PRON- be delicious
-PRON- be not sure where previous yelper have note -PRON- only have one dessert as -PRON- have not only the flan but the sopapilla as well which be prepare perfectly not too doughy not too tough
absolutely great end to the meal
overall great experience
the server be extremely patient with -PRON- as -PRON- request thing frequently be lay back while be attentive at the same time
if ya have not be go
-PRON- be a great atmosphere for a date -PRON- can not wait to go back once the weather 's cool off to enjoy the patio
-PRON- love this restaurant
the food be great service be awsome and the drink be stout
this place have a great feel to -PRON-
only person -PRON- deal with be anthony pancurak -PRON- be the lead consultant an -PRON- phone specialist
massive change in property management since -PRON- move in
the only helpful person in the office be now quan
-PRON- have have stuff steal out of -PRON- cars(think state issue handicapped placard by unruly teenager
the quality of people -PRON- be allow in the complex have certainly decrease
-PRON- no longer feel safe where -PRON- live
-PRON- finally go to arsenal cider house last night
-PRON- have be drink arsenal around the city for year so be excited to finally go
-PRON- get the plum cider perfect if -PRON- do not like -PRON- too sweet
the price be steep for a small amount of cider but the alcohol content be high and of course -PRON- be all very delicious
so -PRON- suppose that be worth -PRON-
-PRON- be 6 on a thursday evening and the garden seating be all take
-PRON- be pretty aggravating actually because there be six 12-top table out back that be square with bench as seating
if -PRON- be go with only two or three in -PRON- group -PRON- be awkward
half of the table be take by couple but because the table be square and not community style long table -PRON- really can not share a table with stranger
very wasteful
put some bistro table in the back and -PRON- would be ideal
the space out there be very nice and seclude
-PRON- end up sit at a standalone bench and chug -PRON- cider so that -PRON- could walk down to butler street and drink arsenal cider at a bar with good seating
-PRON- just go to rippingtons for the first time in many year and have a great meal
-PRON- be there for brunch on sunday at around 11 be and no wait
pro great ambiance in downtown waxhaw in a cute historic building
food be good
reasonable price
con
service be a little lacking in term of be slow with refills\/check to see if -PRON- need refill and bring -PRON- check
limited menu for brunch
but -PRON- be pleased overall and will definitely be go back
the buffet at wynn be one of more decent buffet on the vegas strip
-PRON- be not as good as the bellagio buffet and -PRON- be definitely not as good as -PRON- personal favorite the village seafood buffet at the rio
with all thing consider however -PRON- think the wynn buffet be satisfactory at good
-PRON- have be to the wynn buffet a few time in the past and this time -PRON- go for -PRON- sunday brunch
there be nothing too special here same decently good food that -PRON- would find at any other $ 35 vegas buffet
-PRON- do like -PRON- omelet bar very fresh ingredient pleasant omelet chef
-PRON- feel the chinese porridge section be a little out of place although -PRON- must admit that -PRON- be very pleasantly surprised
suck that there be a server who make -PRON- porridge so -PRON- barely put any thousand year egg in there -PRON- favorite topping for chinese porridge
all in all wynn be a pretty good buffet for the brunch price especially if -PRON- have a few glass of champagne
would -PRON- choose this buffet over the one at bellagio or the seafood one at rio
never

-PRON- have no idea why the place be half empty every time -PRON- come around
-PRON- may reroute some culturally confused customer from local generic alladin 's to go try some real middle east at -PRON- be good

this place be amazing
-PRON- be so comfortable with excellent service and wonderful food

-PRON- price be unbeatable and -PRON- work ethic be above and beyond today 's world
-PRON- hold customer service to a very high standard and -PRON- go beyond what -PRON- expect
-PRON- really can not cook breakfast at home any cheap
the combo of egg and meat home fry toast and coffee for about or under 5 buck be amazing
add extra side for a buck or two
and the menu be much more extensive for anyone who so desire or if -PRON- go for lunch or dinner sandwich soup burger and other greek -orient dish be serve to -PRON- table promptly and in a friendly manner
too bad there be not something similar near home here in glendale but -PRON- would be doubtless more crowded more expensive and much more annoying
this place be neither
canadians somehow seem so mellow and civilized
yum
to the food
and the canadians
do not ask
-PRON- be partial to these old school italian place
if -PRON- could have one meal in this world -PRON- be rico 's surf and turf a rico 's salad and a side of garlic spaghetti
-PRON- be -PRON- favorite place in the city
-PRON- really enjoy -PRON- stay at hotel 32
the room be very nice
-PRON- be not as big as the penthouse at new york new york and -PRON- be twice as expensive but certain feature like the spa tub and shower be much nice
however there be only the one bathroom in the hotel 32 loft where the penthouse at new york new york have two which can be a very nice feature when travel with a companion
the limo service that be provide for loft room and above be also very nice
-PRON- driver gary be very friendly and very helpful
-PRON- go to the wrong baggage terminal and -PRON- help sort -PRON- out and get -PRON- to the correct baggage pickup area and over to the hotel while have a terrific attitude the whole time
-PRON- be very outgoing and friendly and really set the bar high for the rest of the staff to live up to
there be a few hiccup once -PRON- arrive at the hotel the bellhop be have difficulty confirm -PRON- reservation and ask -PRON- to wait in the vip lounge which be really just a room with a couch while -PRON- sort -PRON- out
after sit for 10 minute -PRON- go up to the clerk at the desk and explain the situation
within minute -PRON- be able confirm that -PRON- room be ready and give -PRON- a pass key for the elevator so that -PRON- could go up to floor 32
-PRON- step out of the vip lounge and speak with the bellhop who be still try to sort thing out on -PRON- and tell -PRON- -PRON- have sort thing out -PRON-
after check in -PRON- have to ask for ash tray 3 time and make -PRON- aware that -PRON- have ask 3 time before -PRON- actually get -PRON- deliver to -PRON- room
the front desk of hotel 32 be only available until 9 p.m.
if -PRON- need anything after that -PRON- be kind of out of luck
like the bag of ice -PRON- request
-PRON- have to argue with the monte carlo 's front desk to get the ice for -PRON- at which point -PRON- tell -PRON- there would be a delivery fee for the ice to be deliver to -PRON- room
after explain -PRON- be at hotel 32 on the top floor and there be no ice machine available for -PRON- to get -PRON- own ice -PRON- tell -PRON- that be a housekeeping issue and to call -PRON-
45 minute later -PRON- be deliver an ice bucket without any ice and have to explain to the poor house keeper that -PRON- need ice not an ice bucket -PRON- then finally get the bag of ice 10 minute later
the blu ray player work once and then -PRON- keep freeze
-PRON- have to call maintenance to remove the disc and fix -PRON-
the very next night -PRON- break again
half of the pixel in the main tv be fade which make -PRON- look like there be stain inside of the tv
the room service housekeeping valet and maintenance staff be all very pleasant except for the man stock the mini fridge who argue that the privacy sign be not on eventually -PRON- realize -PRON- be on
-PRON- be not until the argument with the person check the mini fridge that who wake -PRON- up from -PRON- nap that -PRON- finally take all of the issue up to the person work the hotel 32 reception area
-PRON- manager be not in but be very apologetic and sympathetic to -PRON- aggravation over the issue that have happen
the manager -PRON- believe -PRON- name be adam call -PRON- within an hour of receive -PRON- complaint
as compensation -PRON- offer to remove the daily resort fee as well as offer two cop to meal that be charge to the room both meal be about $ 40 each
the lounge area have a very limited selection of food
if -PRON- do not like the one hot item that be offer -PRON- be limit to fruit or granola
example -PRON- have slider one night and when -PRON- request for a slider without the sauce -PRON- be tell that be not an option
on the plus side there be always plenty of bottled water and soda available
all thing consider if the price be less -PRON- would definitely stay at hotel 32 again but -PRON- would not stay there again for the same price mainly because -PRON- feel that -PRON- fail to deliver on the promise of a pampered experience with issue free customer service which be -PRON- main selling point
want to check out the sukiyaki
for what -PRON- get the taste be good but lack in quantity
the portion have 95 rice and 5 sukiyaki

-PRON- be not meaty
so -PRON- will be a long time come before go back to willee 's
-PRON- have very mixed feeling about this place
-PRON- spend $ 30 on next to nothing for lunch and be disappoint by the savory
$ 20 go to slim cold sandwich that be tasteless and just unsatisfy in every way
the chocolate cake and almond croissant redeem the special trip to caesar be just to try payard
with so many option on the strip -PRON- be not sure -PRON- will be back but -PRON- would grab another slice of cake if -PRON- be to pass by again
the good crab cake and grill chicken ceasar salad
definately a place to visit in phoenix
come in with -PRON- family not know what -PRON- can eat on -PRON- very strict diet but order a taco salad with grill chicken instead and most everything else remove include the dressing
chef hector offer to hand make a salsa especially for -PRON- and add extra veggie so -PRON- salad would not be so plain
-PRON- be very impressed with -PRON- -PRON- willingness and -PRON- service with a smile

-PRON- be almost $ 10 for a tiny unsatisiying sandwich

overall -PRON- would not pay again very little food for the huge price
the service be okay beer be even $ 7 for a 20 oz draft
total ripoff subpar food not a lot of amount for the price -PRON- pay
for the record -PRON- do not mind pay for food if -PRON- be get -PRON- money 's worth
the pizza be kind of lukewarm and the sandwich be cold
-PRON- will not be return and suggest -PRON- do not go either
also -PRON- get the groupon -PRON- come as a group of 4
-PRON- want 2 separate check
most other place have let -PRON- sit at the same table and use a groupon on separate check not here
-PRON- would not let -PRON- use -PRON- unless -PRON- sit at different table

-PRON- love eel and -PRON- really nice that -PRON- offer -PRON-
staff be very friendly and a nice place to just stop by and grab a quick bento
-PRON- technician 's hand smell like cigarette
-PRON- think -PRON- be unsanitary to not wash -PRON- hand before handle someone 's nail
after cut -PRON- cuticle -PRON- place the scissor back in -PRON- protector case -PRON- do not see any sanitation device or alcohol nearby and know -PRON- do -PRON- nail right after another client
the shellac be also not do smoothly and the colour be taint in a few day

the hefeweizen be tasty the crowd be awesome and more townie than anything on the strip and -PRON- have a blast
nothing like dance in booth while drink out of a giant mug big than -PRON- head
obnoxious
-PRON- waitress be a giant pain in the arse and would not let -PRON- use more than one credit card even though -PRON- initially have tell -PRON- -PRON- could
-PRON- also complain about -PRON- tip -PRON- do not order food and people be not happy with -PRON- so kill -PRON- for tip 15
also hofbrauhaus close at midnight- what bar close at midnight in vegas
not sure if the lawyer here talk so much because -PRON- set a price for -PRON- service and do not mind take time or be bill by the hour and so feel fit to fleece -PRON- client
waste of client time if former immense scam if latter
the price -PRON- quote for basic stuff like estate filing and formation of llc and such be insanely expensive llc formation quote at nearly $ 3000
david brown be nice to talk to face to face but that be not why -PRON- be with -PRON-
-PRON- lackey be open money grabber
the office lose paperwork or delay procedural stuff
do not respond to email and voice message
the assistants\/para legal give conflict information
excuse for all of the above someone be not in the office that day or someone move the file around
unprofessional from top to bottom of -PRON- hierarchy

-PRON- always get good food
-PRON- husband do not really like chinese food
but -PRON- love the orange chicken and the honey walnut shrimp
be sure to ask for the fortune cookie as sometimes -PRON- have forget but -PRON- sure make up for that the next time
come here per recommendation from a friend and all -PRON- can say be that -PRON- be ok
service be ok
lot of dish to choose from on the menu
but -PRON- could also be an eyesore
the price be ridiculous
and -PRON- be just be honest
-PRON- have eat at many filipino restaurant and this by far have be the most expensive one yet
consider the amount that -PRON- get
-PRON- be truly expect a big bowl for those price
do not get -PRON- wrong the food be awesome -PRON- order kare kare and diniguan
the oxtail in the kare kare be scarce
and -PRON- be about $ 15
-PRON- also get -PRON- thai tea boba and -PRON- taste nothing like -PRON-
-PRON- probably would give this place another shot but stick to the cheap dish
-PRON- have be to this restaurant several time and -PRON- seem here quality have go down hill
after the sloppy lasagna -PRON- get last time i figure -PRON- would give -PRON- another chance but only time find -PRON- have slip even further
-PRON- will not be back for a third rip off
price be way to high
amanda always know what -PRON- want

the store -PRON- be more on the country charm side
there be a couple table so -PRON- can have -PRON- sandwich there
-PRON- carry jam and miscellaneous stuff perfect for last minute gift
--cost-- a little more than traditional grocery store but -PRON- be fine with that
quality ingredient make from scratch

anytime -PRON- come here -PRON- feed and fatten -PRON- up offer a slice more like a hunk of bread and butter

chamango from vegas
the chamango -PRON- pick up be tasty
although the first time -PRON- come here the mango be hard and sour
-PRON- be not the deali o
-PRON- also forget a straw the first time around
second time around
damn good
the mango be super sweet
soft
delicious
and -PRON- ask for a straw
but -PRON- do this gesture with the lady that make -PRON- look like -PRON- be ask for a joint
eventually -PRON- figure -PRON- out and decide to start point instead
for those who do not know how to say straw in spanish -PRON- be popote
so -PRON- find the trick to eat this on the way back from vegas to cali
-PRON- let the ice cream sorbet melt a bit
eat the tamarind stick first
then dive into the mango get bit of that ice cream and chamoy sauce
let -PRON- melt some more on the drive
then when -PRON- look like -PRON- slushy drink -PRON- from the straw

the restaurant hash house a go go be worth every penny

-PRON- definitely find a vet for all -PRON- future fur baby
walk in here for a late lunch last saturday
stand wait for someone anyone
to seat -PRON-
or even greet -PRON-
someone be rustle around in the back but obviously do not see or hear -PRON-
wait for what feel like way too long and walk out
maybe -PRON- should invest in a bell on the door
seriously even a $ 2 jingle bell would work
lose -PRON- business and go to thai basil instead
great service
super professional on time and excellent pricing
-PRON- have -PRON- install a 240v outlet for an electric vehicle and the project come out great and at a fraction of the cost some of the large company quote
-PRON- also love the fact that this be a locally own small business and will be reach to to prodigy for any future electrical work that -PRON- need do
-PRON- take -PRON- first trip to this restaurant a couple of week ago and think -PRON- be great
-PRON- be a classic place that have be do thing the same way since -PRON- have open
if -PRON- be look for a diet friendly place this be probably not the place for -PRON- no gluten free or whole wheat pasta but if -PRON- be just look for a classic italian place this be the perfect place
each meal come with unlimited wine- red and white soup or salad garlic bread and a cappuccino
the environment be really fun and eclectic and the garlic bread be some of the good -PRON- have have
the chicken cacciatore -PRON- get be just okay but the sausage pasta -PRON- step dad order be really delicious as well as the eggplant parmesan
service be really fast friendly efficient and the price be reasonable for what -PRON- get
-PRON- will probably have to wait to get a table but -PRON- be a vegas staple and somewhat hidden secret from what -PRON- understand
-PRON- be a fun and novel place with classic italian food
-PRON- be a fun night
-PRON- would give -PRON- 3 star base on the meal -PRON- order but the overall spirit of the place give -PRON- an extra star

-PRON- adore jean phillipe
everything here be so decadent and have such great presentation but -PRON- fave location be the bellagio one
this one be more spaced out then the former but i do not feel -PRON- serve the same goody as the bellagio do extra point for have a dining area
the dulce de leche gelato be to die for the chocalate chip cookie be heaven as well as the sugar cookie
next time i ust try the crepe -PRON- look to delish
do not go here if -PRON- want service
the server be impossible to get service from
when -PRON- do finally order -PRON- wait an hour and a half for nachos just to hear that -PRON- give -PRON- order away to another table".wait another 30 min
finally get -PRON- order
then when the bill come not even comp or discount
excellent deli
have the pastrami- melt in -PRON- mouth
eric do an awesome job serve -PRON- table
glad canter be make -PRON- to vegas
be drive through port credit today and have a craving for an italian style sandwich
a quick perusal of the insauga.com top 5 list for good italian sandwich suggest this place as the number one of -PRON- kind in mississauga
be forewarn though none of the store in the little non descript plaza -PRON- reside in have any signage so put -PRON- trust in google map and -PRON- should be fine
if -PRON- pass the hasty market -PRON- have go too far
walk in to find friendly staff and a clean simple atmosphere with a minimalist approach to decor
two high table and some chair pretty much round -PRON- out
cashier and the store manager be both friendly easy to talk to and willing to make suggestion
try the veal sandwich around 9 dollar topping extra within a few minute out come a humongous saucy and great tasting sandwich load with onion and sweet pepper and cheese
tasty fill and lot of sautéed onion which be great
-PRON- have not try on a bun or some of the other locally acclaim choice
so -PRON- be not in a position to compare
but saucy kytchen certainly do not dissapoint
would go back and if -PRON- could make a suggestion go there on an empty stomach
-PRON- allow -PRON- friend and -PRON- to stack beer bottle three to four deep the length of the booth
no other place allow this
there have to be some kind of danger in this
but -PRON- seem as if no one care
probably ask why do this
do not have a specific answer but for the fact that -PRON- be fun and usually a good conversation starter to folk who wander by -PRON- booth
so yeah
the service be a little slow but -PRON- be pay a dollar for coor light
-PRON- be not like -PRON- be drink a craft beer listening to the lumineer -PRON- stupid hipster
get over the slow service and go somewhere else
allow the loyal customer to get serve faster
as for the food
order the sweet heat and honey chargrill wing
-PRON- will not be disappoint
-PRON- be draw to this restaurant because of the awesome patio but end up leave before order because -PRON- be so dirty and quite rundown inside
the table next to -PRON- be stack with dirty dish that nobody bother to clear the whole 15 20 minute -PRON- be there
the dish that -PRON- have bring to -PRON- be greasy and have not be clean properly
straw rapper and garbage litter the upstairs patio floor -PRON- be there for brunch not after the bar
-PRON- finish -PRON- coffee and leave because -PRON- no longer have an apatite
three star may not seem like a rave review but since -PRON- be not a huge beer drinker do not go to bar to watch sport and prefer ethnic food over food from the mother land three star from -PRON- mean that g&d be do something right
-PRON- husband and -PRON- meet -PRON- uncle and aunt for dinner here on labor day
-PRON- be surprised that -PRON- be even open and -PRON- be definitely slow because pretty much every server be stand outside smoking when -PRON- arrive
not that -PRON- be judge because as a former server -PRON- can tell -PRON- that there be nothing bad than work a shift on a holiday especially when -PRON- be more of a grilling and have people over type of holiday
anyway -PRON- sit in the bar area in one of the extraordinarily comfortable booth
the booth directly face the bar and be much more inviting than the somewhat close off dining area on the right
to drink -PRON- have a bloody mary
-PRON- be pleased that -PRON- server ask how spicy -PRON- want -PRON- since that mean -PRON- would be make from scratch and even more pleased when -PRON- taste -PRON- and find -PRON- to be delicious
-PRON- could really taste all the individual ingredient include the oft neglect horseradish and -PRON- really hit the spot after a long weekend of drinking
-PRON- also try -PRON- aunt 's long island and -PRON- be really good and not too sweet
-PRON- husband and -PRON- split the english dip and the philly cheese steak
neither be particularly good
-PRON- think -PRON- both err in not order british classic because -PRON- uncle 's shepherd pie be at least hearty and sort of the quintessential comfort food
-PRON- aunt 's fish and chip be also decent although -PRON- say -PRON- be not nearly as good as rosie mccaffey 's
-PRON- be definitely not opposed to come back here especially for no country karaoke on monday night
do that mean -PRON- can not sing martina mcbride
however when -PRON- do return -PRON- be go to stick to drinking -PRON- will gladly have another of those bloody marys and then after a few drink try one of the british pub dish
after all -PRON- be after a few drink that carb heavy and fill pub food really serve -PRON- true purpose
side dish be good and ample choice of -PRON- but the sushi white tuna yellowtail be not good
uni be not available
have good sushi in other place
staff be extremely nice but the bulb be subpar
really do not leave with a great tan after several visit
-PRON- have be want to try mama lupitas because of all the wonderful review -PRON- have read on here
the food be fairly good -PRON- would not say -PRON- be the good mexican -PRON- have ever have but still quite tasty
however the chip and salsa be absolutely phenomenal
the salsa be nice and spicy
the downfall be that -PRON- service be absolutely horrible
-PRON- do not know if -PRON- have a waitress who be new or just do not care
-PRON- have read many review that say what great service -PRON- have receive so -PRON- understand this be rare
the waitress seem to be in no hurry there be only four table in the restaurant and still incredibly slow
-PRON- may give this place
another try sometime but the service really diminish -PRON- experience
-PRON- love the bed at the ritz
-PRON- be just the good
very thankful on this very cold and snowy weekend that the ritz be attach to tower city and the horseshoe casino
cleveland ritz keep true to the amazing service the ritz be know for
-PRON- husband and -PRON- take an in town vacation to celebrate -PRON- birthday and the ritz be the perfect place
horrible
-PRON- smell weird
the philly be bland and nothing special and -PRON- make the mistake if order mozzarella stick that seem microwave
will not ever be back
disappear server empty salad bar cold pão de queijo cheese bread cheap quality meat and ill prepared meat be just a few of the serious problem that plague this location
the one by the hughes center be way good than this downtown summerlin location
-PRON- wonder why -PRON- be so easy to snag a reservation for 4 on a busy friday night
-PRON- be hop that mean the word be get out about how crappy this location be
-PRON- could not believe how empty the salad bar be
there be hardly anything available
mostly just piece of lettuce and fruit fan out in a pitiful attempt to hide the fact that there be miss platter of food item
-PRON- be like -PRON- have the bare minimum that be require by the franchise
for shame
the service be among some of the bad -PRON- have ever have anywhere
-PRON- guy drop off water drink and a few of the freebie side dish and then disappear never to be see again
do -PRON- quit
go out to smoke and get run over by a bus
who know
the meat gauchos be not any good
while personable -PRON- be like pull tooth to get -PRON- to stop by -PRON- table
-PRON- have to beg for some of the ribeye and filet and even then -PRON- be give slice so small that -PRON- could eat it in one bite
-PRON- understand those be expensive meat but when all -PRON- bring out of the kitchen be the chicken thigh and sausage -PRON- start to annoy -PRON-
this be not a cheap meal by any mean
but -PRON- feel like the restaurant be try desperately to save as much money as possible at -PRON- expense
the meat -PRON- do manage to get serve be tough and either sorely undercooked or overcook
the house sirloin be as tough as shoe leather
nobody at -PRON- table could cut the dang thing and -PRON- chew so much
-PRON- think -PRON- be go to have to go get a set of denture afterwards
the house special end up be spit into a napkin
the freebie side dish be an afterthought
everybody love those little cheesy puff of deliciousness the pão de queijo but -PRON- small basket be super stingy two for -PRON- table of four adult
add insult to injury -PRON- be serve cold and never replenish
as -PRON- sit and write this review -PRON- get even more angry and upset about this entire dining experience
-PRON- be horrible
so bad that -PRON- have zero interest in ever set foot in any fogo de chao again
will never ever go back to this location and -PRON- will shout from the rooftop to everyone -PRON- see so -PRON- will not spend -PRON- money at this disastrous restaurant
very very entertaining
lot and lot to see be sure -PRON- be seat at least three row from the front as -PRON- will be tilt -PRON- head back to view acrobatic all night
however the theater be not that big
so do not feel the need to spring for crazy expensive or high seat
the story can be a little difficult to follow so be sure -PRON- be pay attention no one really speak
the performer be incredible
definitely worth see a clean show with lot of entertainment and excitement
this be an amazing minor league ball park
nearby parking or take the light rail and walk a five block
a wide entrance with reasonable security wanding and bag inspection
lot and lot of concession choice include the usual hot dog and pretzel but also barbecue and local craft beer
and a simply amazing sunset view
unbelievable
-PRON- be in a suite where -PRON- friend get free ticket from one of -PRON- vendor
so maybe that influence -PRON- experience somewhat
four hot dog and two beer $ 35
seem a bit much but that be ballpark price
oh the game
-PRON- nearly forget
a great view and lot of activity go on to keep fan interested
bb&t ballpark have the usual race in the middle of the game
where miller park race sausage and nationals park race president here -PRON- race royalty with queen charlotte a king a joker and a knight
funny
queen charlotte win the race tonight carry a sign that say girl power
the place be a little difficult to find but once -PRON- get here -PRON- be definitely worth the drive
-PRON- get the green revolution smoothie and -PRON- be pretty good
-PRON- would for sure come back here again next time
-PRON- be in vegas

-PRON- parent seem to love this place
but after meet -PRON- there for lunch today -PRON- can not understand why
the restaurant style be definitely unique
the front section be so wonderfully bright and spacious
-PRON- be lead towards the back which end up look like a disco cave
so very dark and mirror
though -PRON- believe décor do not mean anything when -PRON- come to food
most of the time
the waiter come and haphazardly set the table with plate that have a dirty film on -PRON-
thankfully -PRON- do not need -PRON- for the soup -PRON- order
the large book style menu need updating as -PRON- have see good day perhaps 10 year ago
the pho -PRON- order be just fine
more expensive than most other place
the brisket be also fatty than -PRON- be use to
originally -PRON- be look to order the shrimp dumpl noodle soup but -PRON- have run out of dumpling by noon on a sunday
-PRON- all have to alter -PRON- order because of this
on a positive note the fry dough stick be nice and crispy
despite the crispy stick -PRON- will not be back to ben thanh
-PRON- boyfriend and -PRON- be in nc for a wedding and be stay at the double tree hotel
not know where to grab lunch -PRON- head to manzetti 's
-PRON- be very happy with -PRON- choice
-PRON- server be excellent and personable
-PRON- even recomend some great wine
-PRON- be in for lunch so -PRON- have oyst shooter good idea but oyster -PRON- taste like -PRON- be can
maybe -PRON- be use to fresh west coast oyster
not sure the shrimp blt and the club
both be excellent
-PRON- would recommend this place to anyone who want a diverse menu with easy go ambiance and great customer service
wynn and encore be so posh walk thru -PRON- be a vicarious way to see how the well to do life
there be a small waterfall in front of the wynn which -PRON- always walk past on -PRON- way from the palazzo street corner past the wynn to fashion show mall
never think -PRON- could be true of -PRON- beloved burrito chain but really everyone on yelp be spot on this chipotle suck
-PRON- make the bad food here
-PRON- burrito be so overstuff and soggy -PRON- fall apart before -PRON- be even finish
-PRON- be not friendly at all
and -PRON- can not keep up with the lunch rush often time butt in with phone\/internet order of 5 10 item have -PRON- stand and wait right in front of -PRON-
line be 15 people deep when -PRON- arrive and 25 by the time -PRON- leave go right out the door
and since -PRON- wait nearly 30 minute -PRON- can not imagine what those folk be in store for
can not even stock the napkin either
build a back counter operation for -PRON- pickup order -PRON- dummy
for what -PRON- be a mexican centric market -PRON- be great
the produce be always clean and organized
regularly have great sale on the meat -PRON- favorite part about this grocery store
try the marinate boneless chicken thigh to take home and grill up
also the pastor meat be really good
can -PRON- tell -PRON- regularly have taco night at -PRON- house
go to the cheese\/deli section and get a couple scoop of mexican less salty and central american saltier cream for -PRON- american style taco or nachos way more flavor than american sour cream
fresh well price produce
sometimes have long checkout line good hot food\/restaurant section too
-PRON- often grab an agua fresca to drink while -PRON- shop
combo plate be good -PRON- really like -PRON- chili and cheese tamale
excellent place to chill work in a nice location on walnut street in shadyside
usually play good music but tonight -PRON- almost steal the guy headphone next to -PRON- to save -PRON- from the way too singy song writingly song
-PRON- know what -PRON- mean
-PRON- feel like -PRON- owe -PRON- to the manager here to add to the review above with an update comment about the queen rock music day for the last 5 hour
loll awesome
-PRON- just adjust -PRON- review from 3 to 4 star
-PRON- go here at least once every 2 week and find the food very tasty and usually present nicely
the kalbi beef rib a must also the fish taco
-PRON- do indulge one cocktail and enjoy the 808 lychee martini
good to past on the lamb pop just a one chunk of lamb cube on a stick dry and chewy
the sashimi salad come with plenty of sashimi
yes lot of roll be or have deep fry tempura or deep fry crab but a lot of other sushi place -PRON- have be too have similiar type of sushi roll
good deal with a groupon which can not be use for happy hour but fyi happy hour menu be slightly different
service be usually prompt small place so big party usually get the high top table which be bad for elderly and\/or handicap unaccessible
fyi 808 ceviche need a small spoon to scoop out the mango shrimp goodness besides use the taro chip -PRON- come with
-PRON- move from santee to hillcrest yesterday
-PRON- call cox on the 2nd of january to have -PRON- service ready for -PRON- move in on the 6th
on the 7th -PRON- attempt to use -PRON- internet and be not able to
-PRON- call technical service only to find that on the 3rd note be put in say a physical person need to come to -PRON- address to check the equipment and turn -PRON- on because -PRON- new residence have not use -PRON- service in 12 month or more
-PRON- do not notify -PRON- about this
-PRON- speak with 2 manager who apparently have no authority to fix anything
-PRON- also refuse to send anyone on monday to fix the situation because -PRON- do not have someone available and can not ask someone to come early or late on monday
-PRON- husband work from home and could get in serious trouble for not have internet access
no offer of financial compensation or discount be offer and -PRON- refuse to acknowledge -PRON- mess up by not notify -PRON- of this problem
avoid -PRON- at all cost of -PRON- can
after suffer through food that be at good mediocre burn calamari so call grill duck which be actually a duck grill cheese and bland squash soup -PRON- cousin friend and -PRON- leave -PRON- husband to grab the bill while -PRON- make -PRON- way to the bathroom before the long ride home
whilst in the washroom -PRON- end up squish into one of the unisex stall to read the plethora of scribble write behind the door
once do read and take a couple picture of the funny saying who can not relate to this the clearly napoleon- complexed manager be await -PRON- outside swearing and yell at -PRON- 3 girl for supposedly engage in inappropriate disgusting sexual behavior in his restaurant and tell -PRON- to pay and get out
ironic come from a restaurant with a pumpkin carve with glory hole on -PRON- twitter page
-PRON- be visibly confused and try to explain what happen but be meet with nothing but insult
may -PRON- add -PRON- be well educate well pay woman between 25 30 year old and do not engage in -PRON- insult and screaming online review be more effective anyhow
this have be the bad most insulting experience in the service industry that -PRON- have ever have
do not waste -PRON- money on this place
good ratio of viet customer and white people
-PRON- love that the owner be true viet and not chinese
come here on sunday at 520pm
glad -PRON- come early because by 540 there be a crowd at the door
the service be slow get -PRON- food 20min later
but -PRON- be busy
so -PRON- can not blame the only 2 dude work
get a small pho with rare beef and beef ball
the rare beef be actually rare and not frozen
yay
the broth be lovely -PRON- be light and not oily
the downfall be there be barely any noodle in the bowl
finish -PRON- in a good 5 big bite
a little dissapointed as -PRON- have read in other review that -PRON- have big portion
-PRON- also have soda xi muoi which be a plus for -PRON-
will come again and try the bbh
-PRON- confess
-PRON- be passionate about pie and other freshly bake delicacy
as a kid grow up in los angeles everyone seem to have a favorite neighborhood bakery that be so special that -PRON- mouth would water just think about -PRON-
for pie and great breakfast
-PRON- go to place be always du par and remain so for more than 40 year
now -PRON- family live in vegas and what pass for a piece of pie be often find at a buffet and -PRON- be usually pretty awful
imagine -PRON- delight when -PRON- discover du par
have recently less than 2 month ago open in the suncoast casino on alta and be open 24\/7
a recent visit confirm that -PRON- pie still have no equal
-PRON- also feature great breakfast item 24 hour a day but on -PRON- visit -PRON- decide to try some dish -PRON- normally would not order at a coffee shop
-PRON- have salmon and a new york steak dinner
-PRON- could not have be happy
salad be fresh and crisp
vegetable be just right not overdo and mushy
-PRON- baked potato be pip hot and cook perfectly and -PRON- steak be one of the tender and most flavorful -PRON- have ever have
-PRON- taste -PRON- wife 's salmon to see what -PRON- be rave about and -PRON- too be perfectly execute and delicious
the good part
-PRON- have a great steak salad vegetable potato coffee and an incredible piece of pie for less than the price of an ala carte steak at a steakhouse
-PRON- love save the money and no -PRON- do not miss the candle and tablecloth a bit
another great store manage by toni
small space and more clothing less jewelry but great unique trendy clothing that be not sell in every other store in town
kathy be amazing and -PRON- be refreshing to find a really nice store in old town not another jewelry store that look like everything else around
now -PRON- need an alixandra collection store in north scottsdale

good than most vietnamese restaurant in westminster
-PRON- pork spring roll be so delicious
-PRON- kid can not get enough of -PRON-
-PRON- come here three time
-PRON- love the place with the traditional and consistence food
-PRON- take away one star because the service for -PRON- be spotty
the host at the front be not too polite whether -PRON- have reservation or not
some waiter be more attentive than other
the cooking be always to perfection but the flavoring can be a little bit more bold
slightly on the expensive side but -PRON- be worth the experience and food
1st time breakfast lemon pancake
for -PRON- this pancake be slightly denser and dryer than -PRON- would like
the flavor be very vanilla and hint of lemon not too lemon
y which -PRON- prefer but if -PRON- like the lemon flavor to hit -PRON- hard this be not for -PRON-
smoked salmon benedict
-PRON- love this plate
the english muffin be crisp buttery and light
the smoked salmon be generous egg yolk be just the right consistency runny and the hollandaise sauce be amazing
2nd time lunch lemon salmon both the salmon and vegetable be cook to perfection but slightly bland on the flavor profile
3rd time dinner filet mignon merlot cook to perfection ask for medium and the red wine sauce be delicious
mussel martiniere
wow the broth have such a deep flavor the white wine sea and butter
creme brulee so delicious -PRON- be very vanilla like and lite custard do not taste like eggy cake
one of the good -PRON- try
-PRON- have be go to this office for a few year
russell be so good
-PRON- be great at discern the issue and diffuse the intense emotion in session
-PRON- be funny and pleasant to be with
-PRON- have help -PRON- so much
-PRON- highly recommend -PRON-
when -PRON- go to a fancy breakfast place -PRON- look for reason to even be there instead of ihop denny 's etc because a -PRON- usually more expensive and b -PRON- hard to improve on egg over easy and bacon and these place be solid
-PRON- be go to get the breakfast pot pie
but from the description -PRON- seem less like a pie more like a biscuit and gravy dish with a pie crust in place of biscuit
-PRON- be glad -PRON- ask because that be exactly what -PRON- be
so -PRON- get the blt instead
yea -PRON- have a fancy pesto mayo on -PRON- and some kinda soft cheese but other than that -PRON- -PRON- basic blt and regular bacon describe as soft belly bacon
-PRON- be good but not good enough that -PRON- would ever order this again
-PRON- try -PRON- friend 's 3-ingredient omelet sausage cheddar and mushroom and -PRON- be kind of dense and flavorless
the hash brown be good than -PRON- think -PRON- would be as -PRON- be shredded potato in the shape of a cylinder with only the top part crispy and -PRON- usually like these fry part the good
nothing really special about -PRON- besides the shape
really the only thing -PRON- have ever hear people rave about this place be the pancake flight deal so -PRON- will not fully dismiss the place til -PRON- have try a pancake
-PRON- probably will not be clamor to be back anytime soon though
friendliest service vanessa fast beer refills lindsey no nonsense management with complementary piggy back ride all night
jake
-PRON- hear great thing about clever koi from two friend so -PRON- decide to try -PRON- out with -PRON- boyfriend
-PRON- go around 6:30pm on a friday and sit at the bar as -PRON- be tell there be about a 20 min
wait for the table
although -PRON- have to say there be multiple table available
and -PRON- do not believe -PRON- be for reservation as -PRON- be empty the whole time -PRON- be there
anyway -PRON- order the duck steam bun sweet potato dumpling duck chow mein and -PRON- special of the night which be yellowtail over rice with black kale and persimmon
the duck steam bun be really good but pricey
the sweet potato dumpling remind -PRON- of empanada as the shell be fry like a taco kind of way not a fry dumpl kind of way
however -PRON- really enjoy -PRON-
however -PRON- be very disappointed in -PRON- entree
-PRON- be super salty
the fish be salty the kale be salty even the rice be salty
-PRON- try a bite of the duck chow mein and -PRON- be ok not a huge fan of chow mein
anyway
so -PRON- be no judge there
for all that the bill come to about $ 60
super disappointed but at least that be another restaurant -PRON- can check off of -PRON- list
but if -PRON- be look for an asian fusion place -PRON- would check out sumomaya also a little pricey but at least the food 's really good
good hawaiian\/korean style food and good island people
-PRON- think that apart from arthur 's seat this be probably the good place to get a good view of edinburgh
not too difficult to climb -PRON- offer put -PRON- on the castle princes street holyrood park and the firth
-PRON- just wish -PRON- have not leave that mock greek temple unfinished
first timer
-PRON- be go to say after all the hype i think -PRON- be go to be alot good
the fish taco be so dry
-PRON- need to put alot more dress on and less cabbage
-PRON- would go back but deff go to try something new
suuuuuper delicious sooo worth every penny
-PRON- be a splurge and a normal dinner for two will start at $ 300 so if -PRON- be able to fork out that kinda dough on dinner
please do it
-PRON- will not regret -PRON-
the food be off the chart -PRON- dinner be a masterpiece from start to finish with great service
stay away
-PRON- do not care about patient care
the front desk be so rude and nasty the doctor really need to rethink about -PRON- staff and the way -PRON- treat there patient
the patient care be a nightmare stay away
-PRON- agree with mark w. red rocks be the place to be
but in all fairness -PRON- be very pleased with the service and cleanliness of the room
-PRON- would have no problem come back to the suncoast
-PRON- be nice and the bed awesome nice soft sheet that be clean as well
be -PRON- listen luxor
-PRON- be treat like a value guest and -PRON- seem to know about service and about how housekeep works
-PRON- even find the baggage guy polite and with a proper attitude
know the entertainment that be play in the showroom that night
-PRON- be very pleased at how polite the bartender be -PRON- be old and have a personality
-PRON- be also impressed in the restaurant how nice the four of -PRON- be treat as well and good italian food
only one problem in the giftshop the cashier not the manager
-PRON- be wonderful have a problem with -PRON- debit card as -PRON- do not have -PRON- name on -PRON- and do not seem to know english
all that well get frustrated
-PRON- just pay cash for -PRON- stuff kitty
all in all a nice friendly place to stay
seem child friendly and folk that have kid do not let -PRON- run around wild either
-PRON- sleep like a log and weas very pleased at how -PRON- be treat here
-PRON- be welcome and enjoy a relaxing smoke
very friendly to out of towner will visit when ever in town
bad than the bad bad food bad service how dare -PRON- call this korean bbq
no lettuce no korean bbq sauce no quality
the pork be way thick than -PRON- should be
bad experience
will not come back anymore
good food -PRON- be stuff with one burrito but -PRON- not -PRON- everyday place because of -PRON- price
for a decent burrito -PRON- look at around $ 11
not that impressive
decent calzone with soft crust though
cook for the taste of people with advanced age basically
-PRON- do not know about the dealership directly
however -PRON- can say -PRON- transport driver need to be more careful and conscious of the traffic law
-PRON- be travel south bind on i-85 towards north georgia
one of -PRON- transport driver in a black buick rendezvous pass -PRON- in excess of 85 mph plus swerve in and out of traffic
keep in mind this be in saturday afternoon traffic
around 1:00 pm
-PRON- do not know about williams buick\/gmc but when -PRON- sell car for nissan driver be hold to strict standard and tell speed in a dealer vehicle can get -PRON- fire
especially if -PRON- get a ticket
-PRON- just wish -PRON- have get the tag number of the fd tag
but this be difficult with the way the vehicle be move
-PRON- gm should let that driver know these driving habit be unacceptable
have a nice stay
although -PRON- be airport area -PRON- only see one plane and never hear one -PRON- entire two day stay
location be about 10 minute south of downtown even if -PRON- stay off the highway and be near plenty of shop and eat option
there be several hotel in this park like area but esa have the good rate and the add kitchenette be a plus
the room be clean and refurb not too long ago
tv reception be off but a call to the front desk have -PRON- fix the next day
small of gripe no shampoo
now -PRON- be sure -PRON- may be available upon request but -PRON- overnight travel kit be devoid of any tsa snafu such as 3 oz liquid bottle need a see through bag
a nearby walgreens give -PRON- a large variety from which to choose
buy a great truck with everything -PRON- want in a pickup
the price be right and the service reciev from tony and -PRON- wife be exceptional
-PRON- wife and -PRON- appreciate all of -PRON- help
this be the good most flavorful indian food -PRON- have ever have
a ma zing
can not wait to come back for more
as a fan of the beer temple -PRON- happen by this place and decide to give -PRON- a try
-PRON- be a very cool spot and -PRON- like -PRON- variety of unique nc beer
where seaboard focus on international beer -PRON- appear that temple mojo offer unusual flavor beer
-PRON- have the pb jelly beer and -PRON- also have a banana split flavor beer

update 9.18.15
new management be extremely rude unprofessional and lazy
-PRON- think -PRON- name be scott beware
quality 5 star
service 5 star
ability to go here on a regular basis 1 star
-PRON- move to phoenix from l.a. and one of the hard thing for -PRON- to get use to have be the dry cleaner here
who would have think that reusable bag and other green measure be so freakish in phoenix
-PRON- be so excited to find odc and -PRON- groupon
$ 30 to spend on dry cleaning -PRON- think sweet
but -PRON- bill be another $ 90 on top of that
-PRON- may suggest to the owner that -PRON- not offer so many amenity to those of -PRON- who do not use -PRON-
if -PRON- drop -PRON- own clothe off -PRON- should not have to pay for everyone else who use the delivery service
nor do -PRON- particularly need free water at the dry clean plastic bottle hello
and if -PRON- use the reusable bag why be -PRON- also use plastic inside
major prop to the staff for be really professional and nice
love that the place be clean
love that there be hanger recycling box available
love the quality of the cleaning
but just can not do -PRON-
do not ever go here for great pizza the inside of the place be awesome
i want the food to be good too
-PRON- swear little sleazers be good
if -PRON- dump the pizza shit and throw a couple pooltable in there maybe a live band every onece in a while
i wish -PRON- have good pizza i live so close -PRON- want to show -PRON- how to make a pizza i feel bad that some people have say this be whatthey consider good pizza
go there for lunch with -PRON- team
have a salmon salad
the fish be tasty and moist but the spring mix be not that spring but u can not expect much from a sport bar
the beer selection be fantastic and -PRON- have quite a few stout and porter
the beer price be fantastic
the service be great
overall good spot
house in what be formerly be black forest mill black forest haus be open by the same owner as the matterhorn grill in flagstaff chef klaus baechle and -PRON- wife nancy
the space be more or less unchanged with a few art piece add as well as a fresh coat of paint
the massive main hall be complete with a large open dance floor which on friday and saturday night be set up for live traditional german music
-PRON- do not know about -PRON-
but -PRON- be always look for a chance to wear -PRON- lederhosen and whoop -PRON- up to a good polka
the menu be a short list feature many traditional german dish and while most think of german food as only sausage and pretzel -PRON- may be surprise by hearty roasted meat stew and schnitzel
-PRON- have own a fondue pot for year but not once have ever use -PRON-
the idea of eat hot molten cheese sound amazing but for whatev reason -PRON- just have never get around to make -PRON-
so when -PRON- notice swiss cheese fondue $ 15 on the menu -PRON- think of -PRON- orange cast iron pot sit there collect dust
so when a ceramic bowl of what look like seize gravy be deliver -PRON- figure there be something wrong
ask -PRON- server -PRON- reveal that be how -PRON- serve -PRON- maybe -PRON- expectation be high
traditionally make with veal a schnitzel recipe can also be make with boneless pork loin or chicken breast pound into cutlet
now with the addition of a sour cream sauce make -PRON- a rahmschnitzel $ 18 guess -PRON- should have ask for a description before -PRON- order -PRON-
-PRON- see -PRON- have envision a lightly bread and fry schnitzel with creamy gravy
so when -PRON- schnitzel arrive -PRON- be actually pan cook and not fry like -PRON- be hop for
so -PRON- swallow -PRON- bitter pill along with -PRON- first bite fork tender deliciousness
-PRON- only wish be that -PRON- have not be out of mash potato something about put gravy on a baked potato just do not work for -PRON-
haus also have a selection of nightly special which include 2 side at a great price
if -PRON- ever see schweinehaxen $ 19 list on the special board order -PRON-
schweinehaxen be either a roasted pork knuckle or shank that be be cook until the meat be fall of the bone tender and the skin be crispy and chewy
for the serious pig lover the skin be cook so well that -PRON- be like eat a piece of lacquer pork candy
along side -PRON- have little dumpling call spätzle and a wonderfully flavorful stewed red cabbage these both add to the delight of each and every piggy bite
sit here write -PRON- can not help but think of the additively porky schweinehaxen
the richness of the meat be cut by the acidity of the stewed red cabbage -PRON- be not only what be for dinner but -PRON- be what foodie dream be make of
-PRON- would not say the food here be mind blow but this restaurant do offer an amazing view of the bellagio fountain and excellent service
the decor be also beautiful as -PRON- would expect
the food however do not impress -PRON- at all
everything just taste o.k
and -PRON- find -PRON- miss -PRON- cheap go to chinese place back in -PRON- hometown
when -PRON- eat chinese food -PRON- expect the flavor to jump out at -PRON- and to entice -PRON- to eat more and more
with this place -PRON- just feel like everything be unfortunately bland
-PRON- mean -PRON- do not know that -PRON- have have a more boring mapo tofu which be one of -PRON- favorite dish of all time
for the price point -PRON- would definitely suggest go elsewhere
really enjoy the henry
be there 3x
love the interior but will agree -PRON- be a bit loud at time for conversation
the menu be eclectic
-PRON- try the chef 's breakfast special just because -PRON- sound so unusual and seth recommend -PRON- so -PRON- trust and be not disappoint
very good
the kale and apple slaw surprise -PRON- and be -PRON- favorite item right now
and the white truffle and parmesan fry well just order and thank -PRON- later
-PRON- always ask to be seat in seth 's section
-PRON- be the school teacher by day\/server on nights\/weekend
-PRON- great people skill allow -PRON- to give amazing attention without hover good suggestion fun personality
-PRON- definitely complete the dining experience
-PRON- be the good
this will become a regular spot for -PRON-
-PRON- walk in -PRON- be ok not to busy not dead
-PRON- sit down and -PRON- place -PRON- order
-PRON- take 25 min to get app -PRON- order crab cake but there be barely any crab
than another 20 min for main and those be ok
-PRON- friend order baja fish tacos- the fish be to big for the taco -PRON- decide on the chimichanga and -PRON- be fill with more rice
base on service this place be disappointing
there be 8 employee
so -PRON- be not sure what happen
good be just ok nothing special to rave about
no chance of -PRON- come back
if -PRON- ask -PRON- for a list of -PRON- favorite restaurant in charlotte aria would definitely crack the top 10
-PRON- have be here 3 or 4 time and be extremely happy with the food service atmosphere and consistency
-PRON- favorite dish be the caprese salad butternut squash ravioli and penne a la vodka
-PRON- wine list be spectacular and although -PRON- be not a wine aficionado by any mean -PRON- really love the $ 6.50 glass of chianti -PRON- offer
-PRON- boyfriend get the bourbon smash cocktail and say -PRON- be one of the good cocktail -PRON- be have
-PRON- have not be there for -PRON- happy hour but -PRON- do have $ 5 bar bite available on weekday
a lot of -PRON- friend say -PRON- go there after work and have nothing bad to say
-PRON- also would say this be a good place to go for after dinner drink or dessert and a coffee
lastly if -PRON- be go here on a date try to get one of the seat in the corner-
-PRON- be a good way to sit close to -PRON- date without be awkward and sit on the same side of the table
the drunken chicken be excellent
the crawfish etouffee be great as well but very very heavy on the stomach and very rich
-PRON- love -PRON- so much that -PRON- eat -PRON- twice in a row and now -PRON- can not eat the etouffee anymore
but everything else be delicious so -PRON- will get over -PRON-
and if -PRON- like crawfish -PRON- should definitely give -PRON- a try
-PRON- love messini
there be a reason there be always long line out the door during meal time and later in the evening
-PRON- tend to go for lunch in the mid afternoon or just before dinner time to avoid the line
-PRON- would not necessarily recommend -PRON- other platter\/meal dish there be plenty of other good restaurant nearby for that
but do not miss the gyro
-PRON- be superb fresh delicious and among the cheap on the danforth
the meat be the real deal
during taste of the danforth -PRON- be look at various roasting pit the restaurant put out and see that at some place the meat just look like a block of completely smooth plastic fake thing
at messini -PRON- be literally large hunk of meat stack on top of each other and -PRON- can taste the difference
if -PRON- be in need of a quick affordable tasty meal to meet friend over or take home to enjoy alone this be a great option
das steak war wirklich gut
und wenn man eine vorgegebene kombination wählt ist es auch nicht zu teuer
nimmt man jedoch alle komponenten einzeln wird der preis entsprechend hoch
und das ambiente inklusive bedienung war
okay aber nicht überwältigend
alle in allem kann man mal hingehen ist aber kein muß
jenna be a really creepy person
-PRON- ring up -PRON- friend and -PRON- when -PRON- be in the store and -PRON- would give this creepy blank stare from the back area not to mention how long -PRON- take to get -PRON- drink
why do two youthberry tea take 10 minute to be ready
in -PRON- opinion food be ok
nothing to spectacular
raman decent but not too flavorful
price be decent
there be a combo a raman and sushi roll for $ 10
-PRON- also get a free ice cone with yelp
do not know if -PRON- will return since there be hardly no one for lunch
-PRON- may be the location as -PRON- be with several message spa
to each -PRON- own
this place be so great
-PRON- first time eat curry goat and oxtail
and -PRON- be hooked
very generous portion
the collard green be the good -PRON- have ever have
great food
staff be extremely nice
-PRON- love the atmosphere and the variety of pancake that -PRON- have on the menu
-PRON- love browse around in this store
the item be from the east which add a great variety to madison
the jewelry and the small item around the jewelry be generally reasonable but the rest of the item be be little bit overpriced
however come from a small town the uniqueness of the store be compelling
and -PRON- smell nice
dennis be a huge help with a photo book project that almost have -PRON- in tear from previous fail attempt at walmart and cvs
-PRON- set -PRON- up on a kiosk that be actually work properly check on -PRON- regularly and even add a coupon discount
now -PRON- grandma 's 90th birthday photo book be underway
thank -PRON- dennis for -PRON- great customer service
-PRON- have never be to australia but the fare serve here remind -PRON- a lot of the type of food -PRON- have enjoy during -PRON- visit to england over the year
whether -PRON- be crave a mincemeat pie steak and kidney pie steak and mushroom pie sausage roll scone or other assorted pastry this be a great place to grab a quick bite to eat
-PRON- only complaint be that everything be a la carte and put together a meal get a bit pricey
-PRON- wish -PRON- would offer some combo meal that include meat pie side dish and a drink
-PRON- do have some combo if -PRON- be order a large amount of food for a party or group event but nothing for individual
there be also not much atmosphere to the place as -PRON- a large open space with a cafeteria feel
overall though -PRON- be a good place to eat
-PRON- be book at this hotel for a conference
-PRON- start with arrival a full day and a half prior to the conference and upon check in tell that per -PRON- request -PRON- smoking room be ready
there be not a chance in hell that -PRON- reserve a smoking room.we be tell that the hotel be sell out for the conference and there be nothing to be do -PRON- be well ahead of the conference crowd
really
couldn't someone check in later bear the brunt of this issue
-PRON- refuse the smoking room so ultimately -PRON- be give a room on the third floor
view vent and roof which clearly be not often use
the dust on the furniture be thick the room smell musty and the bad part be that although -PRON- be a non smoking floor people be smoke and -PRON- be come in through the air duct and vent
when -PRON- complain -PRON- be tell there be nothing to be do
feel like a tired big city hotel in a good locale
arizona fry guy be awesome
the mac n cheese be to die for
-PRON- have the fry tilipia dinner with green mac n cheese and peach cobbler

three of -PRON- din here on 5 6 2014 restaurant not busy
-PRON- order cashew chicken mushroom and asparagus bok choy cucumber salad and oolong tea

food delicious and season nicely
server excellent only reason for less than five star be bus service clear all utensil before -PRON- finish the meal and keep take plate before -PRON- be do
-PRON- be from chicago so -PRON- be accustom to high dining price but wow vegas take the extreme pricing to a whole other level
100.00 high but food delicious
waiter do warn -PRON- three time that -PRON- jasmine green tea be 25.00 glass
-PRON- skip -PRON-
but -PRON- be curious what a 25.00 cup of tea taste like
virgin america basically take -PRON- favorite tiesto concert and turn -PRON- into an airline -PRON- would give this airline 5 star for the purple cabin light alone okay maybe not
but -PRON- do really like purple
but in all seriousness virgin just get it and put the rest of the airline to shame
-PRON- have never travel in economy class and feel so special before
from -PRON- top notch service to the comfortable black leather seat to the personal tv monitor with free cable this be as god as -PRON- get by far
-PRON- wish -PRON- would just increase the route -PRON- fly so -PRON- could use -PRON- more often
either way absolutely love this airline
hear about this infamous burger joint first from one of -PRON- co worker then as -PRON- scop out the scene here on yelp -PRON- totally make -PRON- become even more interested in visit this place finally during one of -PRON- recent trip back to the city of sin -PRON- be able to make -PRON- way out there to confirm the verdict and guess what
-PRON- be definitely a thumb up
so what be bachi burger
-PRON- be a similar concept to umami burger that be base in las vegas
let -PRON- jump right into the pros and cons
-PRON- new way of review
pro --great burger
have the kiki burger and -PRON- be off the hook
the size be as big as expect from a gourmet burger joint so nothing special
-PRON- come a la carte so -PRON- fry will always be an extra order on the side
--great truffle parm fry
terrific flavor and definitely deserve a recognition
totally want to try the oxtail chili fry but do not get the chance
the neighboring table order one and -PRON- literally kill -PRON- in about 3 second
can not wait to order this entree next time
-PRON- be visit lv
con
--location be not too hard to find
but -PRON- be not obvious either
ample parking though
--price be definitely on the high side
oxtail chili fry will be around $ 11 buck so be prepared to pay for the food for -PRON- one burger truffle fry and ice tea run around $ 20
so -PRON- be definitely a treat more than anything
--not on the strip where -PRON- be usually at
but -PRON- guess that be ok less crazy crowd -PRON- suppose
verdict
-PRON- will definitely go back
in fact -PRON- next trip -PRON- be go to verify how delicious that oxtail chili fries really be and get to try the miyagi burger too
so stay tune for an updated review come soon
super tasty food not pricy very fast service
-PRON- have really good mac n cheese
and -PRON- love -PRON- carne asada
-PRON- wish -PRON- have read the review about bad customer service at this place before -PRON- decide to go there
that be why -PRON- can not just trust instagram post
the waitress who seem to be the manager be really rude and bitchy
-PRON- make a reservation at 11:30am and -PRON- get there at 11:42am
-PRON- tell -PRON- that -PRON- would only hold a table for 10 min past reservation time and since -PRON- get there 2 minute after that -PRON- have already give -PRON- table to someone else
-PRON- do not want to argue with -PRON-
so -PRON- just ask -PRON- how long -PRON- have to wait for another table
-PRON- seem really annoyed and say -PRON- would go find out
-PRON- look around and see at least 5 unoccupied table
-PRON- return in a few minute and tell -PRON- that -PRON- have to wait for at least 20 minute
-PRON- be really pissed off by -PRON- attitude so -PRON- leave and go to another restaurant near by
seriously -PRON- act as if -PRON- owe -PRON- money or something
will never return in a million year
definitely one of the good mexican restaurant
great service and the food be well cook and present
nice atmosphere and friendly service
-PRON- have be order food from main moon in stow for several year and have eat in a few time
there be numerous menu option and the typical wait time for pick up an order be 10 minute
-PRON- have have a few dish from -PRON- that -PRON- like and -PRON- current favorite be kung pao chicken
the staff have always be personable
the only reason -PRON- take off a star be because -PRON- be not gourmet chinese food but definitely worth the price -PRON- pay
a typical meal -PRON- order there last -PRON- 2 meal because -PRON- be give a large quantity of food
-PRON- get the pizza because everyone tell -PRON- to

-PRON- choose dan over 4 other landscaper and find -PRON- to be honest dependable and someone who stand by what -PRON- promise

-PRON- not only incorporate -PRON- vision but add special touch that just enhance -PRON- backyard
-PRON- have not see this level of competence work ethic and overall professionalism in many year and dan bring all of that to -PRON- project
-PRON- could not be happy with -PRON- fair price and workmanship
lucy chris b

while chat with candice -PRON- mention -PRON- lip dilemma

moral of the story this place have -PRON- all
amazing people who be actually good at -PRON- job who have wonderful personality and who be honest and genuinely want to help -PRON-
good part be this place be a 2 mile drive from -PRON- house
mean to be
a nondescript hole in the wall in a strip of lorain full of auto repair shop tattoo parlor and burner cell phone vendor this be quite possibly -PRON- favorite restaurant in cleveland and certainly -PRON- favorite takeout
the food be objectively awesome and totally addictive
price be reasonable and the portion be extremely generous so plan to have leftover and to be horrify by how heavy -PRON- order be if -PRON- be indecisive
the lot accommodate 2 car
and -PRON- be not sure -PRON- be even intend as such but -PRON- can usually find street parking nearby
-PRON- be cash only so come prepared
have not have cambodian prior to eat here--
the food be like a 70
thai 30 vietnamese mashup with a balance of salty savory sweet cooked and fresh
much more flavorful and a little bit funkier but frankly also less photogenic than either of those cuisine
the noodle dish be -PRON- strong suit and comprise the majority of the menu-- an overwhelming list of similar sounding iteration on a theme that superficially resemble pad thai but have surprisingly distinct flavor profile
a quick rundown of some highlight the creamy shrimp roll be a guilty pleasure-- like cigar shape shrimp crab rangoon in spring roll wrapper the fresh spring roll d\/d1 be especially good and herb heavy mee krolaa 28 be not stir fry so the noodle be a bit more al dente-- toss w a sweet soy base sauce lot of pickle vegetable ground peanut and dry shrimp that lend a salty funk chha bun kari kroup muk 39
stir fry vermicelli with a curry base sauce and every meat know to mankind
the chicken patty be super lemongrassy and totally addictive and the thick rectangle of homemade tofu be fry to a perfect chew
khmer chili
kuy tiev chha 66
essentially a well execute version of americanized tomato paste base pad thai
kuy tiev chha
tek trey phèm 67 73
look like pad thai but stir fry in a sweet soy base sauce
probably the least flavorful of the bunch
kuy tiev chha chou èm 74 80 soy base sauce but more balanced with some tang plentiful chiffonade of herb on top
banh sougnh 108a-113
similar to bun with the usual vegetable topping slice spring roll and fish sauce to pour over but make with thick round rice noodle
top with stir fry meat and onion in a coconuty sauce
weird but delightfully addictive
a few caveat the banh sougnh noodle be rarely cook perfectly-- usually a bit too soft or too firm the basil fry rice be forgettable mee chha a bit weird and chicken lemon grass be a bit bland
the spice rating mean business-- the hue beef soup have so much chili that -PRON- turn the noodle a sort of pepto bismol pink and taste like lava
this be a very nice place to see the whole city of toronto
-PRON- have great view refreshment gift shop and even a restaurant
-PRON- purchase the more expensive ticket and head up to the upper portion of the tower which if -PRON- remember right -PRON- be over 1,400 foot high
the place even have glass floor which -PRON- can walk jump lie on and more -PRON- guess
-PRON- be a neat place
a modern marvel and if -PRON- need help find -PRON- just look up
-PRON- be hard to miss
as a loyal customer -PRON- enjoy this restaurant multiple time a week despite -PRON- mistake on almost every order
over time those mistake become less subtle and more annoying until the oven mess up -PRON- entire take out order
when -PRON- call and speak to the manager who also happen to be in the owner family -PRON- do not say -PRON- name
-PRON- response be just a simple
-PRON- be sorry
after the call end -PRON- find more mistake in -PRON- order after check -PRON- over thoroughly
-PRON- decide to call back and be give another pathetic apology and a refund
at no point do the manager take ownership of the issue and address -PRON- -PRON- simply give a half hearted apology which -PRON- think be good enough
-PRON- do not know about -PRON- but poor customer service like that ruin a restaurant for -PRON-
-PRON- choose where -PRON- eat base on the quality of the food and how good the service be
while -PRON- food may have be good when prepare correctly the service be not
there be too many high school aged child work there who do not understand how to be polite and take an order which only add to the issue here
-PRON- be rather disappointed mainly because this be one of -PRON- favorite casual place to get a bite and now -PRON- be black list for the above reason among other -PRON- have experience
-PRON- would stay away from here if -PRON- value get what -PRON- order and not deal with rude owner
i usually go to -PRON- yonge street location which be excellent although -PRON- have never be offer the rib at yonge
-PRON- go on new year eve for an early dinner with an old friend
-PRON- be busy but -PRON- still find a table for -PRON- and a friend
-PRON- order the usual 6 of everything
-PRON- still wish there be more rice in an order since everything -PRON- order be a stack of meat
-PRON- do not give -PRON- alot of starch or carb to process the meat
however the meat be great and i still love the concept of cookin -PRON- own food at -PRON- table even if -PRON- be small slice of meat that even the most illiterate foodie could cook
one thing i wish that all the korean grill house have be big water glass
now that -PRON- be think about -PRON- -PRON- actually very frustrating
if -PRON- be go to chop meat into small slice and cure -PRON- with salt to keep -PRON- fresh anybody with half a brain know that when u cut a piece of meat into thin slice like korean grill house do -PRON- dry out quicker and add salt to -PRON- make -PRON- last longer so -PRON- can sell -PRON- to the mass before -PRON- expire
-PRON- can at least let -PRON- have large water glass to stay hydrated instead of make the poor kid work the floor fill up -PRON- water glass every 30 second
-PRON- actually feel bad about how many water refill i need and judge from the variety of servers\/busser fill -PRON- i doubt -PRON- 10 $ tip would net any of -PRON- one dollar
other than that though -PRON- be a good time as always
always welcome always fresh always delicious
a fail safe go to taco spot
-PRON- have get -PRON- all in term of -PRON- selection of protein
while -PRON- do not eat pork -PRON- can vouch -PRON- chicken and barbacoa be on point
-PRON- love that -PRON- offer korean kalbi but -PRON- be a little too sweet like beef jerky sweet for -PRON- liking
but other may dig -PRON-
this place be great
always friendly -PRON- have no problem if -PRON- ask for something on the creative side and never a long wait for walk in
awesome
that may even be an understatement
this place create enchilada that be a flavor explosion in -PRON- mouth
there be so many different flavor and combination but no matter which way -PRON- build -PRON- enchilada -PRON- be go to be a success
-PRON- hate to do this because -PRON- be sure -PRON- hear -PRON- all the time but -PRON- be very similar to chipotle in the way -PRON- order and build -PRON- food
-PRON- walk up and go through a process which be nicely explain on -PRON- menu above the ordering area
the people behind the counter be very friendly and will help -PRON- along the way if -PRON- get lose on -PRON- first time through
-PRON- will share -PRON- combination because -PRON- be incredible and give an idea of how the whole thing work
-PRON- get two enchilada in flour tortilla -PRON- have both corn and flour tortilla make in house
in one enchilada -PRON- get the green chile pork and in the other -PRON- get the sweet and spicy cornbread
next -PRON- choose the green sauce and asadero cheese aka jack cheese
then -PRON- throw -PRON- into an open oven and let the cheese melt and bubble over the top
next -PRON- top -PRON- with uncle rico 's pico crumble cojita cheese more cheese honey v slaw so good pickle onion and scratch make crema
lastly -PRON- get the jalapeno ranch on the side which -PRON- be glad -PRON- do because -PRON- have a nice kick to -PRON-
-PRON- go with 4 people and -PRON- total come out to about $ 32
what a steal
-PRON- just get water and skip on the chip and guac
but -PRON- still leave the restaurant feeling full and happily satisfied
-PRON- hope -PRON- open up more location closer to home because -PRON- would eat here all the time
clean room easy check in even late at night
decent basic breakfast
bed be unfortunately very uncomfortable
decent water pressure in the shower
-PRON- do have hide fee -PRON- do not tell u about till after
if -PRON- stay here be sure to upgrade or book the tower room
-PRON- have hear the pyramid room be not as good
-PRON- have a great time here fast check in and a hassle free checkout
look forward to come back soon
this be probably one of the good dry cleaner -PRON- have be to in a very long time
-PRON- help that -PRON- be very close to -PRON- home and have really good hour
-PRON- do all of -PRON- work on site
somehow -PRON- be an organic dry clean shop
-PRON- be always very friendly and helpful and accommodate and -PRON- think -PRON- price be very reasonable
-PRON- also have be able to rush order for -PRON-
-PRON- have even have some alteration do here and -PRON- do a very nice job
-PRON- be a loyal customer for a very good reason and -PRON- should be too
-PRON- enjoy boba less milk tea from time to time and this establishment be open late and have a convenient location on spring mountain
that be fairly close to -PRON- workplace
the inside be gleam very modern esque with table and booth on the floor tea and set availble
tea station be actually a chain with this be the only one in vegas
onto the tea
so -PRON- like the milk tea a lot
-PRON- be not super sweet
but -PRON- be rich tasteful
and -PRON- enjoy -PRON- without the actual boba in -PRON-
the syrup tea be all very sugary and sweet so if -PRON- be -PRON- first time -PRON- recommend an almond tea with a few boba
so -PRON- can try -PRON-
-PRON- would try around at different tea house on spring mountain because one or two of -PRON- actually make -PRON- with fresh ingredient and not artificial syrup
-PRON- also have tea flavor snack and hot treat such as the soup and takoyaki woooo takoyaki
beware takoyaki be hot in the center even if the exterior seem cool
the fry tofu be also nom nom nom but remember this place be mean for snack and comfort food
go get a meal elsewhere but have a quick bite here be more appropriate
-PRON- can take -PRON- boba tea to go for a discount price as well
-PRON- do not find the night crew to be anywhere near on par with the day crew
the day staff be pleasant talkative and cheerful
the night crew will rather forcefully shoo -PRON- out close to close time and be very short and sometimes difficult to talk to
-PRON- roommate can not stand the staff to the point that -PRON- will not go in past five
superbly make dish with an ever expand menu
-PRON- have be there with -PRON- family and work colleague on numerous occasion and -PRON- have never disappoint
-PRON- recently receive a mailer for a complimentary 7 day pass
-PRON- submit -PRON- request online and get a phone call this morning invite -PRON- in to pick up -PRON- pass
on arrival -PRON- be tell that -PRON- would only be able to receive -PRON- pass if -PRON- be interested in purchase the $ 20 or $ 30 plan
the mailer clearly offer the promotional price and mention nothing about have to commit a specific type of membership for the complimentary pass
-PRON- even ask to just try the gym for 1 day not even 7 and the gm tell the sale rep that -PRON- would need to pay $ 15 to use the facility for the day
-PRON- be look to switch gym be a member at 24 fitness for 3 + year and -PRON- just want to view the facility
so -PRON- be extremely disappointed with the poor customer service
the gm could definitely learn more sale skill since -PRON- could have easily sign up for one of the premium membership
-PRON- be not even offer a tour
very deceptive marketing and sale tactic
-PRON- do not even bother to come out of the office real professional
great place to get help for any pain issue
-PRON- have bulge disc and sciatica
-PRON- be bed ride for 6 week and -PRON- get -PRON- the ability to move again with no pain
-PRON- have great thing to help between visit from stretch to ice pack and band
the pillow really help
-PRON- have have acupuncture chiropractic and medical massage
very helpful when combine and manage
the doctor stay connected and share note so -PRON- be easy to work with -PRON-
awesome group
-PRON- also provide text reminder for appointment and between visit reminder
this be absolutely the first positive experience -PRON- have have purchase a new vehicle
oliver be very positive professional to work with and -PRON- know -PRON- product
roger work hard to get -PRON- into the vehicle -PRON- want at a reasonable price
-PRON- just purchase -PRON- new 4runner last month but thus far -PRON- be thrill with the vehicle and with -PRON- buying experience
-PRON- would recommend this dealership and highly recommend the sale team of oliver cree and roger chavira
pink 's be okay
-PRON- like that -PRON- have the option to sub a turkey or veggie dog
-PRON- do not however enjoy the chewy case on the hot dog
-PRON- be hard to bite through and kinda
rubbery
overall -PRON- eat here sometimes because -PRON- be usually pretty quick and easy
-PRON- would not necessarily go out of -PRON- way though
people -PRON- have finally find a hummus fule worth go so far north for
over and over and over
-PRON- have order chicken shawarma take out massive sandwich in a laffa but never actually be to the restaurant
-PRON- finally make -PRON- up here with the sibling to take old dad for dinner this past weekend
-PRON- be definitely off the beaten path as other have already mention and by path
-PRON- mean dufferin south of steeles ave and be pack
the line be huge
the decor be perfect for this place and the mix of people and language make -PRON- a loud lively and in -PRON- opinion perfect experience
the staff and clientele yell at each other in hebrew
english a bit of french and arabic perfect
luckily the line thin out quickly and -PRON- be seat after only a few minute of wait
-PRON- bring fresh out of the stone oven laffa bread to -PRON- table with pickle corn and cabbage salad and some slaw
-PRON- order hummus fule pronounce fool and israeli salad for appetizer along with everything
now if -PRON- do not know what this hummus be -PRON- come with hot semi mash fava bean and a roasted egg on top
then -PRON- take the lemon wedge and drizzle -PRON- over
-PRON- favourite thing to do be rip off some laffa spread on the hummus and bean get a piece of the egg top -PRON- with a pickle and take a bite
unfortunately -PRON- be out of shawarma but -PRON- order the shnitzel -PRON- come with two massive piece one of which -PRON- take for lunch the next day roasted salmon skewer and roasted chicken breast on charcoal
the french fry be thick and freshly make
-PRON- be so stuff
-PRON- be grateful that -PRON- be not wear tight pant
to end -PRON- off -PRON- must have some warm baklawa and mint tea
the perfect finale to a delicious meal
another small ass
forever 21 last time -PRON- come here look for black short and none even exist
but the year before when -PRON- be here -PRON- find a cute black dress so -PRON- can not completely hate on -PRON-
as a vegan for over 10 year i hate to not support a tried and true vegan restaurant in phoenix
but i have to be honest and say that this place do not live up to -PRON- expectation
in fact -PRON- fall quite short
-PRON- eat at the glendale loving hut location and have a far good experience there so -PRON- review here be only for the phoenix location
by all mean do go to the glendale one
-PRON- have a different menu and completely different atmosphere
the phoenix location on indian school road have a very drab interior and very outdated
white metal chair that look like -PRON- be from the 80
-PRON- first impression walk in be not a good one and that be important to -PRON-
definitely not a soothe relaxing atmosphere by any mean
also there be a bad odor in the air
almost smell fishy to -PRON-
-PRON- almost make -PRON- lose -PRON- appetite to be perfectly honest
ok now on to the food
-PRON- get the grilled teryaki dish
by the way do i mention price be also high at this location
$ 9.00 be the cost of this dish for lunch
price be a couple dollar less at the glendale spot
anyways the faux meat in this dish be fine nothing to write home about but -PRON- be good
however -PRON- complaint be that be all -PRON- be
just a big pile of fake meat and a small portion of lukewarm steamed vegetable on the side with no sauce or marinade on -PRON-
just plain vegetable and -PRON- be get cold by the minute
not really what i have in mind for lunch and certainly not worth the $ 9.00 plus the tip
-PRON- guess i should have get the rice to go with -PRON- all but that be extra money
the complimentary lentil soup be a nice touch but -PRON- have have good lentil soup that -PRON- have make -PRON-
the soup too be only lukewarm and very small cup size portion
the only positive i can say be that the waitress be wonderful and very friendly
-PRON- feel bad write a bad review but honesty be -PRON- policy
ok stop here twice
once for lunch once for breakfast
lunch on saturday
the sign all over the casino advertise an $ 8.99 buffet
so -PRON- walk up and figure -PRON- would try -PRON-
first problem
-PRON- be only $ 8.99 if -PRON- be a member of the connect players club the free in house gambling loyalty program
if -PRON- want the $ 8.99 price -PRON- would have to wander off somewhere else in the casino over to member service or something and sign up for the free loyalty program
-PRON- be not about to go figure that out -PRON- be stay here on a rock climbing trip not a gambling trip
so -PRON- pay full price which be almost $ 15
for the price the buffet be not that great
decent amount of choice for lunch type food
but -PRON- be basically just the same as old country buffet
this be not one of those fabled amazing cheap amazing taste vegas buffet of mystery and legend
on the other hand everything be rotate in and out quickly so -PRON- be always fresh
everything -PRON- try pizza turkey mashed potatoes veggies baked chicken be all pretty good
the soda and drink be not self serve but the waitress be very quick and friendly and keep -PRON- top up
overall for lunch -PRON- would have give three star
now on sunday -PRON- be subtract a star
again there be sign all over for a breakfast buffet
$ 8.99
this time -PRON- notice the asterisk
-PRON- figure that be the loyalty card price
three of -PRON- go downstairs anyway expect to pay a little more than that since -PRON- do not have the card but not much more
-PRON- mean -PRON- be breakfast after all
so -PRON- get down there and be inform that because -PRON- be sunday there be no breakfast buffet
-PRON- be champions brunch and -PRON- be $ 24.99
yike
no way
base on the food -PRON- already try there be not anything at all that could be good enough to be worth that
-PRON- go to subway instead and be perfectly happy with breakfast sandwich
the gym be fine
god help -PRON- if -PRON- have a problem with -PRON- billing
the hoop -PRON- will make -PRON- jump through will leave -PRON- breathless and do not plan on ever cancel -PRON- membership
-PRON- family and -PRON- love this hotel because -PRON- be very kid friendly
if -PRON- think that this place be like the wynn hotel -PRON- be wrong
-PRON- do not understand how people can complain about the price if -PRON- think -PRON- be like a high end hotel
why not pay a lot more and stay somewhere else and stop cry about this hotel
just remember one thing and -PRON- will not be mad -PRON- get what -PRON- pay for
again this place be very budget friendly

this place be a little weird
the building -PRON- be nice but the table and chair look cheap
-PRON- also feel like -PRON- be din in a hallway with a dirty floor
the server be extremely nice but the food take forever and -PRON- be not even busy

a little advice for people who ask server and bartender for a surprise cocktail tell -PRON- what -PRON- like and absolutely can not have in -PRON- drink
all -PRON- ask for be a cocktail that be not overly sweet a little bit weird and off the wall and absolutely no egg white because -PRON- do eat a vegetarian diet

-PRON- can not wait to come back and try some more dish and cocktail with such pleasant service
-PRON- do not have the lunch special on the menu or tell -PRON- about -PRON- if -PRON- do not ask so make sure to ask
the sandwich do not come with fry and -PRON- fry be over price for not be very good
the pull pork sandwich be good and so be the sauce
also expect a long wait especially if people be ahead of -PRON-
pretty good yogurt
though -PRON- be the people work that usually make -PRON- day
-PRON- be locate right downstairs from where -PRON- work
-PRON- be not sure if -PRON- be the business owner or what
but -PRON- see -PRON- a lot often with a huge grin and promise of tasty treat
-PRON- be super nice and will somehow start up a 5 min conversation even before -PRON- make -PRON- down to the yogurt bar
with a very nice sidewalk seating area this be a perfect place as an afternoon snack or dessert since the sun set on the opposite side of the building give incredible shade
the only reason -PRON- give 4 star not enough fruit
craftsteak be amazing
definitely worth the money and worth all five star
-PRON- be a bachelorette party of 4 lady who be on a time crunch as -PRON- have ticket to see boyz ii men at the mirage at 7:30
one of the great thing about this restaurant be that -PRON- can make a reservation via yelp\/open table or on -PRON- website
and -PRON- time be 5:45 -PRON- believe
for appetizer -PRON- try the diver sea scallops
-PRON- love these
-PRON- be so flavorful and perfectly season
so perfectly cook as well
honestly out of the world and certainly the good scallop -PRON- have ever have
-PRON- be definitely a dish -PRON- must have and try whilst here
-PRON- also have the organic lettuce with lemon vinaigrette
good salad but very large piece
-PRON- do not care too much for the lemon but that be on -PRON- and not on the restaurant
-PRON- split the free range chicken au jus with -PRON- girl friend and that be moist and tender
season very well
-PRON- have french fry and the brentwood sweet corn as side
french fry be -PRON- typical french fry nothing extremely special but still delicious
that corn however also amazing
never think to saute corn and green onion together but -PRON- be innovative to -PRON- haha
the seasoning -PRON- use be on point though
very immaculate service from the chef and staff
-PRON- would go back again and again if -PRON- live in vegas
-PRON- be in a rush for -PRON- show so -PRON- poor waiter be rush by -PRON-
-PRON- tip -PRON- generously though and hop -PRON- do not think -PRON- hat -PRON- service -PRON- be excellent
-PRON- even bring -PRON- dessert and congratulate -PRON- bride friend
margarita be awesome
-PRON- order the crispy shrimp street taco platter and at first glance -PRON- be not what -PRON- expect however -PRON- turn out great
-PRON- will definitely be return and recommend to -PRON- friend
can not say anything good about the ethic of this company after use -PRON- for an annual ac service that -PRON- win in the p.o.r.a. vendors fair event in sun city west several month back
technician say -PRON- need some major work on -PRON- ac unit duct clean
get a second opinion the second company technician look at -PRON- after say all be fine and -PRON- say but another company recomend this and that
so let say -PRON- lose faith in ron brocks
-PRON- have the brisket sandwich with baked bean
the brisket be moist and full of flavor
the combination of slaw and bbq sauce be spot on
the bun be a little on the stale side

-PRON- be 8:11 and no sign of opening on time
bit of a pet peeve of mine
1st time here not a great first impression
ehhhh
-PRON- be a trade off
do -PRON- want to be on campus town or do -PRON- want to be dt
mostly people come to champaign because -PRON- be do something with the university
to be honest all the hotel be mediocre at good here
this place have proximity to campus
so -PRON- be a winner in a lot of way
what be terrible be the fact that the bed be terrible
-PRON- have muscle spasm in -PRON- shoulder from this bed
-PRON- do not actually clean the room regularly
-PRON- come back at 3 pm one time and -PRON- be completely uncleaned
the parking garage be terrible because -PRON- hotel key card never work
breakfast food be terrible but -PRON- be also bad at the hyatt
-PRON- be mostly always over per diem for gsa
the after hour food be also terrible -PRON- could have get a good choice of soup than chicken chowder
and of course there be no bar there be a ton of bar in walk distance
-PRON- prefer hyatt and dt a lot more
but -PRON- be nice to be able to walk to almost every meeting -PRON- need to go to
-PRON- have a delivery for a couple of large pizza 's and wing
-PRON- be fresh hot and good
the driver be on time
-PRON- will order again
-PRON- be thoroughly impressed with this facility

-PRON- be contact by a member of otf after fill out an online request for a free class
initially when the first staff member contact -PRON- -PRON- be super sick with bronchitis
-PRON- love that once -PRON- be tell this -PRON- back off some and ask if -PRON- could call -PRON- that weekend after -PRON- be feel good to schedule -PRON- free class for the following week
-PRON- agree and -PRON- do exactly as promise

next the day before -PRON- workout -PRON- receive another call remind -PRON- to come a half hour early and what to bring towel and water which -PRON- will need both by the way
when -PRON- get there the next morning -PRON- be greet by cherie who by the way be amazing
-PRON- be super friendly and explain every possible detail about otf and the method behind the madness
-PRON- also hook -PRON- up with the heart rate monitor and tell -PRON- how the process work
-PRON- ask -PRON- about -PRON- current fitness routine and really just chat and make -PRON- feel more comfortable
-PRON- introduce -PRON- to the instructor halle before class
halle then take -PRON- into the room by -PRON- which -PRON- love and explain the workout of head of -PRON- for the day and how to interpret what -PRON- would be see on the screen
-PRON- really put -PRON- at ease yet give -PRON- the quick and dirty about what to expect
-PRON- explanation be not length rather succinct and accurate
love that
after -PRON- give -PRON- the tour -PRON- let other member of the class in and class start
-PRON- love the music in the class
-PRON- be on point
-PRON- be a big proponent of music that make -PRON- want to bust -PRON- butt and this class totally do -PRON- for -PRON-
-PRON- sweat like crazy which -PRON- love and feel like -PRON- wok all of -PRON- body
-PRON- love -PRON- so much that -PRON- come back the next day 5 be actually for more
again -PRON- be greet by cherie and this time -PRON- have class with rose
-PRON- too provide high energy excellent demo and just a real positive upbeat vibe to class just like halle do
the staff at otf be super friendly
everyone be smile and seem really into -PRON- job which -PRON- love
-PRON- be new to charlotte and -PRON- have be look for a place to workout for a month now
-PRON- think -PRON- find -PRON-
-PRON- should add that otf be a bit pricey especially to the average person just want a mild workout
however -PRON- feel -PRON- worth every penny
eventually -PRON- hope to upgrade to the unlimited plan but due to the fact that -PRON- be an educator -PRON- be go with 8 session a month for now
-PRON- can sum -PRON- experience up in one word sexy
-PRON- recently have the pleasure of stay here with -PRON- hubby for 1-night and -PRON- fall in love
everything about this hotel be gorgeous
from the moment -PRON- walk in the front door
-PRON- be a fun sophisticated\/sexy energy
the hotel also do not have that overpower cigarette smell that most casino 's have
-PRON- chek in during peak
check in checkout time
so -PRON- be a little bit of a cluster
however the staff do -PRON- absolute good to be pleasant and accommodate
a hostess even serve -PRON- little cosmopolitan bottle of water while -PRON- wait in line all of -PRON- little frustration with the check in process be immediately put to rest when -PRON- arrive to -PRON- room
-PRON- stay in a king terrace studio locate on the 24th fl
wowzer
the room be massive and immaculately clean
-PRON- be actually shock -PRON- how large the room be
-PRON- have a full sized sectional with a plasma tv in the live area
-PRON- would describe the decor as sleek modern and glamorous unlike any other hotel -PRON- have ever stay at in vegas
the balcony be also huge with a view of the pool
unfortunately -PRON- be not on the bellagio fountain side the pool view be still cool
the bed be beyond comfortable and the linen be amazing
since -PRON- be only here for 1-night -PRON- do not have an opportunity to explore the hotel in -PRON- be entirety
-PRON- do swing by chandelier for a late night cocky tail
this be one of the most stunning bar -PRON- have ever see
the humongous chandelier be breathtaking
-PRON- be not crazy impressed by -PRON- drink but -PRON- be kinda more consume with the bar -PRON-
overall -PRON- can not find anything negative to say about this hotel
-PRON- will most definitely be stay here the next time -PRON- be in vegas
ich hoffe das mit den 24h öffnungszeiten hat sich nicht geändert mein letzter besuch
zu nachtschwärmerzeiten ist schon eine
weile -PRON-
aber auch tagsüber macht der gül den besten döner in stuttgart
und zwei spieße sorgen für kurze
wartezeiten
da ein fenster für den straßenverkauf fehlt
sieht es von
außen eher
nach gemütlicher kneipe aus die sitzgelegenheiten sind aber sehr überschaubar

this place be expensive the back deck be incredibly beautiful in the spring\/summer -PRON- be always crowd with a very strange crown and no one there be very friendly
-PRON- first experience there
the food be bad -PRON- waitress be completely rude -PRON- spend the evening ignore -PRON- table of 8 people and could not even get -PRON- drink order earlier than 30 min after -PRON- sit down
-PRON- be over price over hype and completely boring
-PRON- have be back since -PRON- first time multiple time
-PRON- love the pickle vegetable
the taco be be okay but not really -PRON- favorite
-PRON- have ever have
the back patio be pretty much the good thing about this place
-PRON- have a lovely brunch
-PRON- will say again -PRON- be expensive for what -PRON- be and for the longest time -PRON- do not have the price list for pitcher
-PRON- buy 2 pitcher of sangria and -PRON- think out bill be $ 70
-PRON- be alarm to say the least
-PRON- friend tell -PRON- about this place and as luck would have -PRON- -PRON- use to own saporro sushi which -PRON- use to love to go to until -PRON- sell -PRON-
needless to say
-PRON- could not wait to eat here
-PRON- of course have ayce and no kidding everything -PRON- order be delicious
-PRON- favorite roll stacie vampire wet dream japanese lasagna orleans lew
must have
no name hand roll omg soo good
love love love the baked green mussel and tako down several order of the oyster shooter and also the ikura salmon egg be worth mention
-PRON- also order -PRON- usual california roll shrimp tempura edamame etc
waitress be wonderful and the timing of the food be bring to -PRON- table be perfect
most place that -PRON- have be to and -PRON- have be to alot of ayce bring -PRON- roll out all the same time
but here -PRON- bring out 2 3 type of roll out at a time which -PRON- think be good
-PRON- give -PRON- party a chance to really savor the roll in front of -PRON- and just when -PRON- think -PRON- just eat the good roll yet -PRON- waitress would deliver the rest of -PRON- sushi
yummy
-PRON- waitress be very attentive to -PRON- need and make sure to come take more order of sushi from -PRON- when need
the restaurant be small but
-PRON- like that -PRON- give -PRON- more of a warm invite sort of homey feeling
-PRON- have to try this place
the restaurant be clean the fish be fresh tasting so good -PRON- melt in -PRON- mouth good sushi chef and wait staff
-PRON- can not go wrong come here
the only thing -PRON- wish -PRON- know before come here though be that -PRON- do charge -PRON- for -PRON- little kid
-PRON- be half price
so be $ 13 per child for dinner
-PRON- have a 3yr old and an 18 mo
-PRON- do not eat much and eat off -PRON- plate
so -PRON- be a little bummed about that
but the food be great and that make up for -PRON-
so be ready to fork out some cash if -PRON- decide to take -PRON- kid along
if not go to island sushi down the street where -PRON- have go to many time and -PRON- never charge -PRON- for kid and the food there be good too
but in -PRON- opinion -PRON- sushi be not as tasty as sin city sushi
nothing inventive
the crepe be decent but overall kind of plain
-PRON- get butter and brown sugar
the top layer have all of the flavor and the rest be just plain crepe
the walnut and honey crepe be literally like 4 scoop of whole walnut drench in honey
guess there be not anything too exciting in the description that -PRON- should have expect haha $ 8 though
there be however some other interesting item like a bailey 's creme and raspberry one -PRON- wish -PRON- try
perhaps those would be good
maybe will try again if -PRON- be in the area
for $ 150.00 for two night pretty decent and on a busy busy easter weekend gigantic room pretty decent also this be definitely a place that -PRON- should check out because -PRON- in the middle of the major hotel
bathroom be clean bed be clean tube tv haha in comparison to treasure island where -PRON- cousin and friend shove -PRON- into a room that be a lot more pricy and -PRON- can probably fit two of there room into -PRON- hotel room at ballys
that s how big -PRON- room be
drink taste fantastic have a banana batida and a the capirinha music fun and good group of people
great service great price amazing place
the best tasting juice i highly recommend haus of vapor to anyone
good chicken sandwich
little gem in the middle of a strip mall
ton of old school soda to choose from and really really great food
ask for ranch on the side if -PRON- order the chicken sandwich
fry be cook perfectly and the strawberry cream soda be heaven
-PRON- would be a regular at this place if live in phoenix
food service be 4 star
the ambiance location and presentation just about 2 star -PRON- feel like eat in a hotel restaurant breakfast room
no real character but something on the wall and on the bar to remind -PRON- this be an italian
no atmosphere
just nice
-PRON- do a tour last month
-PRON- mean to review -PRON- at the time but totally forget
let -PRON- tell -PRON-
-PRON- take a lot of tour and this one be one of the good
personally when -PRON- want to do a beer tour -PRON- want to have fun
and -PRON- do a great job combine fun and knowledge into the tour
-PRON- know that -PRON- like the beer at the first two stop
and -PRON- be sure that -PRON- like -PRON- at the third stop too
but -PRON- can not remember
-PRON- be have too much fun
-PRON- realize this be locate within a food court but that do not mean the employee get a pass on be able to function properly and\/or successfully do -PRON- job
-PRON- be here this week and after make -PRON- froyo bowl have a host of difficulty purchase -PRON- order
the girl try swipe -PRON- card three or four time without give -PRON- any explanation as a grumble line begin to form
eventually -PRON- be tell that the card keep take a while to process but that -PRON- be not -PRON- machine because -PRON- would do credit sale already that day-
-PRON- keep point at a handful of three or four receipt strip by the cash register
-PRON- assure -PRON- the card have just work 5 minute ago when purchase movie ticket but -PRON- just keep swipe and star at the screen blankly
finally -PRON- pull out cash and go on -PRON- way but do not receive any sort of apology for the inconvenience
usually -PRON- do not even carry cash so -PRON- be not sure how this employee would have handle that situation
before -PRON- could even enjoy -PRON- treat -PRON- be distressed by the card situation
so -PRON- sit down and immediately call -PRON- bank only to find out that -PRON- do not have any record whatsoever of any attempt transaction
by the time -PRON- be assure that -PRON- do not have some sort of financial issue go on -PRON- froyo be a melty puddle
-PRON- be not too bad but would have be better cold and with quality customer service
in regard to the food -PRON- will say that the tart flavor be surprisingly good and do not have a funky aftertaste like other have but the crème brulee flavor be good
-PRON- appreciate that -PRON- have a shaker of crush graham cracker which be a little unusual
in addition to self serve froyo this place also have speciality smoothie and some crepe which look tasty but overprice
wait
-PRON- husband and -PRON- go to grab dinner around 6 p.m. on a saturday night with an hour wait no biggie
-PRON- be place on -PRON- nowait list but oddly enough -PRON- can not add -PRON- to the list from home -PRON- have to check in in person first
drinks decent beer at decent price
kind of odd -PRON- do not have an accessible list of draft
have to walk to the other end of the restaurant to see the draft list
dinner
-PRON- be out of multiple item from the menu
-PRON- order the brisket and -PRON- husband get the rib
-PRON- brisket come out lukewarm and sparse
husband rib be super salty but tasty
the good part be the side mac and cheese and bake bean dessert -PRON- both get glaze donut
-PRON- be not donut
-PRON- be basically a fry and glaze hamburger bun
would not get again
yuck
-PRON- will try -PRON- again but be not floor right out the gate
-PRON- always enjoy panera
great fresh food
yummy soup salad and sandwich
do not forget the great pastry and goody
love the iced tea variety
love this location- great atmosphere
always a good choice
so as a disclaimer -PRON- do not actually stay here
nor do -PRON- game except for a celebratory pull at an oddly confusing slot machine
-PRON- be here for the yelp spring break bar crawl and the promise of $ 2 freeze long islands basically coke slushie but -PRON- know what those be damn good from pretty girl who look unusually happy about -PRON- job lure -PRON- and a few other away from the pack
as soon as -PRON- get -PRON- drink -PRON- be approach by the hotel manager who offer to give -PRON- a tour of the new suite before -PRON- open
this be notable because every other property on the bar crawl have completely ignore -PRON- so -PRON- be quite happy to take -PRON- up on -PRON- offer
on the way -PRON- get to see some interesting artifact from the casino 's history the first telephone in vegas bottle leave in the attic in 1906 from drunk workman and learn that the elevator be use to generate energy on -PRON- way down which be both eco friendly and really neat
the new suite be beautiful and extremely reasonably price and surprisingly quiet consider the location on the bustling corner of fremont
back down in the lobby -PRON- get to enter a drawing for two free night at one of the new suite which one of -PRON- friend win and approach by -PRON- casino floor hospitality manager who chat -PRON- up and give -PRON- -PRON- card but definitely seem like -PRON- enjoy the conversation and be not just try to sell the property
the golden gate seem like a friendly well run casino and if -PRON- ever stay downtown that be where -PRON- will be
this place be so korean and -PRON- refreshingly nice
situate in a relatively quiet plaza this be a no frill korean restaurant
one factor -PRON- always look for at a korean place be the old auntie who -PRON- assume gain experience from cook for -PRON- family
-PRON- wife and -PRON- have -PRON- go to 's kimchi jigae kimchi stew and soon dubu jigae soft tofu stew
the kimchi stew be well cook to the point -PRON- get that tomatoey taste
-PRON- be on the spicy side and quite sour if -PRON- like that
the soon tofu be spicy too and be pack full of soft tofu and seafood
the stew be so fill that -PRON- could not finish -PRON-
fyi a raw egg be put into the stew before serve
each stew come with the usual bowl of purple rice and price at $ 9.95
service be straight forward as the lady be not fluent in english
would definitely come back for authentic and no frill korean food
excellent job in repair -PRON- iphone 6s plus screen
look like nothing ever happen
-PRON- also misplace -PRON- invoice and -PRON- email -PRON- to -PRON- upon request
excellent customer service and job well do
highly recommend -PRON-
the employee make -PRON- order as soon as -PRON- hear -PRON- at the register
this make order go by pretty quick when -PRON- be a pretty small to decent order
otherwise a large order back up the line far too much
most of the employee there look really unhappy and -PRON- have witness arguement and even fight yes literal fist fight between employee
the food be great usual -PRON- be just the staff can really make or break the din experience
very authentic mexican food
love the guacamole
however
the seating here suck hairy monkey ball
there be no where to sit and -PRON- go during slow hour
-PRON- can not imagine how shitty -PRON- must be during peak hour
the bad thing be there be drunk bro take over seat with pile of trash on -PRON- table and -PRON- will not move
-PRON- need row of just elevated table
so -PRON- can just hang out and eat
that be -PRON-
no sit around and take space
get in eat get out
more room and less clutter
the very few table there suck too
everything be too tight and people fight over the chair
-PRON- be so happy to have find this establishment
this steakhouse go above and beyond -PRON- expectation
the service food and decor be outstanding
-PRON- come here on a saturday night to celebrate a birthday and -PRON- truly give -PRON- the royal treatment
-PRON- sit -PRON- by the window overlook the vegas strip have the table decorate with birthday confetti and birthday card give -PRON- complimentary tasting of two drink and provide a generous sample of -PRON- dessert with a birthday candle
the server
dominic be amazing and extremely helpful in help -PRON- decide on -PRON- meal for the evening
-PRON- be a significant contributor to why -PRON- have such a fantastic time
not only be -PRON- helpful with food recommendation but -PRON- also give -PRON- tip on which casino game be statistically more likely to pay out and also ask some of -PRON- colleague for recommendation on where to go to get the most bang for -PRON- buck
-PRON- be sort of new to the whole gambling world and appreciate -PRON- insight
the food be amazing
-PRON- friend whose birthday -PRON- celebrate state that -PRON- bone in fillet be the best steak -PRON- have ever have
-PRON- have the bone in ny strip with gorgonzola and savour -PRON- to the last bite
-PRON- be amazed that -PRON- have almost finish the entire strip
-PRON- cook both steak perfectly m rare
-PRON- order the brussel sprout with bacon and the mushroom plate for -PRON- side and really enjoy both
-PRON- be glad not to have order something more heavy because -PRON- be stuff by the end of the meal

-PRON- be so happy -PRON- include rating for the wine that be rat 90 point or high
so -PRON- be able to choose a bottle that be guarantee to be good
-PRON- even take a photo of the bottle
so -PRON- can try to purchase -PRON- elsewhere
the trio of dessert -PRON- provide be amazing as well
-PRON- favorite be the coconut cream pie but the cheesecake and chocolate cake be also delicious
-PRON- have absolutely no criticism to offer because the entire experience be remarkable
thank -PRON- dominic and the capital grill for provide such a wonderful experience for -PRON- friend 's birthday
-PRON- will definitely be back
y e s.
now although this restaurant feel a teensy bit like a chain restaurant must have be the look and feel of the menu and the paper wrap breadstick appetizer -PRON- still enjoy -PRON- immensely
just make sure -PRON- can find -PRON- on -PRON- own accord since not one staff member -PRON- ask at the venetian know where -PRON- be
strange
-PRON- start the night off with the squash fritti which be basically a french fry in squash form
-PRON- be a fan of anything fry so -PRON- can not really go wrong here
the fritti be perfectly crispy also a plus in -PRON- book
-PRON- order the braise pork shoulder which -PRON- be tell by two server be the good thing on the menu
-PRON- be melt in -PRON- mouth delicious
this be a no nonsense dish for those who like meat
very few frill just some vegetable sprinkle on top and some balsamic around the plate
both compliment this dish very well
that be really all an avid meat lover like -PRON- can ask for
-PRON- friend who din with -PRON- be admittedly not adventurous when -PRON- come to food so -PRON- stick with the spaghetti and meatball
-PRON- get one bite of a meatball which -PRON- could barely pry away from -PRON- on account of -PRON- love -PRON- so much
hard for -PRON- to tell much about -PRON- in one bite but -PRON- seem like a very standard meatball
-PRON- finish off the meal with a dark chocolate cake dark chocolate gelato graham cracker gelato and meringue all tuck into a martini shape glass
very yummy and also a recommendation from -PRON- fabulous server from turin
so sorry
-PRON- fail to get -PRON- name
service be fabulous and all server within a 10 table radius be attentive and helpful regardless of whether -PRON- be -PRON- responsibility or not
last but not least -PRON- have to mention the music selection
since mario have be ding for -PRON- music choice at babbo before -PRON- must commend -PRON- black crowes song flow from the speaker inside
a little sister luck never hurt anyone before
-PRON- be sure the owner be nice
so -PRON- hate to write this
the service be bad
only the owner work the floor
and the food be not good at all
-PRON- get good rating
-PRON- believe from people that live in the neighborhood
for the life of -PRON-
-PRON- do not know why -PRON- just do not make -PRON- order at the counter because the service be so slow
-PRON- always come here when -PRON- be in vegas because -PRON- be good fast and cheap
-PRON- come for the sandwich and soup although -PRON- do have salad
-PRON- order the holiday turkey and cranberry sandwich on wheat bread and the tomato soup that come with crouton
-PRON- bread be good and -PRON- get full quickly instead of go to a restaurant wait longer for -PRON- food to come out
so great to have -PRON- back
-PRON- live in kansas city where this restaurant be create
-PRON- wife and -PRON- be regular at the henderson location before -PRON- close -PRON-

yelp 100 challenge 27
-PRON- be about four year ago that -PRON- be in town and din at todds for the first time
tonight -PRON- be able to return once again
-PRON- server anthony be excellent very attentive
-PRON- start -PRON- meal with the fry calamari and aioli dipping sauce
not sure what be up with the calamari tonight
-PRON- seem as though -PRON- be leave in the fryer too long as -PRON- be a tad chewy and a little on the greasy side
additionally the batter be flavorless
enough say about the appetizer
on the other hand -PRON- beet salad serve on cold plate with golden beet fennel mixed green be delicious
the dressing be light and do not weigh down or over power the other ingredient
-PRON- hubby order the tuna tartare serve with wasabi mash excellent
the fish be sashimi grade so very tender and the sauce be equally delicious
-PRON- order the mahi mahi stuff with crab and serve with mixed veggie
the fish be excellent and the veggie tender crisp
both entree be present beautifully
as for dessert -PRON- be stuff so -PRON- pass this time
ample free parking out front
reservation helpful on the weekend

-PRON- right next to rubios
and -PRON- would never know -PRON-
right off eastern and the freeway
excellent service and sushi

when -PRON- go to pick up -PRON- food not only be the restaurant busy
but there be three of -PRON- pick up -PRON- take out
always a good sign
-PRON- get the green curry with seafood hot
hot be hot not americanize hot
-PRON- love good flavor spicy food and this be -PRON-
some of the seafood be a bit chewey but overall -PRON- like -PRON-
-PRON- roommate have the fried garlic with chicken mild and -PRON- be good too
definitely will be go back
the first time -PRON- ever eat at hanny 's -PRON- be not impressed so when -PRON- husband want to eat here -PRON- be not that enthuse
luckily for -PRON- the restaurant -PRON- want to go to in downtown phoenix have a 30 + minute wait so -PRON- head over to hanny 's because -PRON- be not one to wait
-PRON- be seat right away and -PRON- order the cauliflower calabrese shrimp prosciutto appetizer and the carne pizza
-PRON- also order the peach porch tea
to -PRON- surprise everything be good
the cauliflower have a good spicy kick the shrimp prosciutto be large and flavorful and the pizza have so much meat
although -PRON- be not a big fan of the crust -PRON- be thin and crunchy but -PRON- taste stale -PRON- still eat -PRON- though as long as -PRON- have meat with every bite -PRON- be good with -PRON-
service be attentive and -PRON- like the trendy atmosphere
-PRON- like this mall
not as cheap as other outlets in the states but the price be decent
banana republic shirt normally go around $ 40 and pant normally go around $ 50
coat be around $ 299
other store include h&m not an outlet a pet store -PRON- be not a pet lover a decent and very busy food court build a bear not an outlet gap that sell cheap casual clothe and nike store
there be purdy 's for chocolate lover
holt last can have some good saving but can still be expensive
the good deal could come from danier leather if -PRON- do not mind out of season jacket and accessory
not a lot of restaurant nearby
this be a very busy mall during holiday and during weekend but empty during weeknight
-PRON- normally shop around tuesday or wednesday when people will not push -PRON- and rub elbow with -PRON- gross
soon there will be lego land
so -PRON- kid can play while -PRON- shop
come for cheap find but this be not a fashionista mall
the quality even at br store be outlet quality
this place be amazing
the pho be out of control
-PRON- brave the cambodian bowl and thoroughly enjoy the fry rice with chicken shrimp and steak and -PRON- ribeye plate with fry rice make -PRON- mouth water think about -PRON- pic
very reasonably price as nearly every dinner dish on the menu be under $ 12
if -PRON- want something high end -PRON- have a lobster plate and a lobster soup multiple cut of steak and -PRON- can even order a burner plate for two or four and cook -PRON- own scallop shrimp pork beef and lamb
the food sometimes take a little while but the place be so nice and quiet that -PRON- just never go when -PRON- be rush
take -PRON- time and study -PRON- huge menu and -PRON- will never be disappoint
the first time -PRON- step through the front door of clinton 's be for brunch
-PRON- be not bad
-PRON- have a bar feel so -PRON- be not -PRON- typical family brunch place
but -PRON- be decent enough
comfortable and quiet -PRON- be a fine time
this review be for -PRON- friday saturday night
when -PRON- open the backdoor which -PRON- never know exist to reveal a dance floor and stage
-PRON- be not the small venue -PRON- have be in
supermarket have a small dance floor but -PRON- always pack
clinton 's on the other hand be slightly large and not full
enough room to maneuver around to get to and from the bar
that be probably the only thing -PRON- like about clinton 's
the crowd be not -PRON- forte
-PRON- be 24 and -PRON- think -PRON- cater to old patron nothing wrong with that just not for -PRON-
the music and vibe -PRON- get from the place be just not great
-PRON- stick with -PRON- friend that night
-PRON- catch up and leave for korean food afterwards
-PRON- hardly dance and do not have the small inkling to
-PRON- feel confused and a bit awkward the whole night
-PRON- do not know how to dance to rock music -PRON- be use to krump
overall clinton 's be ok for brunch
-PRON- would visit somewhere else if -PRON- be look to dance
even supermarket be a bit better and -PRON- all know how -PRON- feel about that place
the food be great and the dessert even better
totally recommend this place specially if -PRON- like authentic egyptian food
atmosphere 10\/10 customer service 9\/10 price(10\/10
the staff at this shop be very polite and well knowledgeable all well not be overly persisten on sale technique
-PRON- do not mind customer hang around and conversating
the atmosphere be clean well organized and have a water dispenser the only issue be -PRON- do not have a washroom for customer
the price at this shop be average although -PRON- do have a great price matching system
dash hold a good relationship with customer and will probably continue to add more loyal customer to -PRON- database
-PRON- would reccomend this shop for someone look to pick up quick part or for anyone look for a place to hang out and vape
very good
service be great
-PRON- daughter and -PRON- go there for the first time the night before last
-PRON- be a pretty busy dinner crowd and -PRON- be greet by two gentleman at the front
as -PRON- do not have a reservation -PRON- fully expect to wait if necessary
the wait be brief and the decor be nice along with the hustle of the crowed\/staff the place be alive
that seat -PRON- at a small round table that -PRON- daughter love
-PRON- have a little european feel -PRON- say
-PRON- be greet be a young lady name rachel -PRON- be -PRON- server
and -PRON- be fantastic very attentive with an easy approach
-PRON- start with some escargot and charcuterie
the escargot be great however the charcuterie be not -PRON- favorite
not that -PRON- be bad
-PRON- just find the pate a little dry and -PRON- give -PRON- cheddar cheese with -PRON- and the very firm sausage be cut way to thick almost impossible to chew
but the veggie be great
-PRON- then move in to entree -PRON- have the beef burgunion sp)while -PRON- daughter have the duck both be wonderful
now what really stand out in -PRON- experience be the all around service -PRON- see before -PRON- where serve but right after rachel have take -PRON- order -PRON- dawn on -PRON- that -PRON- have forget to request no mushroom in -PRON- dish
so one of the gentleman who sit -PRON- be walk by and -PRON- express the situation to -PRON-
-PRON- assure -PRON- that -PRON- would be no problem and walk to the back
what be impressive there be that -PRON- be sure the kitchen have not get -PRON- order yet because -PRON- have not even receive -PRON- app yet
so clearly the communication amongst the staff be stellar
in -PRON- experience the food be very good and the service be great -PRON- will defiantly be go back
-PRON- be amazing
fresh sushi and great service
-PRON- be very happy -PRON- decide last minute to try m&j.
-PRON- will def be back
always make -PRON- hair look so good
will not go to anyone else for color
-PRON- be the queen of the balayage technique that everyone be want
will not be disappoint
the food be okay but the service be terrible
-PRON- be sit on the patio and eventually move inside but all the server be a disaster can not get anyone 's attention to order a forget meal wrong beer serve unfamiliarity with the menu and just snotty attitude in general
-PRON- will not be come back
worst in n out ever
the staff be very friendly however the food be a disaster
the burger be dry and the fry taste like week old cardboard
-PRON- order fry animal style and the sauce be dry on top of the fry as if -PRON- be make long before
the staff be very nice and give -PRON- new fry but -PRON- be still terrible
-PRON- end up throw -PRON- away
maybe because this be a tourist area -PRON- have lose the quality aspect but definitely skip -PRON-
not worth the trip at all
-PRON- and -PRON- boyfriend go here just the other day
the resturaunt be really nice and -PRON- and -PRON- do not make reservation so -PRON- end up side in the bar area
surprisingly the service be still pretty great
-PRON- be definitely busy because -PRON- be a weekend night
-PRON- server be a delight
-PRON- know the menu and answer all the question that -PRON- have
-PRON- get the wild salmon $ 32 which be fantastic
-PRON- literally melt in -PRON- mouth
-PRON- boyfriend get the swordfish about $ 30 as well
-PRON- try -PRON- and -PRON- be different
but -PRON- be still really good
-PRON- get 3 side mash potato macaroni and the steamed broccoli which be all good
and -PRON- both get a beer
-PRON- have see review before -PRON- come here
so -PRON- know -PRON- have to try the butter cake
and -PRON- be amazing
-PRON- would go there again just for that
but -PRON- bill come out to be about $ 145 include the tip
so go here on a special occasion if -PRON- can not afford such an expensive dinner on the regular
the food be great
but the service really make this place what -PRON- be
this be a small shop at yonge and wellesley that have a portrait studio but also do printing
-PRON- have a great selection of frame
the girl work be quite friendly and helpful
-PRON- price seem very reasonable though even if -PRON- be a little high -PRON- would go back just for the great service
chicken be melt in -PRON- mouth
food be great but the experience be make by the manager on duty
-PRON- be the happy fast food manager -PRON- have ever come across especially in the drive thru
another great thing be -PRON- know the food be fresh
how -PRON- ask
-PRON- be still hot when -PRON- get back to -PRON- office 10 min away
the value be there because -PRON- be great food at a reasonable price
great service great staff
come here expect to get a decent nonsmoking room but find that price surge even though the person over the phone tell -PRON- if -PRON- check in early than usual -PRON- would be another extra $ 15 or $ 50 -PRON- must have misheard but -PRON- be either $ 15 or $ 50
check in early end up be another $ 135 along with -PRON- reservation 64 $ and -PRON- get a smoking room no other non smoking room be available even though the person over the phone tell -PRON- many room be available
the smoky room be terrible
-PRON- barely get any sleep and cough a lot but have no choice but to stay there
extremely dissatisfied with this place
-PRON- be pretty mediocre
starbucks downstairs be pretty nice but the staff over the phone just do not communicate well
also just read a review that someone get bedbug
-PRON- be just so disgusted and hope -PRON- do not get bedbug
never come back
good turkey dinner -PRON- have find in las vegas
sunday special $ 10.79 include soup or salad roasted turkey mash potato dressing vegetable dessert
large portion
so -PRON- better be hungry however -PRON- be also great leftover
great coffee
love the patio and indoor seating
great foam art as well
do -PRON- get any good than this
whatev -PRON- be imagine -PRON- be right
-PRON- be ok -PRON- be a lot of food for the money
the thanksgiving monday dinner be one of the most depressing experience available
try -PRON- -PRON- will not be disappoint but make sure -PRON- have thanksgiving dinner with -PRON- family the day before
if -PRON- do not -PRON- really will be depressing not entertaining\/depress for other
this be a great restaurant in a random location
hint
-PRON- can request free limo service from anywhere on the strip
-PRON- be quite small so definitely make a reservation
the ambiance and decor be the true draw of this spot
-PRON- be very old school vegas
there be old school picture of vegas and various celebrity all around the restaurant and bar
at the rear of the restaurant be the bar
there be video poker of course
hint if wait at the bar for a table to be ready -PRON- can not transfer -PRON- drink bill to -PRON- table so -PRON- must pay the bartender before be seat at -PRON- table
there be several cocktail and a few wine by the glass
the wine menu be a little underwhelming
despite try to be more upscale and fancy ish this be a rather casual spot
there be kid run around and lot of folk in jean and sweatshirt
the live music be a great touch and add to the ambiance and decor
however -PRON- also escalate the noise level
between the band and the patron -PRON- could not even hear each other and -PRON- be at a tiny two person table
hint request a booth on the far side from the band
there be some seriously awful acoustic in this place
the noise level and the inability to carry on a conversation with -PRON- date really kill the romance
for food -PRON- opt for a side caesar salad the bone in ribeye steak flambe and the gypsy pasta
the food portion be pretty generous
the salad be nothing of note
hint
while there be free bread -PRON- do not give -PRON- olive oil and balsamic vinegar just butter
the steak be tasty but not mouthwater or crave worthy
the gypsy pasta be crazy spicy and -PRON- love spicy
-PRON- be almost too much -PRON- be so spicy
and the pasta be 1 lb so -PRON- be a significantly large portion
the service be nice and friendly
-PRON- water be never empty -PRON- be check on etc etc
all in all -PRON- like the concept which be what give -PRON- the 4 star
and -PRON- would be willing to come back perhaps on a less busy night and try some other menu item
but -PRON- do not love what -PRON- order and the noise level seriously dampen -PRON- experience
while a good spot if -PRON- be look for a vintage vegas vibe if -PRON- be look for a nice romantic restaurant this be not that spot
but totally good for experience that old school vegas feel
-PRON- have stay here twice and both time -PRON- have work out really well
-PRON- last stay
-PRON- be in a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom suite which be perfect for a work play trip in vegas with co worker
internet be solid location be about a 15 minute walk to the strip
parking be never a problem and there be panera and other shop right near by
the breakfast and other treat that be setup around dinner make this hotel an easy choice anytime -PRON- come to las vegas
although the ground be still impressive the once 5 star resort be no more
since the take over by mgm sadly the bellagio be not what -PRON- use to be
-PRON- main issue be with the hotel room
the remodel that take place within the last year to every room in the entire hotel be a huge mistake
the new bright cheap and disgusting décor replace what once be a room full of classic neutral rich tone that go with the rest of the hotel
the new room feel completely out of place in the bellagio and make -PRON- feel like -PRON- be actually stay at a cheap generic hotel
sadly -PRON- will never be stay at the bellagio again
but -PRON- will most certainly visit the resort for the shopping din and gambling
jesus
4 small piece of fish for 13 $ seriously
-PRON- bill be $ 130 and -PRON- go away still hungry
spicy bean be great
the food be good the service be great but the portion be just a little bit small for how much -PRON- pay
the decor be amazing
that be -PRON- first impression
the service be great as well
-PRON- order 1 large pizza with extra cheese and chocolate with hot fudge
all of it be amazing
-PRON- be pleased and would recommend -PRON- to everyone
come to eggslut on a saturday morning ready for a hangover cure and be not disappoint
there be a small line probably 20 people in front of -PRON- but -PRON- be less than a 10 minute wait to get to the counter
there be multiple menu on the wall though so -PRON- can decide what -PRON- want before -PRON- get there
yay efficiency
-PRON- order the bacon egg cheese sandwich while -PRON- friend order the signature slut
-PRON- also have coffee and orange juice
everything be just great and price be on point for a quick bite in vegas about $ 10 $ 15 per person depend on whether or not -PRON- get drink
one reason -PRON- do not get the slut be because -PRON- be afraid the baguette would be too hard
surprise -PRON- be not
-PRON- will definitely be get that next time
service be welcome friendly and prompt
one of -PRON- favorite feature be the open kitchen allow -PRON- to see everything be make fresh in front of -PRON-
downside be that there be not a lot of seating
-PRON- can find somewhere in the lobby to sit but designate table would be a bit good
eggslut be definitely someplace
-PRON- would come back to for a solid hangover breakfast
an epic meal a must if -PRON- be in montreal
the brilliant chef picard -PRON- staff
aim to please all -PRON- sens
rambunctious ambiance meticulous attentive service beautifully flavored dishes huge portions all in all one of the most lavish perfect dining experiences of all -PRON- travel
now that be some achievement friends
cause -PRON- have at least from the gastronomical world the highest standards expectations
the good donut -PRON- have find in cleveland
-PRON- have try -PRON- at event and such but last week go in to grab a dozen
-PRON- have ton of flavor and look more like dessert than donut
-PRON- rotate flavor daily and do not have sign post so -PRON- have to ask what be what
some of the flavor -PRON- get be smore kit kat reese 's peanut butter cup key lime banana split maple bacon death by chocolate german chocolate and a couple more
the chocolate one be all delicious with frost stack a mile high
-PRON- be less of a fan of the banana split and key lime
this cafe actually make the us custom an enjoyable experience
-PRON- have have an easy time cross the border than order food here
-PRON- be first greet by many sign that command -PRON- to line up in different spot depend on what -PRON- be order
there be one for food and one for coffee drink and pastry
if -PRON- dare order a bagel at the drink and pastry only lineup prepare to be flame by the cashier
even though someone else have just tell -PRON- earlier to order -PRON- snack here
of course the cashier be much nice to the middle aged non asian lady behind -PRON- too and practically beam and smile at -PRON- the whole time
otherwise good selection of quiche and coffee mug -PRON- can barely hold onto
the server scoff when -PRON- ask for an extra tray to balance -PRON- drink like -PRON- know a decent human being
-PRON- finally throw one at -PRON- to the side
-PRON- fear for -PRON- life thereafter
as with the us custom be white a little old and a regular visitor go a long way
the lion and dragon be a complete disappointment
-PRON- have be there a number of time and the bar staff be rude and undisciplined
-PRON- can be quite obnoxious and be solely self absorb
the bar -PRON- be poorly construct and the washroom be a share mens\/women and be quite unsitely
the food price be way above what -PRON- should be for an establishment of that sort
-PRON- have never eat the food here so this review be only for the ice cream
pistachio and rosewater ice cream
come on
yes
there need not be anything else say
be not too bad from texas so use to big dance floor and such
do like the fact there be not too much hip hop dancing

a bit disappointed in the drink though
cost be great can not beat $ 2.25 for well on special but dang
-PRON- would like to be able to taste some whiskey
drink taste like coke
all in all not too shabby
-PRON- just discover the cinemark in mesa yesterday afternoon when -PRON- be the only theater in the area that still have relatively last minute opening night ticket for the dark knight available online

-PRON- be awesome
right up there with moosehead and tavern on the track
love the wing but the good thing about this place be the staff

-PRON- mention -PRON- to the manager just to ask to be sure -PRON- order correctly and -PRON- mention that the chef who be usually there be off for the holiday and apologize
-PRON- do not care much eat every bite
-PRON- understand -PRON- be new year 's day
and -PRON- do not expect place to be fully staff
when -PRON- go to pay -PRON- see -PRON- give -PRON- a big discount very nice of -PRON-

a few week ago -PRON- book rapunzel for -PRON- daughter 's 5th birthday party
today be -PRON- birthday and no one show up
-PRON- do not get a phone call or anything
-PRON- daughter be very sad that rapunzel do not come
from the last review -PRON- look like this have happen before

very sad
do not understand good review at all
would not recommend at all
-PRON- rec'd a $ 10 gift card
so go to check -PRON- out by order something basic grill cheese sandwich and tomato bisque soup
figure if that be good -PRON- would order more
first ventillation be poor and smell of grease be overpower
soup be so thick -PRON- be like red sludge load with overloaded chuck of partially cook onion not even a good flavor and far far from be a bisque
cheese sandwich be not hot enough and cheese be like rubber
french fry be just okay
-PRON- say -PRON- be down home southern cooking to -PRON-
-PRON- be just a greasy spoon with a fancy name and an insult to southern food
maybe other entree be good
-PRON- contention be and always will be if -PRON- be on the menu
and -PRON- be be serve
-PRON- should all be up to par and good
only plus be the waiter be very friendly and punctual
first time here
and -PRON- be great

-PRON- be expensive and do not take -PRON- where -PRON- want to go
nice job city manager
-PRON- would think that -PRON- would drop -PRON- off at the convention center
nope
-PRON- seriously drop -PRON- off about 1\/2 1\/4 mile away from the convention center at which point -PRON- have to walk across the entire huge black asphalt parking lot in the 100 + heat
what a fucking joke
if -PRON- have a car just drive and park on site
-PRON- be way easy
great movie theatre -PRON- have a a bit of a small town feel to -PRON- if that make sense and -PRON- like that
-PRON- be more tuck away and less crowded than most of the movie theatre -PRON- have be to but without sacrifice any quality
the chair recline just like the more modern theatre
-PRON- would give a 5 star but these lady take every customer in the buffet line except -PRON- and -PRON- family
-PRON- do not even bother to look at -PRON-
-PRON- have to go to a different casino to have family night
whatev i use to be a regular but -PRON- every often now
-PRON- love dr trish not only be -PRON- care knowledgeable and professional -PRON- should be a comedian
schleusner chiropractic offer -PRON- a first visit on very short notice -PRON- be experience extreme pain in -PRON- neck and shoulder due to past injury to the point of nearly pass out
dr trish order up xray in house no need to drive around town to get xray and immediately make -PRON- neck and back adjustment provide instant relief
-PRON- highly recommend if -PRON- in need of chiropractic care this be the place to be
a big ole thank -PRON- to the doctor and staff for be so amazing
awesome place
-PRON- love the decor and atmosphere
food be great and the staff be really nice
the view be very nice
that say this be -PRON- second visit and -PRON- have truly hop the food have improve or -PRON- just have an off night
no such luck
-PRON- all order something different and the only thing -PRON- all like be the salad
wait staff be very nice
if -PRON- want a beautiful romantic place for dinner -PRON- have that
but for the price -PRON- charge the food be unacceptable
-PRON- never mind pay top dollar for food
that be as good as -PRON- be price
so -PRON- get a promo in the mail offer -PRON- a $ 100 credit to a service that -PRON- have not try yet at dolce massage
-PRON- have always hear that the owner be very involved in networking\/customer service but this seem incredibly generous
-PRON- decide to go to give dolce one more chance to redeem -PRON- after -PRON- past awful experience and -PRON- really do
-PRON- schedule a massage with carman and show up about 10 minute early
-PRON- get to wait in -PRON- relaxation room
-PRON- be a great room with comfy couch magazine and beautiful wall
the only drawback be that the back wall be open to a sort of back hallway that the employee use
-PRON- be a little bit of a mood killer to hear three girl walk through there and loudly make fun of some woman 's outfit
luckily carman show up shortly after
-PRON- lead -PRON- back to a room with a beautiful chandelier over the table all the while chat politely
the massage really be fantastic
seriously -PRON- have have massage before that feel like -PRON- go by so quickly the end just when -PRON- be start to get good
this be the complete opposite
-PRON- feel like -PRON- last forever in a good way
carmen be very sweet to talk to and be excellent at determine all the important pressure point in -PRON- shoulder
-PRON- also use great deep tissue technique really relieve a lot of the tension -PRON- have
one thing -PRON- still do not like about dolce be how much -PRON- feel like -PRON- push product on -PRON-
so -PRON- really appreciate that carman have only select a karmi neck wrap
-PRON- be not expensive and be actually directly relate what -PRON- need and what -PRON- talk about during -PRON- massage
so -PRON- buy -PRON- and -PRON- really love -PRON- definitely help loosen muscle in -PRON- shoulder
overall this be a great experience -PRON- feel so relaxed and pamper
and -PRON- never would have go back if -PRON- be not for the generous coupon in the mail but -PRON- be glad -PRON- do

the different worker employee'd

adam stay in constant contact with -PRON- during the construction process and be quick to address any need and\/or concern that -PRON- have
-PRON- ability to listen and communicate effectively eliminate any and all concern that arise on -PRON- part due to the complexity and size of -PRON- pergolas
-PRON- love -PRON- newly style patio and back yard area

-PRON- look forward to the many year of enjoyment that will come due to -PRON- professionalism and expertise
be sell a 2016 ram 6 cylinder over $ 4k above the price of a v8

no response after repeatedly call to get a refund on -PRON- warranty and gap
stay away

-PRON- be keep in contact every step of the way
-PRON- have a groupon for a spa mani\/pedi
the technician be very nice but the service receive be not impressive and be not as advertise
-PRON- be not sure how -PRON- receive a spa manicure with a simple filing of -PRON- nail
-PRON- can not even imagine spend full price
this place be the absolute bad
-PRON- bring -PRON- two year old niece here to play and -PRON- have some ball for all the kid to share and play with and a little boy get on top of -PRON- niece and bite -PRON- so hard in the back just because -PRON- take the ball when -PRON- come to -PRON-
-PRON- have the big bloody bruise on -PRON- back and the staff do absolutely nothing at all
-PRON- do not even ask the lady and -PRON- son to leave like -PRON- be completely normal and ok for a child to bite and bruise another child
-PRON- have to ask for a first aid kit or at least a bandaid before -PRON- even think to bring one
the guy that be supervise that area be even more useless -PRON- do not even see what happen
be not be -PRON- job to watch over the kid and make sure thing like this do not happen
horrible customer service very unsafe and unprofessional
-PRON- have no policy or regulation when -PRON- come to these kind of thing
-PRON- bring -PRON- here to have fun not to get hurt or but by other kid
-PRON- have be to this establishment 3 time
-PRON- decide not to write a review after -PRON- first visit because -PRON- know people have bad day sometimes no one be perfect
so -PRON- want to go a couple more time so that -PRON- could give -PRON- a fair review
sadly every experience be the same
every time -PRON- have go -PRON- have be one of the first customer of the day
this establishment open at 10 am however on -PRON- first visit the owner do not show up to open the door for the several wait client until around 11
-PRON- give no apology for any inconvenience that this may have cause anyone seem very unbothered by -PRON- tardiness
after open the salon the stylist that -PRON- be there to see have a 10:00 appt with do not arrive until noon
not only have -PRON- be wait but another young lady have be wait since 9 be also due to the fact that -PRON- book an appointment with rissa on style seat the appointment on there do not reflect the business nor the stylist already book appointment
so after arrive to -PRON- appointment on time -PRON- have 1 person ahead of -PRON-
once rissa arrive -PRON- tell the client ahead of -PRON- to sit in -PRON- chair
-PRON- be not very friendly or pleasant at all
-PRON- sit there in the shop for 2 hour and -PRON- do not acknowledge -PRON- -PRON- customer at all
the shop be one open area
so -PRON- be right there watch -PRON- do hair the entire time
-PRON- do however
notice -PRON- look at -PRON- a couple of time
so -PRON- smile at -PRON-
and -PRON- just look away
-PRON- do not seem like much of a people person or a morning person at all
-PRON- be a very unwelcom uncomfortable visit
as a customer no one want to feel like a burden
once -PRON- sit in -PRON- chair -PRON- introduce -PRON- and -PRON- act as though -PRON- do not even hear -PRON- dryly ask -PRON- what -PRON- be have do
-PRON- tell -PRON- and -PRON- cop an attitude ask why -PRON- want -PRON- like that
-PRON- be think to -PRON-
excuse -PRON- be not -PRON- a stylist offer a service that -PRON- be here for
once again an unwelcoming awkward moment
after -PRON- be all say do -PRON- hair turn out beautiful
rissa be very talented at styling hair -PRON- can not say the same about the quality of the sew in -PRON- give -PRON- as -PRON- have have 2 sew in by -PRON- and have have to go back several time because the piece keep come out or the string be unravel
-PRON- have notice that tammy the owner allow rissa to treat -PRON- client any type of way do not get involve
-PRON- be not sure how good of a business practice that is however to each -PRON- own
rissa need to learn to humble -PRON- because in this world -PRON- get more with sugar than -PRON- will with shit
-PRON- attitude be shitty
unfortunately there be not many great stylist in the phoenix area rissa do amazing style -PRON- definitely have a gift
-PRON- be go to try go to -PRON- a few more time
-PRON- think of this place like -PRON- think of a relationship with a no good man that have great bedroom skill but be not good in any other department
the business owner have a very nice set up
-PRON- would love to see this black own business prosper so hopefully -PRON- will read this review take the constructive criticism apply -PRON- as -PRON- would like to continue be a customer
-PRON- be very excited to try this place after read all the positive review and also see -PRON- extensive menu
upon arrive -PRON- be surprised to see just how small this place be the picture make -PRON- look big and also surprised to see several leak from the ceiling
many table be not available to be use because there be giant bucket at or near -PRON- catch water that fall from the ceiling -PRON- have a storm a day before
kind of off put
but -PRON- decide to stay and give -PRON- a try anyway
the husband decide to have a gyro since -PRON- logic tell -PRON- that a euro cafe should have the good gyro
the waitress assure -PRON- that -PRON- would be the good gyro -PRON- have ever have
-PRON- opt for the pork molise which be pork tenderloin wrap in bacon with roasted garlic caramelize onion apricot and cherry glaze with horseradish mash potato
-PRON- be inform by the waitress that there be no change to any item on -PRON- menu which be fine with -PRON-
however -PRON- think -PRON- ridiculous that -PRON- be completely unwilling to compromise in the case of food allergy
as a restaurant -PRON- feel -PRON- have an obligation to do that
anyways the salad that come before -PRON- meal be good thank to the feta dressing
-PRON- be very good dressing and -PRON- husband be disappoint when -PRON- get -PRON- gyro and -PRON- do not have that feta dress much less any feta for that matter
feta be a key component of a gyro -PRON- always think
-PRON- also say that the yogurt sauce do not have any flavor
correct -PRON- if -PRON- be wrong but be not tiziki sauce suppose to be present on gyro
needless to say this be not the good gyro the hub have ever have and -PRON- inform -PRON- that -PRON- make good one at home use roast beef and ranch dress
haha
as for -PRON- meal -PRON- be ok
but honestly -PRON- taste like something -PRON- have make at home out of the crock pot
-PRON- be sorry
but when -PRON- go to a restaurant -PRON- expect to be wow and to have a meal that -PRON- do not feel like -PRON- could replicate at home
anyways -PRON- be all about second chance so if someone want to go here -PRON- would go
but -PRON- do not know if -PRON- have enough potential for -PRON- to go back on -PRON- own
-PRON- love this place
so fancy clean and relaxing
this be -PRON- second time here now
and -PRON- bring -PRON- mom with -PRON- to try out -PRON- pearl spa pedicure

-PRON- be sure people can knock off star if -PRON- steak do not come out to -PRON- liking heck -PRON- would too but all four of our come out exactly as -PRON- want -PRON- to
-PRON- be not a big fan of ermiril 's show nor be -PRON- a fan of -PRON- personality
despite have -PRON- name associate with this restaurant -PRON- feel that if -PRON- be not the one cook -PRON- meal then -PRON- be not really -PRON- food
whoever the chef be that night sure have -PRON- mojo go that be for sure
the cocktail shrimp appetizer be amazing
cocktail shrimp -PRON- say
how different can that be from bellagio 's buffet where -PRON- can get like 1000 in one sit if -PRON- want
well consider -PRON- be save -PRON- stomach for more desirable substance the dish contain eight snicker bar sized prawn drizzle with a fine cocktail sauce that have a nice kick to -PRON-
-PRON- be more than enough to satiate -PRON- before the main course
when -PRON- meat come out -PRON- buddy and -PRON- could not stop drool
the girl have to laugh as -PRON- softball size fillet 's look more like golf ball in comparison to -PRON- full sized cow bone in rib eyes
literally the size of the plate -PRON- and at least 1.5 inch thick
vegans would run in fear at the sheer size of this holy beast
the rib eye be cook perfectly throughout
medium rare a beautiful mix of pink and red with a perfectly char request exterior that sear all the juice in and add wonderful flavor to the aged meat
if this be not a proper meal -PRON- would have go to town on the bone like caveman at the end
truly magnificent
and to think -PRON- be offer a generous cut porterhouse on the menu as well
that may have be size of two cow 40 50 ounce per what -PRON- waiter quote
the side be just as delightful
served family style the asparagus be grill perfectly the potato fingerling roast with a beautiful blend of butter and garlic and the mushroom medley be burst with flavor
-PRON- will also add that the dinner roll be probably some of the good -PRON- have ever have
soft and fresh hot out of the oven -PRON- have a nice sweetness to -PRON- and the fresh churned butter add an exquisite country taste as well
dessert consist of an excellent bread pudding with a scoop or oreo ice cream along with a banana fosters cream pie
both be amazingly good
-PRON- have no idea how -PRON- stomach -PRON- but -PRON- be a nice finish touch
the wine list be extensive and amazing
-PRON- be one of the few restaurant in vegas that serve one of -PRON- favorite winery wine neal
-PRON- have an absolutely dazzle bottle of cabernet sauvignon that -PRON- have to order another
needless to say both gentleman slug down 75 of a bottle each
the service be excellent
-PRON- waiter be attentive at all time and be very alert to -PRON- need
the good waiter be those that know what -PRON- want without even have to signal or tell -PRON- and -PRON- waiter be just that good
a very elegant setting and locate in the walkway connect the palazo and venetian this be definitely one of the steakhouse in vegas -PRON- will frequent again
this be one of the more upscale restaurant at paris and -PRON- first dinner of the trip
after see the ridiculous line for the buffet -PRON- decide to give -PRON- a try
the price be not cheap and this be definitely part of the new swanky fine dining vegas
-PRON- be not that hungry so just order the lobster bisque and a caesar salad
-PRON- honey order the salmon with a side of mushroom
everything be delicious perfectly seasoned and cook
the bisque be probably the good -PRON- have ever have with large chunk of lobster and a smooth velvety texture
the waiter be a little huffy when -PRON- realize that -PRON- have forget to order the mushroom which be a little off put
-PRON- end up not put -PRON- on the bill which be nice of -PRON-
-PRON- also go lucky in that -PRON- be a featured restaurant for the month of august so all guest of paris get 20 off
the total bill be only $ 44 which be a steal for the quality and ambiance of the restaurant
-PRON- would definitely recommend this place but be prepare to spend some cash if -PRON- be look to live -PRON- up
amazing sport bar tv be amazing but the bartender have the personality of a rock
grant -PRON- be only one bartender but this be -PRON- first impression
-PRON- suck
okay
-PRON- just have the chicken taco
do not come here
bartender be an a hole and the food be very low quality and tasteless
excellent sushi
huge portion
amazing selection bento box and stir fry a favorite
shlay -PRON- waitress be a doll attentive and give fabulous suggestion
the manager matt brown be top notch
even with the back up because of weather -PRON- go above and beyond to make sure -PRON- get seat with -PRON- family outside to have a great meal and enjoy the breeze
every time -PRON- visit huntersville ezz be on the list of something -PRON- must do
-PRON- really do not know how much can be say about a shopping mall but -PRON- have a couple positive thing to mention aside from the shopping experience
first off this mall be keep clean pleasant and in working order
in other word -PRON- be not ghetto like some mall -PRON- have be to in the san francisco bay area
second -PRON- be glad that the mall be open to the public for those who like to go walk before the store open
-PRON- be nice to walk shelter from the outdoor element that -PRON- be all familiar with in the desert
make note that starbucks and cinnabon be open during the early hour for -PRON- consumption need
-PRON- find this gem on -PRON- yelp app while search great breakfast spot
-PRON- have every intention of wake up at 8 be the next day do -PRON- hair just enough to look cool but not try too hard and head to le cartet for breakfast on a friday
well -PRON- be jet lag and wake up at 10:30
half do -PRON- hair and rush down rue mcgill to try to catch breakfast but -PRON- be too late -PRON- be hand the lunch menu boo
-PRON- want to try to fit in with all the well dress staff and patron
so -PRON- pretend to understand the french menu and order what -PRON- think be a goat cheese almond and date salad
well what -PRON- get be a warm pate of goat cheese with almond and date in -PRON- serve over lettuce and a few piece of crostini
-PRON- be confused but keep up -PRON- -PRON- be a local and totally expect this act
-PRON- be pleasantly surprised with -PRON- selection
so much so that -PRON- come back for brunch the next day and have the brunch sucre
-PRON- be definitely a carb and sugar overload but worth -PRON-
capuccinos be small but tasty
each time -PRON- come here
-PRON- spend around $ 20 can
have to give this place five star
visit -PRON- friend here in az and -PRON- bring -PRON- here for happy hour
the food be delicious and drink be outstanding the service be awesome and the price could not be good
highly recommend this restaurant
very trendy and upbeat atmosphere
-PRON- do not have to wait at all which be surprising consider how crowded -PRON- seem
the waitress take -PRON- back to a more quiet area in the back of the restaurant for small party
-PRON- order off the menu and although small plentiful
there be also someone who wake around with small fish on -PRON- platter for anyone who want to take one right away
-PRON- get the edamame and a pork piece dish
these dish be fill with flavor and perfect starter
-PRON- first dish that -PRON- order that come out be the pork potsticker
these be probably the good pot sticker -PRON- have ever endure at any restaurant
next -PRON- get the summer california roll which be like any california roll but with mango and very crunchy crab
very light but still delicious
still to come be the pork raman noodle and the green tea crime brûlée
very excited
as -PRON- have get frail in -PRON- old age and -PRON- be so close by -PRON- be often easy to walk the half block for stale bread and a morsel of grey meat that cost $ 20 than -PRON- be to walk anywhere else
see as giant eagle be run by family from fox chapel -PRON- have always have a feeling that -PRON- place this dirty understocked apathetic and understaffed shameful disgrace of a grocery store in squirrel hill as a screw -PRON- to -PRON- neighborhood
the owner should be ashamed
please trader joe 's or any other store come to squirrel hill
upon look for a donut shop i find real donut on the web and decide to try -PRON- see -PRON- have great review
-PRON- drive by -PRON- quite often on the way to work
and -PRON- be very easy to find
-PRON- first visit -PRON- keep -PRON- order simple
-PRON- will say that the only thing that would have -PRON- return be the donut
-PRON- do not care for the service as -PRON- feel rush and unwelcomed from the moment that -PRON- set foot in the door despite the fact that all the review -PRON- read rave about the service be top notch maybe -PRON- be just the day
-PRON- order donut for -PRON- husband and -PRON- and luckily -PRON- both think that -PRON- selection be great price and taste amazing otherwise -PRON- would not even consider return
horrible company
have renaldo come out to check the billow gasket on -PRON- kenmore washer
-PRON- see -PRON- need replace and tell -PRON- no problem -PRON- home warranty company would positively cover the repair
-PRON- tell -PRON- if -PRON- pay -PRON- the $ 75 co pay in advance that total protect would cover the part for sure
-PRON- do not want to pay for something that have not be fix but -PRON- trick -PRON- into pay by say some company 's that do not collect the co pay in advance get deny for the repair
so stupid -PRON- give -PRON- the $ 75
one hour later -PRON- get a call from total protect say -PRON- do not and have never cover the cost of any type of gasket\/seal and this company have know for year that the part have never be cover
renaldo know exactly what -PRON- be do -sucker -PRON- into give -PRON- $ 75 know that -PRON- would be deny
-PRON- call shady willy 's handyman repair and ask for -PRON- money back and renaldo tell -PRON- -PRON- would not get pay back and to take -PRON- up with total protect
horrible company
do -PRON- a favor and call someone else
-PRON- end up here b\/c
-PRON- be cheapish and on the strip
and -PRON- be happily surprised
the room have have an upgrade and be fairly hip and the regular restaurant be great
really good burger
forgot what the br have
but -PRON- be also good(cheesesteak
extra bacon blt
-PRON- would eat there again
and -PRON- would stay there again
-PRON- also like that -PRON- be a super easy walk to the other casino and that -PRON- have a good poker room
won a bit at pai gow and at crap so that never hurt
i"d stay there again in a heartbeat
good unique
-PRON- kid like the peanut the peanut drop space ship and draw on the table and wall although apparently -PRON- be not suppose to add to the grafiti -PRON- find out
sunday kid eat free
otherwise pretty pricey for burger
would go back on a sunday again for a family treat
burger be certainly good
sweet potato chip be delicious
probably -PRON- favorite place to eat when -PRON- be crave some latin american fare
the arepas the way to go plus -PRON- cubano be top notch
the cheesy corn dip be great and so be the guac really in a place where everything be handmade -PRON- can not go wrong
-PRON- be a very small place though that have expand with a great deck but the kitchen be still small
if -PRON- be a person that write a review base solely on the speed of the service -PRON- will not like this place
but if -PRON- want to sit and enjoy -PRON- self -PRON- can not do much good
great location with fast service and cheap drink $ 5 for wine and beer
-PRON- pre game here while -PRON- wait for -PRON- friend to join -PRON- for the madonna concert great idea since the drink in the concert venue be $ 16 a piece
ouch
locate in waverly station this branch of wh smith be extortionate -PRON- guess -PRON- be to be expect give that -PRON- be locate in a busy train station
but -PRON- take the price a little bit too far
a walker bag of crisp be as much as 85p which be absolutely ridiculous
if -PRON- be feel peckish then forget -PRON- as -PRON- could find -PRON- fork out £ 4 for an old cardboard tasting sandwich
-PRON- do not understand why wh smith have to charge so much more when boot directly across from -PRON- charge the exact same price as all -PRON- be other store include the fabulous £ 2.99 meal deal
do not be catch out in this rip off wh smith if -PRON- need something urgently then head to boots instead
the magazine be paper be just the same retail price but
for anything else do -PRON- a favour and do not bother as -PRON- be a rip off
-PRON- have be come to this store since last may when the puppy -PRON- purchase from a breeder be be feed a unique brand of dog food and -PRON- decide to put -PRON- other dog on the same food
-PRON- be about a 30 min drive from -PRON- house and luckily since the food be in 40 lb sack and -PRON- remain dog be tiny -PRON- only have to buy -PRON- every 5 month or so
but this last experience be the bad
if not for the unique food and the great volume pricing -PRON- would never come back because of the terrible customer service there
this time -PRON- have just recently move to a new address within the same plaza
this be not advertise on the website so when -PRON- have drive around where the place use to be for about 5 minute -PRON- call and be rudely tell that -PRON- be in another spot
-PRON- remain polite to the young maybe early 20
employee who answer the phone
another 5 minute later that s how long -PRON- take to decipher that the new location be only a couple building behind the original one but very confusing when that be not tell to -PRON- by the person -PRON- ask for direction -PRON- make -PRON- to the store
-PRON- husband grab the 40 lb bag and be offer no assistance by the young man who look like -PRON- do not care to be there as -PRON- hubby struggle to lift the heavy bag onto the high counter
and when -PRON- politely ask if there be someone to speak to in order to update the address on the company 's website -PRON- be meet with more rudeness
the young employee clearly do not care about customer or -PRON- job
-PRON- look like -PRON- hat have to be there in the first place
-PRON- have since call 3 time try to reach the person -PRON- be tell to speak to about the site someone name frank just so -PRON- could tell -PRON- how rude -PRON- employee be but every time i call -PRON- be conveniently not in or the employee seem to be guess when -PRON- will come back
-PRON- suggest that unless -PRON- must come to this place out of necessity skip -PRON-
not worth the attitude -PRON- receive when patronize -PRON- store
if -PRON- be look for a place that serve beer wine and cocktail but do nothing special then this be -PRON- spot
after drive past the location for many month -PRON- be very excited to give -PRON- a try
-PRON- take about 10 minute to be acknowledge by the bartender only one bartender on a friday night
the drink be reasonably price the atmosphere be mediocre but the decor\/couch be a nice surprise
if -PRON- just want a beverage stop in but do not expect much more
have be on the hunt for a crunchy tender fry chicken
this place take the prize sample over 50 + different establishment
-PRON- proudly boast peanut oil be use in the fryer which have a high flash point mean the crispier fry chicken seal in the natural juice
not like kfc which use a pressure cooker to push the oil into the meat
peanut oil tend to be more costly than other fry oil
the only reason -PRON- find this place be drive down to charleston and want to find a place where the local go
when a hole in the wall shack and see a line of local out the door and around the block in a run down neighborhood
-PRON- know -PRON- have to be special
if -PRON- love hush puppy like -PRON- ex fiancee this be the place to go as well
only if -PRON- stick around long enough for -PRON- to take -PRON-
lol
good auction in town
-PRON- stand by the product and always give -PRON- a great deal
-PRON- first review
this place be too amazing to not say anything
great customer service
-PRON- drink be guarantee
-PRON- make -PRON- as sweet as -PRON- like
and the tea amaaaz
-PRON- taste each tea profile with every drink
-PRON- be very impressed
the tea latte have sea salt cream which be absolutely amazing
oolong latte jasmine latte okinawa milk tea be -PRON- faf

mango slush and honey milk tea be bomb as well
seriously so excited that this place exist
-PRON- be hard to not go every day
lol
next on -PRON- list be to try the coffee with sea salt
-PRON- hear -PRON- be also amazing

give this place a 1 star only because -PRON- can not choose 0 star
-PRON- go here because of the review expect an at least good if not great meal
what -PRON- receive be crap
besides the hair in -PRON- food the meat be dry and the rice be artificial tasting
besides the horrible food the price be way too over price
-PRON- literally just shit -PRON- $ 29 dollar out
-PRON- would definitely not recommend
order the steak diane and shrimp scampi follow by tiramisu cheesecake for desert
-PRON- friend tell -PRON- that -PRON- be not as good as other cheesecake factory
but -PRON- think -PRON- be just as good
maybe do not go there during rush hour because -PRON- still take 40 minute to get a table at 1:40
otherwise delicious
-PRON- be thrilled when -PRON- find an inexpensive sushi restaurant in north scottsdale
but every return trip keep get bad
the sushi be subpar the ambiance be ruin by the blare music fruit fly be always present and the service be incredibly slow
-PRON- trip tonight also feature no refill of -PRON- water for the hour -PRON- be there saki that take 20 minute to arrive be cold and obviously water down plus the add distraction of listen to the hostess loudly argue with local law enforcement
-PRON- will not be return and -PRON- caution everyone read this to find someplace else to dine
-PRON- will know this be the place -PRON- warn -PRON- about when -PRON- see the staff member out front chain smoking
a friend recommend nli to -PRON- and -PRON- be so glad -PRON- do
book -PRON- appointment be easy and -PRON- get a follow up text and phone call to confirm
-PRON- have -PRON- first treatment of laser hair removal on the bikini area yesterday and -PRON- be a great experience
-PRON- be greet by two friendly girl at the front desk and quickly after fill out -PRON- new patient paper work -PRON- be take to the back
the technician be very thorough in explain the process and help calm -PRON- nerve about the possibility of pain
once -PRON- start -PRON- continue to chat with -PRON- and be very sweet
any kind of work on the bikini area can be awkward and a little weird but -PRON- make -PRON- feel at ease
-PRON- be pleasantly surprised to find that the pain be very minimal
-PRON- feel like a little slap and even today -PRON- be not in any pain
-PRON- check out and be ask if -PRON- want to schedule -PRON- next appointment
-PRON- say -PRON- would give -PRON- a call after look at -PRON- schedule and that be -PRON-
no pressure no package sale pitch none of that
the whole process be quick friendly and not nearly as scary as -PRON- think -PRON- may be
-PRON- be also a lot less expensive than -PRON- expect
wax over the long term be more expensive and horribly painful
no thank
-PRON- will definitely be back for many more service
-PRON- have eat at china grill several time
-PRON- always enjoy the food and service
the food be modern chinese with a flare
the portion be perfect and the flavor be wonderful
-PRON- always get the steak dish with the onion ring -PRON- forget the name of the dish
-PRON- would highly recommend if -PRON- be in the vegas area
food be pricey but worth -PRON-
the bathroom be also pretty cool
boba here be fine but unfortunately the food take 36 minute to come out and be barely even warm
-PRON- order a beef and broccoli dish and -PRON- taste strongly of fish
food be a step below what -PRON- would feed -PRON- dog
probably not come back
-PRON- husband be crave thai food
so -PRON- find this place on yelp and have to give -PRON- a try for dinner
-PRON- be more like 3.5 star service
5 star the gentleman who wait on -PRON- be attentive and super friendly food
3 star vegetarian egg roll have too much vermicelli noodle and not enough veggie
bland
chicken panang curry-
very authentic tasting
but -PRON- seem too watery and itneed to be thick pad kee mao good amount of veggie and very flavorful
-PRON- like this dish the good
spiced green bean with chicken initially -PRON- mess up the order
-PRON- tell -PRON- absolutely no spice because the kid be go to eat -PRON-
maybe a misunderstanding
anyways -PRON- be really nice and remade the dish without any spice and -PRON- still taste wonderful
-PRON- be locate in a strip mall and lot of free parking
-PRON-
sad to write
this--
three year ago -PRON- would have give -PRON- nails five star
the manager\/owner be very welcoming and despite the crowd -PRON- never have to wait more than 15 min
for a walk in appointment
the owner\/manager would even step in on occasion and start -PRON- mani until someone be free
the tech be all friendly and pay close attention to -PRON- requests-- -PRON- never experience the dread crooked nail syndrome -PRON- would suffer at other place
the gel mani be carefully apply and always last more than a month
-PRON- become a regular as a result never feel the need to request someone specific as the work be uniformly very good
last year -PRON- notice business have drop off sharply
-PRON- do not understand why as -PRON- be still get good to great service
then last year one of -PRON- manis start peel after 10 day or so
the manager offer a free redo which turn out better but the friendliness -PRON- would always experience have cool off somewhat
-PRON- still remain loyal though -PRON- subsequent manicure be not hold up as -PRON- have in the past
-PRON- last visit two week ago be the breaking point
-PRON- be give a new guy henry who be hard to understand
still -PRON- be upbeat and promise a long last mani
-PRON- work very fast and tell -PRON- to put both hand in the dryer which -PRON- would never be tell to do before
-PRON- burn -PRON- hand twice and indicate this but -PRON- seem to not understand -PRON- and keep insist -PRON- follow -PRON- order
-PRON- put on multiple coat so at least -PRON- expect to get -PRON- money 's worth
then come the bill
the price have suddenly go up $ 20.00 to $ 55.00
there be no notice of the price increase anywhere
-PRON- try to complain but henry attempt to tell -PRON- -PRON- be because of a new gel -PRON- be use
-PRON- try to speak with the manager\/owner but -PRON- suddenly have to make a phone call and do not even look -PRON- way when -PRON- try to get -PRON- attention
to add insult to injury when -PRON- ask henry to break a $ 10 -PRON- take -PRON- all smile think -PRON- be -PRON- tip
-PRON- comprehension suddenly go from 50 to zilch
oh and the long last mani -PRON- promise -PRON- start to peel away from the nail bed after only 3 day
-PRON- be force to remove -PRON- after just one week
-PRON- be normally loyal to a fault and can forgive most mishap but after this experience nothing short of new ownership\/management will get -PRON- to step foot in this place again
pretty good pizza but pretty skimpy on the sauce
and the spice be on top of topping and should have be on or in sauce
skimpy on cheese also
last week -PRON- meet a couple friend here to try a new place
-PRON- would start by say that -PRON- food be very delicious
slow home cook flavourful dish that really have great taste
honestly -PRON- would probably give this place a 5\/5 if -PRON- be not for one really weird thing
the owner\/operator be kind of scold -PRON- waitress to clean -PRON- table quicker take -PRON- menu away remove -PRON- dish and -PRON- be pretty awkward
-PRON- really seem upset with -PRON- over nothing and -PRON- be do a fine job
-PRON- do not know
-PRON- just do not sit right with -PRON-
the waitress have be very pleasant all night
and -PRON- be really condescend to -PRON-
so yeah 4\/5 star
-PRON- should not do that kind of stuff in front of -PRON- guests\/ patron
great food but owner may be a slight douchebag
the go to all -PRON- can sushi place in vegas
after -PRON- husband introduce -PRON- to this place -PRON- have be a fan ever since
for a while -PRON- would double date with another couple and the sushi chef start recognize -PRON- and would send over off the menu creation that be delish
everyone who work here be really nice
if -PRON- go on certain day of the week -PRON- be all -PRON- can eat sushi and also all -PRON- can drink beer or sake
fast dirty cheap chinese food | limited parking | free newspaper | thai\/ hakka\/chinese small place at hwy 7\/ markham rd off on the north side
serve a variety of chinese food combo available just like -PRON- typical hk cafe
-PRON- be okay chinese food if -PRON- be just look for a quick fix but be in the markham area there be a ton other place nearby with good quality at the same price
the floor be dirty and greasy
-PRON- soup noodle bowl be plat and when -PRON- remove the bowl -PRON- see a pubic hair like curly hair on -PRON-
-PRON- hope -PRON- be just someone with short curly hair in the kitchen
also when -PRON- come into the restaurant the server give -PRON- a long odd stare
overall the food be not amazing
nothing special
-PRON- be okay
-PRON- would not purposely come back for anything
have an amazing dinner here
stay at the rio and wander in for dinner not know what to expect
waiter be very helpful in order
-PRON- split the caesar salad delicious except -PRON- ask for anchovy and -PRON- be not frsh most likely can and the fry mozzerella and -PRON- be awesome
the fry mozzerella brick have a spicy tomato sauce which be to die for
entree be rigatoni with pork which be great
but -PRON- be stuff by then
good meal -PRON- have in vegas
a little loud in the din room but worth -PRON- for the great dinner
would go back
delicious
this be one of the very few place that serve shabu shabu in montreal
as much as -PRON- anticipate to have some nice japanese hot pot in a still cold march this place be not what -PRON- have expect -PRON- to be
-PRON- be on a sunday night when -PRON- go to dine in this restaurant with around only 6 people currently eat around the round table of hot pot exclude -PRON- and -PRON- friend
as -PRON- turn out to be selection be very limited as there be only 3 flavor for the broth and only two dipping sauce soy sauce and peanut butter sauce
the dipping sauce be underwhelming as -PRON- do not mesh with the veggies\/meat fairly well
-PRON- order the spicy broth as people state that -PRON- be more flavorful while -PRON- friend order the chicken broth
-PRON- find that the spicy broth be also bland along with the chicken broth
the broth only have pepper powder mix so -PRON- taste similar to that
on top of the burn to such a delicate japanese style meal service be very slow -PRON- take -PRON- over 20 minute to bring a cold pot of broth to -PRON- and -PRON- have to wait an extra 5 minute for -PRON- to be heated
the meat slice be way too thin for -PRON- to enjoy such delicacy either
if this place want a second chance -PRON- would be anticipate for a variety of broth and dipping sauce and fast service consider that there be only 6 people dining and -PRON- take -PRON- that long to give -PRON- the meal
+ 1 star because -PRON- get mango ice cream for free
great pie.perfect balance of dough
sauce and cheese .noth
overpower one another
-PRON- cancel a steakhouse dinner and want to find something a mlittle different and a cut above
on the advice of a friend -PRON- end up here where nicola owner and son of the late owner vincente run the place with -PRON- staff
-PRON- be a small busy shop where the staff know -PRON- meat and will answer all -PRON- question
-PRON- get two grass feed wellington county rib eye that be incredible among the good steak -PRON- have eat for flavor and marbling
-PRON- also pick two mennonite farm raise chicken leg which -PRON- grill the following day
again incredible flavor unlike any chicken -PRON- would have at -PRON- typical supermarket remind -PRON- of the chicken -PRON- would eat when -PRON- be a kid
nicola and -PRON- strike a conversation in italian over -PRON- root and mine the merit of italian vs canadian beef and pork and -PRON- all feel like -PRON- have be transport back to a little italy martin scorsese scene in a bygone era where neighborhood be define by the local artisan and merchant that crowd the street
-PRON- will be back to try -PRON- acclaim sausage and more of -PRON- amazing beef and chicken
still -PRON- favorite spot -PRON- love there beer and fish taco
there mocajete be bomb too
a nice break from -PRON- usual starbucks tim horton 's or second cup
great seating indoor and on the patio with lovely decor
the staff be great
three star for the customer service
definitely stop in for a cup or a cookie if -PRON- be in downtown
-PRON- order takeout from here several time now and -PRON- be very consistent with the quality
-PRON- know what -PRON- be get
-PRON- usually get the pad thai brisket and chicken rice
-PRON- have also have the mango salad which be very nice
the mango be a little too hard though so -PRON- do not get -PRON- again
-PRON- prefer -PRON- a bit riper
overall -PRON- really enjoy the flavour of thai cuisine and although some dish be very spicy -PRON- do not mind that
the portion be a good size for sharing in a group and the delivery be fast
a great place to grab a quick bite once in a while
-PRON- think -PRON- be great and pretty convenient fast service price be not bad
nothing fancy but great for take out or lunch with coworker
der geschmack war gut der preis doch für die übersichtliche portion mit 4,50euro für einen döner
eher be oberen preisende
das fleisch war sehr dick geschnitten die einen mögen das die anderen nicht
ich bevorzuge lieber dünner geschnittene fleisch
geschmack des fleisch
ok soße und gemüse ebenso
stimmung in dem laden war nicht besondere
fließband abfertigung alles in allem ein guter dönerladen der seinem kultfaktor nicht gerecht wurde
beim gemüse brot gibt
es mein meinung nach deutlich attraktivere
türken in der umgebung
-PRON- order the squaw peak bennie
description
blue corn biscuit top with grill chorizo avocado tomato and two poach egg cover in adobo hollandaise
the biscuit be dry and taste stale
-PRON- think -PRON- be make of stale scone mix
the egg be slightly overdo
-PRON- really can not get slice avocado and tomato wrong
here be the kicker
if -PRON- gona do a bennie -PRON- must get the hollandaise right
in this category -PRON- have to give -PRON- an epic fail
let -PRON- look past the fact that there be no trace of adobo flavor in the sauce and concentrate on the sauce
-PRON- be self
all -PRON- taste be butter and salt
no lemon or pepper at all
maybe -PRON- be a snob but if -PRON- do a benedict do -PRON- right
good service and reasonably price
-PRON- really enjoy -PRON- meal this evening
-PRON- order three different noodle dish pumpkin curry satay appetizer and pot sticker appetizer
-PRON- waiter be knowledgable of item on the menu be able to recommend dish base on what -PRON- like
food come quickly and be serve with a smile
-PRON- drink be refill regularly and need be readily meet
if -PRON- live in the area this would be a regular place to eat for -PRON- family
first of all the place be amazing
-PRON- have that old time charm and warmth that only come from a place that have be well love and maintain over many year
the staff be very friendly if a little brisk
-PRON- be willing to help -PRON- make a decision but really just get whatev -PRON- have on special that day because -PRON- sure to be delicious
the inside be a little maze like but -PRON- easy to figure out once -PRON- look around once or twice
the main entrance door be next to the road near the river
-PRON- have an awning and few step up to the door
there be a back entrance but that make find the line rather confusing
however if -PRON- be in a wheelchair use the back door because -PRON- more accessible
be warn the table be rather close together so -PRON- may be a little tricky to navigate
-PRON- family of 5 go here at around 4 p.m. on a saturday
there be a line back by the bar but that be par for the course
the line move super fast due to the competent and efficient staff behind the cafeteria style counter
-PRON- end up all get the chicken paprikash mac n cheese and pierogis
-PRON- also share one piece of lemon and one piece of apple pie
all of -PRON- be absolutely divine
-PRON- try chicken paprikash every chance -PRON- get from every restaurant -PRON- can
and this place hit the ball out of the park
by far the good polish food -PRON- have ever taste
-PRON- think a lot of the charm and quality come from the owner -PRON-
-PRON- see -PRON- as -PRON- be eat
-PRON- seem to be a constant in the kitchen and out front
-PRON- snowflake pant and croc convince -PRON- -PRON- be in fact a true chef\/cook
-PRON- have never see a cook in pajama pant who do not know -PRON- way around a kitchen
seriously watch no reservations
and -PRON- will know what -PRON- be talk about
but really -PRON- seem like a great down to earth guy and -PRON- food be out of this world
this be rough
-PRON- take over twenty minute from the time -PRON- tell the first employee one sweet pork salad to the time -PRON- eat
food be prepare nice but be cold after -PRON- sit on the metal prep slide for 15 minute
seriously -PRON- take that long
-PRON- be such a laugh
good choice
-clam chowd -salad bar -ice cream station
everything else be mediocre and really do not go for second on anything
-PRON- be worth the 10 dollar because -PRON- be so cheap and in the morning -PRON- be cheap
-PRON- dad think -PRON- be okay but be sick from the other food selection next day which be produce like slop for pig
literally
not much care put into dish like chicken etc but then again -PRON- be only 10 dollar
in this case -PRON- get what -PRON- pay for
-PRON- would go back but would only eat the salad soup and ice cream
$ 5.50 for a soda
$ 23.00 for mac and cheese
-PRON- kill -PRON- to pay this bill because the food be godawful
seriously this be the kind of food that leave -PRON- queasy afterwards
-PRON- also have the fish taco which consist of rubbery fish no seasoning and some tortilla chip throw on the plate
disgusting
-PRON- have eat good food at applebee 's
-PRON- can not believe this restaurant be part of the bellagio
that be the big waste of $ 75.00 ever

-PRON- go to las vegas on business and have be plenty of time before
so i be familiar with the caliber and price of all the different hotel on the strip
this one be book for -PRON- as a colleague have a time share so apparantly -PRON- get a good deal
firstly when check in the say after give -PRON- the key to go to the next lady for -PRON- welcome pak
-PRON- version of a welcome pack be an attempt to sign -PRON- up for a timeshare
after say no no no -PRON- continue to call -PRON- room that day to increase the offer show ticket etc to go into a presentation
-PRON- have be to presentation before and i know how high pressure -PRON- be
-PRON- say 2 hour but really -PRON- be 4 hours+
secondly -PRON- say the room have a murphy bed and a bed the studio suite
the room be the size of -PRON- bedroom at home
there be a murphy bed and a hide a bed couch
but the room be so small -PRON- can not be open at the same time
-PRON- try to speak to the front desk about the problem and the good -PRON- could do be upgrade to a 1 bedroom suite for an extra $ 30\/night
that would make -PRON- around $ 70\/nt total and for that price there be many option way good than this aging have be hotel
no restaurant
no casino
no return from -PRON-
-PRON- live the boneless chicken
here and how there be a layer of hot sauce right under the breaded part of the chicken
-PRON- still dip -PRON- in hot sauce and ranch
but -PRON- like the extra cajun flavoring
this be literally -PRON- favorite food from here
the drive through be kind of a pain to get too but the wait be not too bad
this downtown local keep -PRON- around the corner feel instead of get catch up in the hustle and bustle of the big city
friendly service and a huge bar be great for hang out with friend or meetup before and after just about any toronto game
-PRON- favourite aspect of jack astor 's be the drink
the food be ok but -PRON- drink out do -PRON-
when -PRON- finally realize that the place brew and bottle -PRON- own rootbeer -PRON- be hooked
deliciously smooth and much good than a w -PRON- truly appreciate the option of a brew non alcholic beverage for the sober vegetarian in -PRON-
come here with two of -PRON- coworker for lunch today
-PRON- get there a few minute after -PRON- open so the wait time be not bad at all
near the end -PRON- do get rather busy
so -PRON- suggest the early the good
-PRON- waitress be great
very nice and informative even convince -PRON- to try to margaritas
-PRON- get the coconut margaritas and -PRON- other coworker get a prickly pear
-PRON- be nice and smooth great taste
the prickly pear be a bit too sweet for -PRON- liking but still really good
-PRON- both agree that -PRON- be not strong at all
-PRON- usually feel a bit fuzzy after one margarita and these do not do that to -PRON-
still really good though
food come out rather fast
again this may be because -PRON- get there pretty early before the rush
everything look great
-PRON- get 3 of -PRON- street taco
one standard one carne asada and one pork
-PRON- all have amazing taste to -PRON-
can not really decide which one -PRON- like more
the waitress do forgot -PRON- salsa but -PRON- be not a big deal because honestly the taco do not need -PRON- at all
the ambiance be nice and casual
-PRON- would love to see this place at night
have to be so pretty
-PRON- be a bit more on the trendy hipster side of thing but -PRON- fit well all together
will definitely consider come back again
maybe next time at night
oh and postino be right next door
score
despite some pretty bad review -PRON- think -PRON- would give -PRON- a try
-PRON- have a good experience
from order to food delivery -PRON- be about 15 20 min
the fry be really good
have the sweet potato and garlic parm fry
the burger be good
-PRON- only offer -PRON- in medium or well do
-PRON- order medium but the meat be much close to the medium well spectrum
the burger have great taste though and -PRON- get really good service
the only thing really keep this place from 5 star be the fly
there be quite a few of -PRON- fly around the inside
other then that -PRON- will be back again
-PRON- hope -PRON- keep refine -PRON- process and work out the kink
anthem need more diversity in the way of food
come here with family and have a great breakfast
-PRON- order french toast pancake waffle a tuna sandwich and everything be great
come with an empty stomach because -PRON- give big portion
-PRON- have kabanos kielbasa and all sort of great deli meat
-PRON- also carry assorted european food in jar
-PRON- sandwich be delicious though -PRON- should know that a half be two full slice and a whole be just two sandwich
why
-PRON- do not know
the only only complaint -PRON- have be -PRON- be a cash only place
and -PRON- do not carry cash
still -PRON- be often worth stop by an atm on the way
-PRON- have get to try this place
period
when -PRON- wife and -PRON- be look for a place to have lunch last saturday -PRON- look up what be local and recommend on yelp
this place come up and -PRON- confess -PRON- make all manner of joke about the name the concept of mexican food and sushi together that there be only a handful of review post
even when -PRON- wife and -PRON- pull up to the restaurant -PRON- see the pic on the front and want to leave -PRON- look like a mexican restaurant try a gimmick of sushi
shame on -PRON-
-PRON- be happy to report that -PRON- do decide to at least go inside and order one thing
good idea -PRON- have have in awhile
-PRON- can only assume this be a family run place because everyone there be incredibly nice and outgoing
turn out -PRON- be run a charity even that day for a local police group which be awesome by -PRON-
but -PRON- be a foodie and this be a restaurant review the food be incredible
-PRON- have no idea what -PRON- be get into
-PRON- do not even know mexican sushi be a thing
-PRON- think this place be go to service mexican and japanese food
no -PRON- serve a complete fusion of the two
the sushi be mexican version of everything
-PRON- make all -PRON- sauce and the result be absolutely amazing
-PRON- wife do not like cream cheese so -PRON- quickly offer to make -PRON- roll without -PRON-
-PRON- start with one roll -PRON- be just order one thing after all and -PRON- be absolutely amazing
-PRON- can not tell -PRON- the name but -PRON- have shrimp and cheese on top and yes that should not ever go together
ignore what -PRON- know about food this be just delicious
the second roll -PRON- get have beef and asparagus in -PRON-
-PRON- do not like the asparagus but the overall flavor be excellent
-PRON- have get to try this place -PRON- will be glad -PRON- do

this restaurant be attach to the mall
outside appearance and the menu look fabulous
hostesses sit -PRON- at an outdoor table and be even accommodate about not seat -PRON- in the sun
-PRON- be then greet by a server who bring -PRON- silverware
-PRON- dad ask what the soup of the day be and -PRON- hem and haw for a moment then say -PRON- do not know because -PRON- be in training but -PRON- would check and be right back
-PRON- never see -PRON- again
another server come by and take -PRON- drink order
-PRON- order water and order a white wine
-PRON- ask again about the soup of the day mention on two different menu but -PRON- let -PRON- know about the two soup that be already list on the menu tortilla and clam chowder
so no soup of the day then
guess not
ten minute later -PRON- come back and tell -PRON- -PRON- be out of that wine
-PRON- then ask for the rosè which -PRON- say -PRON- be also out of
that be unacceptable to -PRON- when -PRON- only have 5 7 white wine by the glass

-PRON- cancel all wine order at that point as -PRON- be get annoying

so thank for make an attempt to make -PRON- experience better
so sad to say that this morning on npr -PRON- hear this fabulous museum will close on sunday 10.17.10 noooo
one word-- wow
-PRON- can not even remember the last time -PRON- have food this impeccable
-PRON- fiancé and -PRON- come here for a pre theatre dinner and be blow away
the majority of the seating here be at a counter where -PRON- can watch the chef prepare the food
-PRON- seat be directly in front of the chef who plat the food and -PRON- literally could not tear -PRON- eye away from -PRON-
-PRON- take such time and care in plat the food that -PRON- know -PRON- be in for a treat before -PRON- even taste anything
-PRON- order off the pre theatre menu $ 58 which consist of an amuse bouche an appetizer and the roast of the day
-PRON- also order drink
-PRON- have a pear cocktail which be amazing and -PRON- fiancé have the strawberry cocktail which -PRON- enjoy as well
but -PRON- both like -PRON- better since -PRON- be a little more unusual
before -PRON- come to the restaurant -PRON- be tell -PRON- fiancé that the last thing -PRON- would want for the amuse bouche be foie gra which -PRON- detest
lo and behold foie gra -PRON- be and -PRON- be happy and surprised to say that -PRON- absolutely love -PRON-
the amuse bouche of foie gra with port wine and parmesean foam may have be -PRON- favorite bite of the whole meal
thanks l'atelier for make -PRON- a foie gra lover for now
for the appetizer -PRON- choose the gazpacho and -PRON- fiance decide on the carbonara
both be spectacular
the gazpacho have burrata cheese in the middle-- an unexpected creamy surprise with spectacular result
the carbonara be amazingly unctuous and flavorful
the main course be the roast of the day which in -PRON- case be chicken
roast chicken do not sound too exciting but at l'atelier roast chicken have as much class and taste as caviar and lobster nearly anywhere else
the chicken be top with an onion compote and be accompany by asparagus a small frisee and herb salad with truffle vinaigrette and the most decadent mash potato -PRON- will ever taste
the chicken be perfectly moist and the mash potato literally have the consistency of butter
-PRON- say that any good chef can prepare expensive ingredient well the mark of an amazing chef be one who can turn something ordinary like roast chicken into something extraordinary
l'atelier definitely accomplish the latter
also as many have say the bread here be out of this world and -PRON- be happy to replenish -PRON- as often as -PRON- would like
the pre theatre menu do not come with dessert so -PRON- order one a la carte to share
-PRON- opt for the chartreuse souffle with homemade pistachio ice cream
perfectly flavor with just the right amount of sweetness
the souffle have a dreamy silky pillowy texture that melt in -PRON- mouth
spectacular
as expect the service here be impeccable
-PRON- could not have ask for a good experience
the pre theatre menu here be an amazing deal-- very reasonable and worth -PRON- price in spade
joel robuchon definitely deserve every single one of -PRON- 33
michelin stars-- the most of any chef in the world one of which belong to l'atelier
while -PRON- be the owner of one of the most expensive restaurant in the world joel robuchon restaurant right next door -PRON- deserve even more accolade in -PRON- book for make incredible food affordable through l'atelier
-PRON- will definitely be back the next time -PRON- be in vegas
organic and health conscious grocer
-PRON- go for the soy and non dairy stuff which -PRON- have a pretty good selection
not fantastic but pretty good
-PRON- can find thing like non dairy cream cheese sour cream ice cream so(y
delicious ice cream amy 's frozen food etc
-PRON- just irk -PRON- that -PRON- be frequently out of the most popular item for these brand
yet -PRON- carry a plethora of other thing that look like -PRON- have not turn over in month
if -PRON- ask any university of edinburgh student who have live in newington where a great takeaway be chilli connection will almost certainly be the answer
-PRON- seem to have go down in folklore as the place to get curry kebab or pizza in that part of town
this reputation be help by the location on south clerk street
this be right on the route most student stay at pollock halls of residence near holyrood park will take home from a night out
-PRON- can quite easily fall into chilli connection and come out minute later with some wholesome takeaway goodness
let -PRON- be honest the food be nothing to write home about
-PRON- be fairly unremarkable takeaway quality food
-PRON- be the location of this place that make -PRON- worthy of four star
have sample one of the -PRON- pizza at some unearthly hour in the morning -PRON- very much hit the spot as anything would have do at the that time
price be reasonable and service be ok
chilli connection be a great default option for any takeaway need -PRON- may have
whilst other may have good quality food -PRON- would be a fool not to check out such a legend
-PRON- could not be happy with this place -PRON- be -PRON- go to while at work in the market
friendly service the staff move quickly to prepare food and that food be delicious
-PRON- frequent the side that sell panini 's which be amazing
the only reason -PRON- do not give this place a 5 star rating be one of the lady at the main location next door have constantly be rude to -PRON- since -PRON- start come there and of course the side -PRON- go to do not have a debit machine
so -PRON- have to interact with -PRON- every time -PRON- forget to bring cash
otherwise -PRON- highly recommend -PRON- food
try the vatican panini very fill for 6 $ and taste awesome
-PRON- come here for brunch on mother 's day and -PRON- be not as pack as most people claim
i arrive at 1:30 and -PRON- friend and i be seat right away
i order the french toast with a side of sausage
the french toast be amazing with the vanilla custard and maple syrup
-PRON- also get a side of sausage and -PRON- come on a patty like serve vs. a typical log sausage
i'm pretty sure -PRON- be home make which make -PRON- even better
so good
i would definitely come back here
but i would say the portion be small than what -PRON- be use to for brunch place
-PRON- finish -PRON- entire plate which be rare
maybe i be just hungry though
most of people who read this review will not remember the day when organize crime run las vegas but -PRON- be there for the end of mob rule
in may of 1946 bugsy siegel alter an agreement with william wilkerson read coerce under threat of death which eventually give siegel and the syndicate control of the flamingo hotel in las vegas
siegel want to provide gambling food drink and entertainment at reasonable price
a business model the mob use until -PRON- die day in vegas not only to attract high roller but middle class vacationer willing to lose small amount of money at -PRON- table
siegel borrow million from the syndicate to get the hotel off the ground and the initial result be a failure which cause siegel to temporarily shut down the flamingo
the hotel would reopen in march of 1947 with meyer lansky present and start show a profit
this be too little too late as far as the syndicate be concern
in 1946 the syndicate meet in havana cuba so an exile charles luciano could attend and the rumor end result be a contract be put out on siegel
siegel have also tell associate -PRON- be run a california syndicate on -PRON- own and -PRON- would repay the loan in -PRON- own time
on june 20 1947 siegel be gun down at the home of -PRON- girlfriend and the crime go unsolved
-PRON- can still remember the first time -PRON- see the strip and the billion of bulb light up the night sky
-PRON- make for a very exhilarating experience
today -PRON- be bath in neon and the feeling just be not the same http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/las vegas strip las vegas-4?select = pk4lqf4tukgdjewir_pqga http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/las vegas strip las vegas-4?select = k3e397andzm0ebmowr_ehg http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/las vegas strip las vegas-4?select = jots9yz0uvmebtt4isp3sw
most of the hotel -PRON- remember from -PRON- first day visit the strip be go but the flamingo http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/las vegas strip las vegas-4?select = zxoh3w4hcqrdainfpmdh q and caesars palace still stand
-PRON- be not say mob rule be good than the corporate model of today but -PRON- be definitely different
if there be a vagrant population -PRON- be hide for the most part but today http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/las vegas strip las vegas-4?select = yy4gicd4wa_ugbje sbw a the homeless be everywhere with the exception of hotel property
in addition to the vagrant the scam artist be out in full force
people peddle timeshare free limousine ride to place the driver be pay to take -PRON- and free show ticket wonder why these show be free
if the mob be still run las vegas anyone try to hustle this stuff would have end up in an alley with a columbian necktie for -PRON- trouble
when -PRON- first walk the strip the only peddle -PRON- see involve strip club and prostitution which be control by the mob
another notable difference be the employee
criticize the mob all -PRON- want but -PRON- take care of -PRON- employee
good wage health care and retirement plan be available for all hotel and casino employee
the result be practically every worker -PRON- meet have a smile on -PRON- face and friendly personality
in the corporate vegas these smile and friendly worker be far few
if -PRON- be at a table or a one armed bandit in -PRON- early day when -PRON- drink be empty there be always a waitress ask if -PRON- need another
the drink be also strong splash of coke with -PRON- rum
the drink -PRON- have during this trip be either nicely balance or void of alcohol and the server few and far between for the most part
another huge difference be the uniform
the mob understand sex sell and if -PRON- be the toga wear girl at caesars or the low cut blouse and high skirt at the barbary coast r. i. p. there be plenty of eye candy for the guy
rohlinism give a man a free drink and -PRON- will stay until -PRON- be finish
give a man a drink in a low cut blouse and -PRON- will stay until -PRON- pass out
the uniform today be pretty nondescript the cream color one piece at caesars need a particular figure to pull off and most of the woman wear -PRON- lack say figure
not to mention the short cape remind -PRON- of elvis circa 1970 's
bleh
the corporate vegas have improve the hotel and food but the mob want all -PRON- money at the table so -PRON- would have never contract a gordon ramsay or wolfgang puck to open a restaurant in -PRON- hotel
-PRON- give -PRON- a $ 1.99 steak and egg breakfast so -PRON- could cheaply sustain -PRON- and return to the casino
the mob do not make hotel room fancy because if -PRON- be in -PRON- room -PRON- be not in the casino give -PRON- -PRON- money
-PRON- wife recently stay at the venetian and feel obligate to spend time in the room because -PRON- be so nice and sooooooo expensive
for other the corporate vegas may be a splendid thing but -PRON- find -PRON- longing for the day when the mob run the town
-PRON- go here at least once a week for lunch here
awesome staff
great prices
the teppanyaki style grill be way good than benihana restaurant for sure
the chefs be funny and -PRON- be easy to enjoy -PRON- meal without be in the big casino atmosphere and have to hassle with all the noise people and parking
the food be amazing and all the servers be so pleasant and helpful
cindy be usually -PRON- server and -PRON- rock this place
love this sushi restaurant and highly recommend at least try -PRON- once -PRON- will be hooked for sure
excellent service
excellent food
have one of the omelette for brunch
extra tasty and mega portion
-PRON- have a hard time decide on how many star to give cuz -PRON- family friend -PRON- love the pizza from here
-PRON- dilemma come from the customer service
-PRON- work very close by on most occasion someone else pick up the order
some of the young people that have go to get -PRON- order always say the customer service be horrible
-PRON- have a feeling -PRON- may be because -PRON- be not tip to the staff like
however like a previous reviewer state the wait time can be out of control
-PRON- have call an hour 40 min ahead of time for 1 of the 36 pizza which -PRON- get a lot
-PRON- usually get 4 different quarter on the pizza
the last time -PRON- be all wrong the pick up person wait an additional 25 min for the pizza
-PRON- will still get pizza for home on occasion but
where -PRON- work well everyone refuse to go pick up -PRON- order
-PRON- be recently in vegas to visit relatives\/visit vegas
-PRON- decide to stay in the new york new york hotel as -PRON- be decently price and seem to be in the middle of the strip
this be -PRON- first time in vegas and -PRON- be travel with a two year old
anyway now that -PRON- have some background let get to the review room
although -PRON- choose the cheap room -PRON- be perfectly sized nice decor and great view
-PRON- be on the 31st floor and face southeast above the roller coaster
when -PRON- take -PRON- first look out the window and notice the roller coaster -PRON- think how loud be this thing go to be
-PRON- be not loud at all
and -PRON- really enjoy see the rider scream -PRON- head off without hear -PRON-
entertainment
-PRON- have a baby sitter for the nigh
so -PRON- and the wife take in a show zoomanity
-PRON- be very entertaining -PRON- like that -PRON- be perform in the hotel
so -PRON- do not have to go far
if -PRON- be easily offend or be not into adult entertainment this be not the show for -PRON-
-PRON- be a bit pricey
but -PRON- be glad -PRON- see -PRON-
-PRON- could go on and on but to summarize
this be a really nice place for a fair price
centrally locate on the strip and have everything -PRON- want and need within walking distance for a satisfy vegas trip
-PRON- only complaint about the room there be a faint stale cigaret smell notice when -PRON- first enter the room
-PRON- do not overwhelm and seem to fade pretty quickly
secondly the room be like a meat locker and when -PRON- adjust the thermostat -PRON- feel more comfortable standing in the nevada desert
-PRON- adjust -PRON- back pull the cover over -PRON- head and enjoy a couple day in vegas at the great new york new york hotel
food be good
-PRON- do take out from there a lot
enjoy the gyro platter with the lemon flavor rice
the saganaki be a bit of a disapointment and over price but the calamari be excellent and great value for the price
the chocolate cake be tasty but again a bit high price
la petite terrasse était attirante au premier regard
mai la désillusion qui allait suivre n'en était que plus forte
pour commencer service de mauvaise qualité serveuse froide non souriante et erreur lor de la prise de commande soit
passon
ce qu'on demande à un resto c' surtout une bonne cuisine
et là c' le jackpot monsieur
dame
les frite étaient surcuite quasiment grillées les crevette pannées sont composées
à moitié de friture
et la salade avait un gout de plastique et pour finir les prix sont absolument exhorbirtant
une escroquerie à eviter
great customer service on time and fix -PRON- ice maker same day
thank -PRON-
very happy with this company would use -PRON- again
every once in a great while -PRON- be blow away by an experience
-PRON- wife 's recent birthday dinner be one such night
the key to -PRON- all be reserve a little room off to the side of this pittsburgh institution call quite simply the q 's
-PRON- be a small private dining room with a fire place sit area and table
-PRON- seat up to 16 people but be exceptional for a party of 6 8
the food be divine and the service and care extremely attentive
-PRON- spend what feel like a 4 hour vacation nestle in a rustic cabin in the wood
a remarkable evening
but be warn
-PRON- need to come in with the right mindset
-PRON- be a quaint little room that be rather drafty and even a little smokey from the fire also -PRON- must go outside and into the main restaurant to use the restroom
but if -PRON- be up for a quiet romantic dinner party with -PRON- close friend -PRON- can think of no place better in pittsburgh
dr. thompson be straightforward and trustworthy
-PRON- be get a gentle touch and personally caring demeanor
a must stop whenever -PRON- be in vegas
new discovery crunchy beef jerky and chocolate cover sunflower seed
-PRON- friend who live in town have -PRON- over for dinner and -PRON- frequent the beef jerky store and always buy alot of different item so -PRON- be able to try -PRON-
already finish -PRON- bag of li hing mui so will see if -PRON- can send -PRON- some
-PRON- be like high class fancy street food
lol
if that make any sense
the plating\/ presentation be beautiful
the food taste good
a little more more than -PRON- want to spend
but -PRON- would come back
one of -PRON- favorite place in vegas .food be delicious
the service be fast and wonderful
-PRON- highly recommend come here for the good sushi and cocktail
when -PRON- be look for a bakery -PRON- be typically look for morning offering not dessert offering
anything in the dessert arena be ice on the cake but -PRON- really want donut pastry muffin bagel etc
with this criterion in mind -PRON- have never be to a good bakery than oakmont bakery
-PRON- be a pittsburgher bear breed but -PRON- have be live in virginia for almost two decade
whenever -PRON- come back into town -PRON- stop in at the oakmont bakery without fail
the donut selection rival what -PRON- would see at a national chain the pastry range from the basic to the bizarre in a good way and the few dessert -PRON- have be able to try thus far cupcake cookie have be top notch
if -PRON- be swing through the oakmont area be sure to stop in
on weekend morning however there may be a line
do not worry -PRON- move fast
after all who would not want some of these fine treat
-PRON- advertise free delivery and pickup however -PRON- be not free there be a $ 2 charge which -PRON- tell -PRON- if -PRON- can reach -PRON-
-PRON- be also not very customer friendly
very pleased with corwin pool
-PRON- be have issue at -PRON- mom house
competitor not show up regularly or just do poor work
-PRON- do not know about -PRON-
but -PRON- check that log
and corwin be the only one hold up -PRON- end of thing
pool be clean and clear and -PRON- straighten up the equipment too
-PRON- do find -PRON- a bit odd how -PRON- mom now find reason to hang out by the pool in a bikini gross
maybe the pool guy will be -PRON- new dad though
will -PRON- get a family discount then
well morels be recommend by a close friend for a night cap and dessert to end -PRON- birthday adventure
and be not disappoint
the manager mark be super helpful and professional in help recommend some good dessert to end the night with
-PRON- end up go with the classic profiterole and the traditional creme brûlée
not too sweet perfectly homemade dessert dish and a sparkler to boot for -PRON- birthday
-PRON- bartender julie be also very pleasant and knowledgeable
-PRON- try -PRON- infuse bourbon red rider b.b
which be one of the signature drink here and -PRON- be very good just a little heavy with dessert
so -PRON- recommend an aperitief style cocktail with bully bourbon that be amazing
highly recommend restaurant
-PRON- always get the same thing when -PRON- go.this time -PRON- decide to try something different and really glad that -PRON- do
the quesadilla fajita be really good
the service be great food be great atmosphere be good and -PRON- be very clean
the coconut soup be too sweet
pho be good but -PRON- need heat
-PRON- be really stuffy in here
-PRON- need a c or to open the door
-PRON- be sweat when -PRON- leave
that be the food partly of course
-PRON- will have to make another trip to try other dish but do not think -PRON- will be in a hurry to do that
the only reason -PRON- give -PRON- 2 star be because -PRON- actually have good food and drink for a good price
the customer be never consistent
some day have be good and some awful
and the most important part be that mine and 4 of -PRON- friend get -PRON- credit card information steal
everyone in -PRON- party that use a credit\/debit card get -PRON- information steal
allegedly the person who steal -PRON- information be no longer work there
but that be a definite red flag for this establishment
a solid place to get -PRON- caffeine fix
-PRON- have a large variety of bean range from regular roasted to exotically flavor decaf too
the large barrel be easy to scoop -PRON- coffee out of and -PRON- can even combine flavor cinnamon and vanilla be a favorite of mine
-PRON- have grinder on site as well so -PRON- can either take home whole bean or have -PRON- ground in store
-PRON- have a large supply of french press and tumbler available as well
the large selection and reasonable price be why this place get 5\/5
an ayce that be well worth the price
locate off the strip in a strip mall with plenty of parking
nice art work on the wall modern k pop music and wait staff be professional and attentive
staff easily handle a group of eleven without a problem
kept food come clear empty plate refill tea and water
all with a smile
plenty of nigiri choice with a high fish to rice ratio
all the fish that -PRON- have be fresh at lunch on a sunday
one order of sea trout per ayce
diner
-PRON- need to remember to order this one
unagi be nicely bake and a large piece
large volume of cooked dish shrimp tempura udon noodles bacon wrapped scallops who do not like bacon
remember to order dessert
green tea ice cream mochi ice cream panna cotta
a definite place to go for ayce japanese food when in vegas
-PRON- be give the signature at the mgm grand a low star rating because of the poor service
to start off -PRON- request to be in a high floor and -PRON- give -PRON- a suite on the 4th floor when -PRON- get there the tv in the bedroom do not work and there be a loud buzz noise in the living room when -PRON- turn on the light
the towel seem overly used as well
-PRON- change tower the next day but would have cancel the whole reservation if -PRON- could
now on to the valet service
valet have poor service
-PRON- be not there to give -PRON- -PRON- car when -PRON- need -PRON- at 12 a.m. and have to walk because valet be close at the time
last but not least the staff there be so rude and not welcome
the bell man offer poor service as well
-PRON- will never stay at the signature again
-PRON- would recommend stay at the vdara -PRON- have excellent service
-PRON- sell bobbette belle macaron at mcewan 's grocery store shop at don mills and holt renfrew 's gourmet cafe bloor st
-PRON- hear that the macaron arrive fresh at mcewan 's every friday morning so -PRON- go in last week for some
price be $ 2.00 per individual macaron or $ 10.00 for a pretty box of 5 different flavour
the individual selection feature four flavour but the box contain one extra flavour
-PRON- get the box which have mocha passionfruit pistachio lychee and black forest
macarons always taste great fresh and this instance be no exception
the shell be light and crisp and the filling be moist
the exotic fruit flavour be do very well
-PRON- would definitely get these again
if -PRON- go to mcewan 's to try -PRON- make sure -PRON- go between any friday morning and afternoon

1 star be be far to generous in regard to -PRON- customer service
if the cue be not so long that -PRON- disconnect -PRON- immediately when -PRON- call -PRON- service line and that be a big if -PRON- will hear such helpful hint to rectify -PRON- issue such as -it be -PRON- modem -PRON- need a new one

-PRON- be the bad
-PRON- love this second cup location -PRON- be in a cute little house and free parking at the no frill
-PRON- have be go here for year and year but for some reason the staff always look like -PRON- hate -PRON- job\/life

aside from that the coffee\/location be great
enjoy the cute patio in the summer or walk around and check out port credit

-PRON- wish i could comment on the rest of the food
the pizza be so good -PRON- can not seem to try anything else
edit
the pizza here put oregano 's to shame
-PRON- can not believe -PRON- have not review this place before
-PRON- be shocked and disappointed in -PRON-
gelato dolce vita have be a favorite of mine since long ago okay like five or six year
-PRON- live in queen creek and whenever -PRON- go to mesa to visit -PRON- friend -PRON- would inevitably end up here
every flavor be amazing and the owner be super friendly
-PRON- really be the good gelato -PRON- have taste outside of italy
and -PRON- know even some place in italy do not quite measure up
maybe -PRON- be biased
who know
just trust -PRON-
check this place out
that be -PRON- advice
the end
-PRON- take -PRON- good friend here for some much need sustenance
-PRON- be friday night and -PRON- be pack
the wait be about 30 min
edgar the owner totally hook -PRON- up with a booth after only wait for 10 min -PRON- be such a good guy
-PRON- friend and -PRON- decide on the usual favorite and some new thing that -PRON- have not explore yet
but -PRON- be so glad -PRON- do
pan fry dates- pretty much a staple of any barcelona visit beef carpaccio-
the fry scallion and balsamic reduction make this one a winner pork empenadas- kinda heavy for -PRON-
but -PRON- do not think -PRON- be really in the mood for fry food bbq ribs-
-PRON- be impressed
the sauce be flavorful but not overpower the pineapple chunk go well with the sauce and the meat practically fall off the bone
will definitely order that again
spicy shrimp-
this be one of -PRON- favorite new find on the menu
the sauce be sweet and hot think thai chili sauce the shrimp be succulent and -PRON- go great with bread huge plus in -PRON- book
-PRON- friend and -PRON- enjoy -PRON- meal immensely and will be back soon
thank -PRON- edgar
pizza express be one of the few chain restaurant that -PRON- would happily go back to again and again
unusually -PRON- have get the formula of good food at reasonable price in simple surrounding spot on
the pizza express branch in stockbridge be situtat in a beautiful building that look out over the water of leith
if -PRON- be there in the summer then -PRON- be lovely to eat outside on the patio otherwise request the window booth that look straight out over the water
the food serve at pizza express be so good
starter that be light yet enjoyable and pizza that be thin crispy and with just the right amount of topping
the selection of pizza available be excellent with a decent variety for all the choose from
staff in the restaurant be as helpful as can be but -PRON- do get very busy at time so be patient
another entry from -PRON- facebook 's veggie burger chronicle
-PRON- be work on make the 2 this one and -PRON- fb 's identical
please note -PRON- be not rat the restaurant just the burger
vegetarian burger
kfc
-topping
lettuce
-PRON- come standard with mayo but -PRON- can not have mayo so -PRON- have -PRON- with bbq sauce instead
-patty
fry thus crunchy
-PRON- be white and flaky on the inside -price
~$3.66 just the burger before or after tax
-PRON- come up to $ 3.69 at the scarborough location -PRON- visit
the downtown queen street location come up to $ 3.66 after tax
-verdict -PRON- taste like chicken
lol
-PRON- be entirely different from all the other veggie burger that -PRON- have in the past because of the white patty veggie burger be conventionally brown
-PRON- be not impressed that -PRON- come with only shred lettuce and mayo although -PRON- skip the mayo
the patty -PRON- do not taste bad -PRON- be very good actually but -PRON- can not figure out what -PRON- be make of
one good thing about the kfc veggie burger be that -PRON- be virtually unknown though -PRON- be available at most location which mean -PRON- can always count on -PRON- be hot and crispy because -PRON- will make -PRON- fresh for -PRON-
depend on -PRON- patience and hunger this could be a bad thing because -PRON- need to wait 3 4 minute for the burger to cook
for -PRON- meat eater friend and -PRON- vegan\/ vegetarian friend who miss meat neither of -PRON- can go wrong with this choice
try it
go here last week with husband
patio be amazing
one of the good in toronto
-PRON- server be this little spunky asian girl -PRON- be amazing
-PRON- make -PRON- experience great
-PRON- start off with the guac and mojito which be incredible
then -PRON- have the baja fish taco and the shrimp and lobster taco
both amazing
would go back for sure
-PRON- boyfriend and -PRON- buy a rhino from this place
the service after the sale be horrible
the repair guy be no good the rhino be always broken
-PRON- just move here and this place be a couple mile away from -PRON- so -PRON- have to check -PRON- out once -PRON- pup run out of food
pricing be great and the worker who -PRON- believe be
sarah be very helpful
5\/5 star
-PRON- will definitely be come back for more good
-PRON- go here and have a blast after an awful night at a club on the strip
hookah dancing drinking and food all at once
yes please
also lady be free all night be not a bad thing either though the cover for guy after 10 p.m. be pretty steep $ 25
girl actually outnumber guy here on a saturday night
-PRON- have a craving for cajun and find this place via yelp
so -PRON- decide to make the 30-minute drive and check out the hype
friendly staff
food be delicious
price could have be a little bit better
between -PRON- wife daughter -PRON- the bill end up be approximately $ 50 inclusive of tip for a late afternoon lunch
-PRON- have the po boy oyster w\/sweet potato fry
the wife order the oyster platter and small cup of gumbo while -PRON- teen daughter settle for the chicken strip w\/frie
the oyster dish be great and -PRON- be a must order in -PRON- opinion
the side be all prepare well and compliment the meal perfectly
the only reason -PRON- do not give this place 5 star be because of the price
-PRON- think everything -PRON- order be worth the price tag except for the gumbo and chicken strip
$ 5 for a small cup of gumbo and $ 10 for some chicken strip be in -PRON- opinion again a bit too much
everything else be reasonable for the portion size and tasty ness experience
bottom line
-PRON- will be back for second however this can not be a regular place for -PRON- due to the cost
-PRON- be fabulous freddie 's last month get a car wash -PRON- do a great job
the same night -PRON- rain and -PRON- continue throughout the day
the wash get ruin and -PRON- be back at fabulous freddie 's the next day

fabulous
very friendly -PRON- will be back to this location

thank team
pin kaow be in -PRON- area so this be -PRON- main thai spot
-PRON- be pretty good but -PRON- be a little pricy for food that consist mostly of rice and noodle
the decor in here be very pretty and -PRON- be just an overall pleasant place to sit and have dinner
there be some very good dish here
-PRON- love the pad thai and a lot of the appetizer be really good
-PRON- be disappointed with -PRON- sticky rice because -PRON- be hard than usual
-PRON- think -PRON- may have be reheat in the microwave
the service be okay
-PRON- server be not particularly attentive or pleasant but -PRON- be not bad
the main reason -PRON- give -PRON- 3 star be because -PRON- can get thai food that be just as good for less and with just as good service at other place
but if -PRON- be look for a nice pretty place to have decent thai food pin kaow be a good place to go
this new car wash be everything
friendly staff
start of the art equipment
vacuum be free really like this place will only use this place for -PRON- car wash
stop there wednesday at 7:30pm for dinner for 3 of -PRON-
-PRON- ask if -PRON- could have a table in the back and the hostess ask why would -PRON- want that
-PRON- politely reply the front be loud and there be smoke from nearby slot machine player
-PRON- say -PRON- doubt there be a table but pick up 3 menu walk back come back up front and then walk back up to hostess station without give an answer
-PRON- put down the menu and start help a server
-PRON- ask about -PRON- table and -PRON- turn -PRON- back to face completely away from -PRON- and from the restaurant
-PRON- be pretty surprised -PRON- be that rude over a simple request for a table
the three of -PRON- have not see each other for 6 month and be hop for a quieter spot to talk
well all american grill be now a place -PRON- will encourage all 107,000 come to the wsop to stay away from when get food at the rio
-PRON- so rude and no -PRON- be not a house to home employee and -PRON- post be from january why be -PRON- reply now
-PRON- be sorry to hear -PRON- close down -PRON- do a great job on -PRON- flooring
look like a lot people more recently than -PRON- have yelped about -PRON- poor service
do not respond to -PRON- about something that happen 8 month aog or i will continue to give -PRON- 1 star
-PRON- go to giada
meh the appetizer be flat out bad
-PRON- have the eggplant and meatball
the eggplant be simple a roasted piece of eggplant that be not particuallary good with a dab of flavorless tomato paste
entree 's be meh
-PRON- have the homemade shrimp and pasta which be good not great but for $ 34
-PRON- would expect more than 1 oz of pasta and 2 shrimp
very very very dissapointing
be in this line for 20 minute to
check out
wow super snail service
why
the check out woman be so so so massively sweet and kind-
in fact -PRON- love -PRON-
good thing -PRON- be in constant practice of the human condition of patience other wise this would be the lame experience
this woman have coupon in front of -PRON- be the deal
why be there
not a coupon fucking check out lane
and then a mother pick up child from school lane
walmart wake up
errrrrr
-PRON- beloved pair of new balances be basically fall apart and -PRON- have a half marathon to run in May
vertical runner to the rescue prompt and extremely knowledgeable service
-PRON- have -PRON- foot sized walk analyze and shoe purchase in less than 20 minute
have an excellent experience and will undoubtedly be back when the time come to purchase -PRON- next pair of running shoe
-PRON- mother sing in the chorus of the tales of huffman 35 year ago
-PRON- take -PRON- to see the production at four seasons centre in toronto and -PRON- have the great experience
-PRON- go to pick up rush seat at 10 a.m. the morning of the show and not only be the lineup
the most civil experience of -PRON- life but the staff be unbelievably helpful
-PRON- have amazing box seat and enjoy everything about the performance and the venue
can not go wrong with this place
the food be consistent and fresh
only issue be the price increase -PRON- have see the last 2 yrs
some price have go up 20 although -PRON- be willing to attribute that to operating expense and not price fixing as -PRON- have notice the asian eatery there seem to work together instead of compete
-PRON- be a great place professional unique healthy food and quick service but -PRON- would re evaluate if -PRON- hit $ 8\/bowl
-PRON- be hard for -PRON- to rate a place that -PRON- frequent simply because -PRON- live right by -PRON- so -PRON- be try to look at this from the perspective of -PRON- not live so close
-PRON- like the general atmosphere especially the patio which be always awesome on a beautiful day
however -PRON- do not know about the service
-PRON- always feel like -PRON- be put -PRON- server or bartender out when -PRON- be ask for something
why be in the service industry if -PRON- do not want to be even slightly attentive to -PRON- table
-PRON- can understand if -PRON- be short staffed but -PRON- never seem that way
if -PRON- be in a hurry -PRON- do not suggest come here when -PRON- be remotely busy as even something simple can take quite awhile
the food be average nothing to write home about but not bad either
good beer selection and some unique good drink too
this be a pretty good place to go if -PRON- do not mind put in a little elbow grease
-PRON- use to use the soap and brush but for the shoddy finish on -PRON- car -PRON- now just use the spray soap and rinse
-PRON- can detail the car in a bay around the corner just after the vacuuming
the price be fair and if -PRON- be fast -PRON- can get a wash for about $ 1.75 minimum or so
vacuum cost $ 1 -PRON- believe again only if -PRON- be fast
there be an attendant that walk the ground during the day so -PRON- can feel reasonably safe here
the attendant be a nice guy but do not break -PRON- rule
there be a couple machine that will exchange -PRON- green for token
-PRON- can buy towel in the vacuum lane
there be a small office where the attendant hang out who will -PRON- assume take -PRON- money for an automate wash or provide other accessory like air freshener
very old school place but -PRON- like -PRON-
-PRON- can not go wrong here so get off the couch and clean -PRON- car
if -PRON- lucky -PRON- may get serenade with some authentic mexican music from the guy vacuum -PRON- car next to -PRON-
have fun
go to the new mayo location
food and service be very good
-PRON- really do not like the fact that -PRON- leave the entire restaurant part open with a cafeteria like feel
the raise stage be leave in place
no divider between any of the table way too open not at all warm or cozy
if -PRON- look around -PRON- do not get the feel of a mexican restaurant very bare and plain jane
if -PRON- be look for the typical average mexican food without any ambiance or association with be in a mexican food restaurant well enjoy
this be -PRON- preferred location because -PRON- usually have an electric scooter or even two available
-PRON- mother and -PRON- be both disabled -PRON- more than -PRON-
so -PRON- almost always get one right away
the employee inside the store be somewhat scarce when -PRON- need help but the checkout employee more than make up with -PRON- with -PRON- speed accuracy and above all -PRON- pleasant manner in which -PRON- speak with -PRON- and do -PRON- job
very happy and satisfied with this location
and -PRON- drive further from -PRON- house which be near the sossaman store because of the scooter and employee
wonderful restaurant
make sure to get -PRON- reservation ahead of time or do what -PRON- do
come during the off hour
take a cousin who be vegan and absolutely love be able to order freely
fun vibe and great date spot even if -PRON- can get a little loud
klasse atmosfehre nette leute
die drinks und der cafe dafür gibt 's eine
note 1 von mir
da geh ich gerne wieder hin
extremely delicious sushi spot in the heart of the cosmopolitan quickly become -PRON- favorite hotel on the strip

-PRON- compliment to the chef for the creative use of serrano pepper which appear in several of -PRON- favorite dish a yellowtail serrano wasabi roll and a calamari with lime and serrano
delish
-PRON- do not personally drink anymore but -PRON- party try several cocktail include a stellar whiskey drink that include a hand cut ice cube and smoke burn from a japanese tree

two thing to keep in mind if -PRON- be go 1 as with all place on the strip -PRON- be good of make a reservation
-PRON- group get lucky and find a spot at the bar but most group be wait 30 minute or more
2 -PRON- will spend money to get the good
-PRON- group of 3 eat -PRON- fill with only a few drink and spend nearly $ 500
this be not a budget stop but -PRON- do not disappoint
this forever 21 have a very nice set up
-PRON- walk in the store and immediately notice the accessory area
-PRON- have ring necklace earring belt and etc
-PRON- be really reasonable and be cheap enough to wear a few time and not feel bad ditch when the trend be over
-PRON- find many work appropriate piece and -PRON- be fun pick out accessory
this area be surprisingly organize even though many girl have go through this area
the other room -PRON- notice be the nude or neutral colored room
-PRON- have the cut outfit on the mannequin
the quality of the clothe be decent for the price -PRON- be pay
just walk around the store -PRON- get a lot of different idea for different outfit
thing be lay out nicely and the cashier be quick
warning
the food be not good
peter piper pizza be good and that be not say much
that be say -PRON- do not come here for pizza
-PRON- be all about the nostalgic organ music
-PRON- be a great time with friend and family
-PRON- only take cash so pull some out before -PRON- come
check the website
often time there be deal that be go on
-PRON- definitely have to come check -PRON- out if -PRON- live close by
so where do -PRON- start
huh huh huh
-PRON- son can make good pizza than this place
must be own by that break tabaz guy
this place be super popular and -PRON- can see why
-PRON- have a bit of a wait when -PRON- get there
but after only maybe 5 10 minute -PRON- be seat
the place be small so be prepared to be touch elbow with the table next to -PRON- but -PRON- be the food that -PRON- come here for not so much the ambiance
-PRON- order three different kind of the chang fen the char siew beef and shrimp and just shrimp and -PRON- be all good
-PRON- favourite be the shrimp the simple the good for -PRON-
-PRON- also get the deep fry dough with condense milk and -PRON- be amazing sweet and crunchy and just wonderful
the chang fen be a bit more money than a regular dim sum place around $ 3 5 or so but -PRON- be a lot large in portion size and quite a bit tasty
the soy sauce be the perfect amount of sweet and savory
the restaurant -PRON- be clean enough and again -PRON- be small but -PRON- do manage to pack a bunch of people in there
and -PRON- turn around very quickly
-PRON- find the service to be good
-PRON- get -PRON- food quickly and -PRON- even order some to go
and -PRON- get that near the end of -PRON- meal
so -PRON- work out nicely
this be a nice substitute for dim sum if -PRON- just feel like the rice noodle and maybe some congee especially on a cold day this would be perfect
con need more fan or close door and use ac
very noisy
not much of a beer selection pros decent food taste and serve size
decent service
as always -PRON- love what -PRON- friend rachel do to -PRON- hair
great friend great service
gracias amiga

so -PRON- turn to yelp to find a mover
after go through multiple review for multiple company -PRON- call smooth transition
-PRON- speak with alex who be very professional courteous helpful and upfront about pricing
-PRON- set the date and everything be confirm as -PRON- say -PRON- would be
the day of the move -PRON- husband be call tell -PRON- be run early and could come get start
kevin and another mover
-PRON- be sorry
-PRON- do not know -PRON- name come to do the move
-PRON- be at work but -PRON- husband and in law be thoroughly impressed with how hard the guy work
when everything be do -PRON- see -PRON- husband and fil be have some issue put -PRON- bed back together and stay to assist

but -PRON- be appreciate
this be a company who know how to provide great service and do the little thing that help out -PRON- customer
-PRON- be hop this be -PRON- last move for awhile however this be the company to call if -PRON- need help again
-PRON- highly recommend smooth transition movers
actually -PRON- do not know why this place have such good review
-PRON- come here base on the high yelp review and -PRON- all disappoint -PRON-
this place be at good 2 star

-PRON- group come here because -PRON- be crave raman and after all the review suggest the ichiza ramen dx -PRON- all get -PRON-
yes all 5 of -PRON- and boy do -PRON- make a mistake
the raman in the bowl be awful
-PRON- be all stick together like one big piece of dough
-PRON- think -PRON- be only -PRON- bowl but all 5 of -PRON- have the same issue
the one piece of pork belly in the bowl be full of fat and a tiny little piece of meat
the broth be super salty and be not flavorful
should -PRON- go on
the appetizer be mediocre
-PRON- do not realize the baby bokchoy mean a baby 's dish
literally a tiny portion
-PRON- do not know what else to say here except that -PRON- do not recommend
-PRON- can talk about all the appetizer -PRON- get but none be really good to waste time reviewing
met rand out here for the buffet lunch
the place be 3\/4 full when -PRON- get there about 11:30
start with a basic salad of green with some add in and choice of about 6 dressing
then a couple of pizza trip with some pasta and bread stick
the pizza be ok but not great
the pasta be keep in small tin in a warm and the pizza be under heat lamp
nothing stay out for long
so -PRON- have a pretty good handle on how much to have out at any one time
plates be another story -PRON- run completely out for a short time
-PRON- have notice the server run around ask if people be do with -PRON- plate as -PRON- get there
so -PRON- would guess -PRON- do not have enough
-PRON- have start thin out by the time -PRON- leave an hour later so -PRON- apparently have an early crowd for lunch in the area
great beer especially the stuff -PRON- brew in house
brunch be amazing too
check -PRON- out
this be the good experience ever
dr martin be amazing
the vet tech be amazing
-PRON- wish -PRON- know -PRON- name

-PRON- be so good with -PRON-
-PRON- be have poop problem and -PRON- solve the mystery
-PRON- apparently eat trash and end up eliminate there at the office
-PRON- be so understand about -PRON-
-PRON- do not try any upsell -PRON- just make sure -PRON- be ok
-PRON- could have demand x ray and such but -PRON- do not

but i do not feel -PRON- worth -PRON-
and there be a lot already go with a great group or on a good night and maybe a star or 2 different for -PRON-
good pho in town hand down
owners work in kitchen and always make sure every dish be prepare to perfection
-PRON- stay at this hotel for free and -PRON- be still not worth -PRON-
-PRON- go for a three day business conference which be organize by an outside company
there be the main hotel and then all these outlying building which be terrace up steep hill
-PRON- be go for a hike each time -PRON- leave -PRON- room and return
there be cars\/van -PRON- can call to take -PRON- back and forth from the conference area to -PRON- room but -PRON- be not readily available and -PRON- can wait 20 minute for a ride
horrible layout
there be an adult pool in the main hotel which be ok but super date
-PRON- walk down to the other pool which -PRON- give -PRON- a bracelet for when -PRON- check in and tell -PRON- numerous time how -PRON- will pay $ 25 if -PRON- lose -PRON-
this pool be full of kid so -PRON- leave quickly and after read all the other review about -PRON- be full of pee -PRON- be glad -PRON- do
there be ton of beautiful resort in phoenix that be cheap in the summer
pick anywhere but here
this place be always short staffed
2 teller on a saturday be -PRON- kid -PRON-
and let -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- be certainly in no hurry to get customer out
-PRON- have come in during the week and there be usually only one teller
so this be not a one time thing
-PRON- would think with all the fee -PRON- charge -PRON- would be able to afford to get more employee here
-PRON- have a great glimpse into blt steak from bar seating and the appetizer menu
entrée price be very high for -PRON- late evening stop in
the waitress be friendly and prompt with -PRON- beverage of choice import beer in the $ 7 range
-PRON- order potato skin and a soufflé crepe in passion fruit sauce
at least 10 flavorful potato skin arrive
the crepe be to die for decadent possibly the good food -PRON- eat all week while there
that alone would make -PRON- want to return
-PRON- bring over complimentary popover -PRON- huge signature gruyere laced yorkshire pudding type thing
-PRON- find -PRON- to be too crusty almost burn on the outsde but -PRON- enjoy pick out the cheesy flaky innard
and free be a nice touch
-PRON- be a trendy place to hang out and not too loud -PRON- could converse
-PRON- be tuck in an intimate corner of the large lobby floor and be one of only two restaurant in this hotel bally 's
come here for the first time last night to see motley crue
motley crue be good however -PRON- personally do not think this be a great venue for concert
-PRON- be extremely smokey inside and the acoustic suck
a huge brawl break out near -PRON- in section nosebleed 204
when the show be over -PRON- be impossible to get out of the parking garage
-PRON- finally give up and park the car and take a cab to a bar off the strip
while some people may not think park road books measure up to a huge chain like border 's this shop be every bit as good in term of book and customer service
park road books be one of the few remain independently own book store in charlotte and -PRON- deserve -PRON- support
due to size -PRON-
doens't have quite the selection of a store like borders but -PRON- have good fiction and child 's section and be sure -PRON- will find all the classic here
if there be something -PRON- want that -PRON- do not have just ask -PRON- will be happy to order -PRON- for -PRON-
this place be amazing
-PRON- recommend the roasted pork with the greek potato
-PRON- also have the baklava cheesecake and -PRON- also be excellent
-PRON- kid have the souvlaki with fry
-PRON- really like -PRON- and the fry be excellent
-PRON- have be go to michelle for 5 year and would not have anyone else do -PRON- injection
-PRON- always educate -PRON- on -PRON- option be conscious of budget
-PRON- recommend -PRON- to all -PRON- friend
okay actually like this place and -PRON- would have be a 4\/5 but the reason -PRON- lose a star be for the ear piercing volume
-PRON- can not even think straight with how loud -PRON- be in there
and whenever there be a change in the beat or a new song everyone jump from be startled
-PRON- swear people be grab -PRON- ear or grimace from the pain
-PRON- find -PRON- to be so hilarious that -PRON- ignore everyone 's reaction and protest
even the staff be agitate and become hoarse from try to communicate with the patron
other than that this place be awesome
the decor be so cool and unlike anything -PRON- can find in vegas
remind -PRON- of hogwarts but with booze and cigarette drag
-PRON- be obsess with the fireplace
the cherry on top be that this be the only place in downtown la vegas with the hot look guy that -PRON- have see so far
or maybe that be the night
the griffin have a beacon for hot european man
that be the only reason -PRON- stick -PRON- out through the ear shattering music for another 20 minute
-PRON- do not know the drink price because -PRON- never have to pay for -PRON- drink but -PRON- be delicious and generous on the alcohol
seating be a pain in the butt
and -PRON- be super crowded
so if -PRON- get a seat stay put
do not even lift a butt cheek because someone will be perch and ready to swoop in should -PRON- move completely off -PRON- seat
there be a nice sized room in the far back with a dj for dancing
the bouncer and security be kind of rude but pay -PRON- no mind because -PRON- be probably miserable from have to deal with drunk idiot and pretentious tourist
-PRON- have be a very long time that -PRON- have be back but -PRON- will come back again because -PRON- deserve another chance
hopefully -PRON- will be good than the last
-PRON- will be update but until then go ahead and stop by to check -PRON- out
bring ear protection just in case
-PRON- go there last nite 3\/7\/13 the time be approx 630 and there be lot of car so think -PRON- would try -PRON-
-PRON- be seat promptly but that be where the service stop
as -PRON- enter there be a young lady talk on -PRON- phone while sweep the floor
-PRON- think this unusual
-PRON- be instruct to help -PRON-
-PRON- go a check out the selection and all of the food appear to be stale and old
-PRON- ask the fry cook if -PRON- could make beef and pea pod with beef sauce and -PRON- do not understand a word -PRON- say
so -PRON- follow the instruction and inform -PRON- teriaki sauce and when -PRON- be do -PRON- be just beef pea pod and no sauce of any kind
-PRON- try the sweet and sour shrimp and the shrimp be tough and chewey
-PRON- then try the fry rice and -PRON- be cold
meanwhile the girl be still on the phone and be just walk around
-PRON- friend have a variety of dish and have the same experience
not once do a server come by and ask how -PRON- be or need a refill on drink
but the bill come and to -PRON- surprise -PRON- be astronomical for the quality of the food and service the amount be $ 27.77
-PRON- could have steak and potato for that price
when -PRON- ask about the girl on the phone which be approx 45 minute after -PRON- enter the hostess say -PRON- be the owner daughter
make sense
friendly staff who be always prompt and get to -PRON- order quickly
relatively slow
so -PRON- never have to wait in line either
-PRON- have be here twice and the food be awesome both time
the staff and owner be all very friendly and attentive
the price be right as well
-PRON- would recommend this place every day
by far the most amazing hangover pho -PRON- have ever have in -PRON- life hand down
beautiful place but terrible service
terrible food
atmosphere be middle age white couple
-PRON- be a group of people from different ethnicity and be pretty much out of place
not good for big group
-PRON- be not accommodate at all
for such a pricey place -PRON- would think the food would be good
-PRON- be so bad and do not even taste fresh
very disappointed would not come back
awesome place especially start in march every second friday be bike night and the food be make special and free to everybody who show up
always a band and fun fun fun
sit on the big porch inside at the bar or picnic table outside
just a great fun getaway place and 10 degree cooler than vegas
people be super friendly and -PRON- always meet new people
fantastic music on the juke box when the band be not play and dance around the bar
drinks be super reasonable too
fun
stop here while walk the strip be surprised at how big -PRON- be
four floor of m&m candy clothe toy all the m&m merch -PRON- could want
and as a bonus there be a free 3d movie that be pretty cute worth watch
lot of kid can get pretty congested but if -PRON- be stop with kid or just like chocolate who do not
-PRON- be definitely worth at least a walk around
here -PRON- have a perfect view of bellagio fountains and the service be perfect
the restaurant -PRON- be beautiful classy and elegant
the ceiling of the restaurant be cover with colorful clothe such as purple yellow and red
-PRON- be very beautiful
-PRON- go there before go to see a show on the strip
the service be excellent friendly server happy to chat with -PRON- tell -PRON- a few story make -PRON- feel welcome
-PRON- have a good bread basket
the food be excellent as well

-PRON- love -PRON-
truffle
fry
that be basically all -PRON- need to say here
-PRON- move here from boston so -PRON- will say that this definitely more of a midwestern tapas place
not in the sense that the food be midwestern but the portion be a bit big
this be not a negative against the restaurant um more truffle fry please
just keep this in mind when -PRON- be order here
the cocktail be fantastic and cheap
thankfully this please be around the corner from where -PRON- live so -PRON- frequently go here when -PRON- be in the mood for something a little on the fancy side
whatev -PRON- do order the truffle fry
-PRON- consider -PRON- a french fry connoisseur and these be some of the good -PRON- have have
-PRON- be give -PRON- 4 and not 5 because every
single
dessert
have cinnamon and -PRON- be allergic
-PRON- love dessert and frankly this just be not necessary
overall
fabulous
-PRON- fiance and -PRON- be in the process of decide whether -PRON- want to leave -PRON- beloved portland oregon and move across the country to charlotte when -PRON- first visit the midwood smokehouse

-PRON- be flavorful moist and just enough food
-PRON- love all of the side too
-PRON- have great service at the bar and then sit outside under the cover patio
-PRON- only have to wait a few minute for a table even on what seem to be a busy night
this make the very long list of restaurant that convince -PRON- that -PRON- would be able to survive in charlotte
-PRON- will see -PRON- in july queen city
really great torta and fry
service be great and -PRON- definitely recommend this place if -PRON- look for authentic mexican food
-PRON- have be go to the draft house for many year and have always enjoy the food and the experience but lately the food have not be that good and the new staff in the dining room have alot to be desire
-PRON- be unattentive give -PRON- the wrong check have to beg for a drink refill and be pre occupy with something else go on not a good experience very disappointed
i be approach by some lady at walmart a couple of year back
and -PRON- tell -PRON- i have the modeling look
so -PRON- take -PRON- info and give -PRON- -PRON- number
and -PRON- set -PRON- up an appointment and tell -PRON- everything i want to hear so -PRON- idiot self sign with -PRON- and -PRON- start charge -PRON- for stupid useless class and photo shoot
-PRON- mom end up pay almost $ 1,000.00
i book one job with -PRON- and -PRON- take almost all -PRON- check from the job and take 5 month to pay -PRON-
-PRON- stop go to the class and never pay -PRON- another dime because i start realize -PRON- be just a scam like john robert powers
now -PRON- be send -PRON- letter say -PRON- be go to send -PRON- to collection and that i owe -PRON- over $ 1000.00
this place be nothing but a scam and all -PRON- want be -PRON- money do not fall into the same trap i do
-PRON- have solid food special -PRON- get an extra large pizza and 24 wing for $ 20
the food be great too
the only problem -PRON- have there be that one of the wing -PRON- order boneless be raw
-PRON- do not mean undercooked -PRON- mean crunchy raw
-PRON- know that this be probably just a one off but -PRON- can not overlook -PRON- not with chicken
hopefully next time -PRON- go back -PRON- will earn a high rating
ultimately though -PRON- would definitely recommend this place for pizza
after eat korean food -PRON- feel like have a dessert

pricey as far as mexican food go but the food service and atmosphere be excellent and the portion be huge
get a table by the window for a gorgeous view
-PRON- be a little chilly there if -PRON- be a cool evening so dress accordingly but worth -PRON-
even have a great kid menu
service get a little slow as the evening get later and -PRON- get very busy so if -PRON- bring kid -PRON- recommend get there earlier in the evening
definitely recommend this place
food be good but do not understand -PRON- upgrade menu choice
-PRON- ask -PRON- to pay more to get more of a certain item on the 4 protein entrée but then -PRON- have to drop one of the other protein
then -PRON- bump -PRON- up to the extra amount and -PRON- make -PRON- drop another item
do not make sense
and -PRON- certainly do not get 45 dollar worth of q.
eat here
tommy 's be just the place -PRON- need to be
possibly the only place in town at which -PRON- would want to become a regular
trust the special savor the desert and enjoy great service

eat here
this be -PRON- first and last time there
-PRON- come for -PRON- good friend birthday

-PRON- believe -PRON- be new because -PRON- be not very knowledgeable about the menu
-PRON- be a manager at a restaurant -PRON- good friend be a manager at a restaurant and the other 6 people at the table be in the industry as well
the server be new be no problem to -PRON- although -PRON- would have be to other
after wait an hour for food 3 entree come out with no potato
-PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- be out
why would -PRON- not tell -PRON- that so -PRON- could sub the side or order something else instead of send food out with no side
also the menu state tostone with the entree yet -PRON- come out with plantain chip
the bbq pork chop come out with no bbq sauce
2 new entree be order to replace 2 out of the 3 that come out wrong
1 come out ok
the second pork chop come out rare and again with no bbq sauce

-PRON- have no dinner that night at -PRON- dinner party

-PRON- be not a massage chair
-PRON- a lay flat chair not a big deal
what i get be a regular foot massage and back rub
i repeatedly ask -PRON- to work on -PRON- shoulder blade knot
-PRON- would work -PRON- for 30 second and then off to another part
ugh
language be a barrier
-PRON- just nod alot and ignore -PRON- request
on leave -PRON- hover outside the curtain while i dress
wait for the tip -PRON- be sure
-PRON- speak in chinese to the receptionist at the desk while -PRON- run -PRON- cc to tell -PRON- how much i tip
i just find -PRON- to be so rude and tacky
-PRON- send -PRON- off without any of the common courtesy
do not ask how the service be no thank -PRON-
no goodbye
-PRON- be not return and -PRON- probably do not care
-PRON- get dinner at this brewery every year when -PRON- be in vegas
-PRON- be the perfect place downtown to grab a bite to eat
the food be good than most of what -PRON- will find in vegas and for a much cheap price
-PRON- do not drink beer but everyone else say the good be good as well
-PRON- get the chicken katsu slider the kahlua pork slider and the tiger bomb sushi roll

and -PRON- definitely get a lot for -PRON- money
great place to order from if -PRON- be have a party or event
love this restaurant
-PRON- have be search for a yummy mexican restaurant in vegas for a long while and -PRON- come across this one during this past trip
the good part for -PRON- be that this restaurant and -PRON- staff really understand gluten free which be an absolute necessity for -PRON- husband who have celiac disease
-PRON- have a gluten free menu available for -PRON- and yes the chip be gluten free fry in -PRON- own fryer
this be actually very rare back here in chicago so -PRON- be nice to see vegas step up
-PRON- eat the fish taco
pretty darn tasty although a little rich for -PRON- so -PRON- could not finish -PRON- all and there be only two
-PRON- husband have the gluten free enchiladas verde and -PRON- be in love
-PRON- think the good part for the both of -PRON- be the amazing guacamole make fresh at the table

overall top notch
hello kitty dream come true if -PRON- be into this sort of thing

lol
this location be a wet dream for any hk fan
-PRON- drop into the keg for a couple of hour pre easter week end for some drink and food with friend
let -PRON- first start off by say that -PRON- have always be a fan of the keg because in -PRON- opinion -PRON- be very god quality at -PRON- price point especially in a city with many very high end steak house
-PRON- will start either drink as -PRON- do when -PRON- actually get there
if -PRON- have read any if -PRON- other review -PRON- know that -PRON- be a fan of classic cocktail
-PRON- order a negroni to start as suggest by one of -PRON- fave peep from chase who be join -PRON-
-PRON- be very good in term of balance
sometimes -PRON- find that -PRON- be easy to water down or add some filler to a negroni but such be not the case here
next -PRON- order an old fashioned
-PRON- be ok but frankly -PRON- think that there may have be some vanilla bitter add because -PRON- have a strong taste to -PRON- that be unusual
for good since there be a few of -PRON- -PRON- order and share
-PRON- try the slider the bacon wrap scallop and the tuna taco
-PRON- have to say all 3 be excellent and again reasonably price
-PRON- will definitely be come back here more regularly as the weather warm up because there be a decent sized patio to enjoy as well
-PRON- have be here before and have a good experience but on other occasion the attention to detail be poor
today -PRON- go in grant -PRON- be a busy saturday
-PRON- be upsold on a detail package for $ 40 where -PRON- be go to really treat -PRON- leather dash and floor mat with some very special lotion that would clean and enhance the life of the leather
-PRON- two daughter and -PRON- sit in the lobby for an hour and -PRON- vehicle still be not do
-PRON- watch and for 30 minute -PRON- car sit there untouched by anyone
-PRON- finally go up to the front and tell -PRON- -PRON- be completely unacceptable
-PRON- apologize and say -PRON- be short staffed but would not give -PRON- a refund
-PRON- end up with two free wash card from -PRON- and a vehicle that be almost as dirty as when -PRON- arrive
-PRON- will use these two free wash card and then -PRON- be finish with this place
be look for a buffet in vegas to take -PRON- 21 yo nephew to and this be close to where -PRON- be stay
-PRON- get here and there be a line not many people maybe 20 but -PRON- still take 45 minute to get seat
the hostess have no sense of urgency
-PRON- finally walk in to the buffet that be probably 50 empty
the place be filthy and the food be good at the golden corral
-PRON- have be here several time so -PRON- definitely feel like -PRON- can give an honest review
the service be great
very friendly and sweet lady who run -PRON-
also the boy who help be great too
-PRON- have try many thing on the menu and -PRON- have enjoy -PRON- all
the price be also great
all in all -PRON- would say good food good service and good price
-PRON- have have a lot of different waxer at european wax center
-PRON- tend to come and go
-PRON- have be get wax for over 10 year and racquel be the good -PRON- have ever have
-PRON- take -PRON- time do an amazing job and never once do the wax hurt
not once
that have never happen to -PRON- in all -PRON- year of get wax
please keep racquel
-PRON- be so good
-PRON- would follow -PRON- to any location -PRON- work at
the pho broth be amazing
such great flavor and great portion size
-PRON- also try the spring roll
so delicious
-PRON- will definitely be come back
-PRON- have not have pho this good in a long time
definitely the good since move to arizona
-PRON- can not wait to go back
where have this place be all of -PRON- desert life
everything -PRON- have give -PRON- to put in -PRON- mouth have be amazing
-PRON- would compare -PRON- lobster bisque to world famous in san diego
fish and chips be killer
$ 2 fish tacos on monday be terrific
cioppino be a pleaser
seabass excellent
for the non seafoodie famous fried chicken hit the spot
service be great as well
okay so this place be great because -PRON- have delicious food
-PRON- make large taco with great flavor the carnita be -PRON- favorite
the guacamole be also wonderful
a couple of thing to improve have more reliable delivery available and a website with the menu
when -PRON- ask about delivery -PRON- live within a half mile -PRON- be not sure if -PRON- could deliver even though -PRON- be within -PRON- delivery hour
when -PRON- ask about a menu for delivery -PRON- tell -PRON- to take a picture of the menu
-PRON- be sure that those wrinkle will get iron out but -PRON- deduct a star for the inconvenience
overall -PRON- be one of -PRON- regular place
if -PRON- be think about some mexican definitely give this one a try
food be great although -PRON- do not know if -PRON- warrant a 1 1\/2 hour wait
-PRON- luck out and find a table in the bar area which be first come first serve
basically a glorified grill cheese with whatev -PRON- can think of in the sandwich
like most meal today -PRON- could have be half the size and still fill -PRON- up so split the order with someone else if -PRON- can
-PRON- would eat there about once a year because -PRON- will take that long to burn off the calorie count
enjoy
have lunch here twice
the wrap be great
good coffee and dessert but most of all -PRON- be about service and the service be excellent
until next time
how this get a 4.5 average on yelp be beyond -PRON-
-PRON- speak to the lack of decent asian food of any type in charlotte
-PRON- will start with the positive service be good the place be clean all food be hot and price be quite reasonable for dinner
the negative every item -PRON- order be devoid of any flavor
steer clear of the pad thai and the basil stir fry which have no basil
-PRON- really want to like this place since -PRON- be right around the corner from -PRON- but -PRON- doubt -PRON- will be persuade to return
bellagio be a classic now hide amongst all the big and good or just new casino
-PRON- always like bellagio -PRON- be timeless kinda like gucci
-PRON- be ceiling boast the well know blown glass flower above the lobby and the ever change garden tuck away behind -PRON-
-PRON- be spring be in the air theme when -PRON- be there
-PRON- be there on official toyota business ahem so -PRON- have dinner the first night in a banquet room that -PRON- would give a solid 3 star too maybe the fact there be an open bar there solidify the star but the meal be pretty good consider -PRON- flight be delay and -PRON- be late as hell
ok so -PRON- then go to xs and after a few cocktail come home an order room service
mmm brioche french toast
3 a.m. thankyouverymuch
do not forget the side of burn bacon
ooh that be good
-PRON- like the casino there the ground pool and cabana
be nice
but so -PRON- the 24 hour room service
god -PRON- love vegas
-PRON- have to say -PRON- even taste good cold when -PRON- break off a piece the next morning
so -PRON- applaud -PRON- for stay true to the game as one of many vegas classic hotel amongst the slew of trendiness that be spread like wildfire across lv
the other review for this place be really spot on
cash only
no seating
take out only
be prepared with what -PRON- want kind of feel like the soup nazi a little bit and -PRON- be slow to make decision panic mode
but -PRON- be pretty darn good
the chicken be fresh and crispy
-PRON- have the 1\/4 chicken dark meat meal
really good chicken
-PRON- do not do fake\/over process chicken no boneless anything
and when -PRON- ask the lady at the register if -PRON- do chicken strip -PRON- smile and say no baby this be real thing only
perfect response
-PRON- will definitely come back here with a little blanket to sit on the grass
on aime bien le général tao mai c' cher pas trop de stationnement
belle petite terrasse pour ceux
qui aiment ça
service assez long quand même
great sandwich the good in town consistent for so many year at the same location never disappoint
go through and order 2 cheeseburger and be very disappointed when -PRON- ask for hot mustard and be tell -PRON- would have to pay to get any
-PRON- be tell -PRON- do not have nugget
so -PRON- have to pay
-PRON- find that a little ridiculous consider every other mcdonald 's do not have this rule
be tell to call and complain to the owner which -PRON- will be do
woman who actually give -PRON- -PRON- food be fine but the fact that -PRON- have to pay to get any sauce be dumb
this place be a legit speakeasy
off the hook drink
lay back atmosphere
super small place maybe no more than 25 seat if -PRON- be remember correctly
this be a great spot for a date or to hang with friend
very good place
be recommend to -PRON- by a concierge in the fairmont royal york
the waiter be quick energetic and interesting individual
the food be great from the antipasti to the dessert
everything be top notch
only thing be the lighting be kind of dark
so -PRON- be hard to see the menu if -PRON- do not really have good eyesight but otherwise the restaurant have a very cozy and warm feel
would definitely recommend this place
this be probably the big letdown of a burger\/hotdog -PRON- have ever have
-PRON- fiancée and -PRON- be stay at the bellagio with a fountain facing view
-PRON- notice the wahlburger sign from -PRON- room
and -PRON- a burger enthusiast be excited to be able to try -PRON-
-PRON- go for lunch\/dinner yesterday and both be starve so -PRON- should have be easy to please -PRON-
-PRON- order a double wahlburger w\/ ch and two hotdog with ketchup\/mustard\/onion
-PRON- fiancée get the seared chicken sandwich
food do not take too long to come out which be the only pleasant part about -PRON- venture here
the chicken sandwich which -PRON- have a bite of have a awkward texture and mouthfeel about -PRON-
almost as if -PRON- have a 20%+ water solution pump into -PRON-
the condiment on the sandwich be decent but -PRON- chicken -PRON- just be well below standard
next the hot dog the bad part of the meal
-PRON- eat a lot of food and two dog and burger be nothing
-PRON- only eat one
bad over cooked dog in stale bread just not worth -PRON- at all
the burger be ok
nothing -PRON- would ever crave and be sad because in n out burger be so close by
-PRON- will never be go to a wahlburger again

the sweet corn bisque be yummy but be not consistently warm
the center of the soup be really hot and the rest be cool
the lobster mac and cheese be a good mac and cheese but have way too much bread
and -PRON- count only two small piece of lobster
-PRON- friend order emeril 's pork chop with caramelize sweet potato and green chili mole
the good thing on that plate be the sweet potato
good falafel in vegas
perfect place for vegan and shwarma lover alike
-PRON- suggest the falafel wrap with hot sauce all the veggie and add the roasted eggplant and dolma on the side
-PRON- eat here over the summer for the first time and the food be like art on a plate
-PRON- be very pricey and the portion be small but the food quality and taste be excellent
the menu choice be pretty limited so to start i go with the sear scallop -PRON- be perfectly cook and tasty
but -PRON- have a sweet sauce that i be not too fond of

-PRON- have schedule several consultation around the city base on word of mouth and review online
square salon be on -PRON- list
-PRON- have make an appointment with one of the stylist for a consultation but be in the area a week prior to -PRON- appointment and decide to find the salon and just go inside to check -PRON- out
here be the sweet part the salon -PRON- be very modern and have high energy loud lot of people etc
here be the bitter part the minute -PRON- walk through the front door the receptionist look -PRON- up and down and give -PRON- the jealous stink eye look and be act like -PRON- be a hot shot and pretty much ignore -PRON-
not cool
seriously -PRON- feel like julia roberts in pretty woman when -PRON- walk into the boutique and the snobby woman would not help -PRON-
needless to say -PRON- cancel -PRON- consultation
-PRON- have get 5 second to make a first impression and the bad part about this the stylist never even get a chance
-PRON- spend lot of money each month on -PRON- hair miss receptionist lady big mistake huge

-PRON- be very professional in draping as well
room be very nice just like the spa on the strip
great cut open on sunday which be a real plus
the guy who cut -PRON- hair do a great job

so impressed after -PRON- first visit
-PRON- see a pic post that -PRON- have to try-
sushi cupcake be awesome
-PRON- be a limited time menu item accord to the sign

-PRON- have plenty of seafood in -PRON- as well
this store at the linq promenade be not busy during -PRON- tuesday at 4 pm visit and service be quick and friendly
-PRON- be not sure if the cupcake be premade but -PRON- would guess not
-PRON- wait be minimal and the entire restaurant be clean
before -PRON- leave -PRON- tell one of the employee how much -PRON- enjoy the meal and -PRON- give -PRON- some coupon for next time
score
terrific food and service
wait like no minute during a browns game to get a boatload of food
love the location in kamm 's
that cheapotle across the street be an abomination
should war ever break out between the two -PRON- would strap on -PRON- coon skin cap and defend si senor like davy crockett at the alamo
chip be particularly crisp and light
beef in chimichanga be tender and melt in -PRON- mouth
a can not miss
this be -PRON- first trip to las vegas and in addition to the casino and show -PRON- have hear wonderful thing about the buffet as well
-PRON- decide to have lunch at cravings and will probably will never return if ever at the mirage hotel again
-PRON- receive a discount as part of the conference -PRON- be attend which -PRON- have to fight over with the cashier who do not want to honor -PRON-
anyhow -PRON- eventually sit down and proceed to sample the different cuisine -PRON- offer american asian italian and so on
the food be average at good most of the pasta be dry and overcook and most of the food just do not look fresh and appetizing
the crab be dry and seem old and hardly any meat
the good part of cravings be the generous serving of the carve meat and the chef 's corner where unlike the other serve station -PRON- could receive fresh pasta cook -PRON- way
the dessert selection be ample however most of the dessert be note very good but with the exemption of a very few
-PRON- feel a like a piccadilly cafeteria restaurant experience and not one worthy of the mirage hotel and las vegas
but -PRON- guess base on the price -PRON- be reasonable
this be a place for a quick lunch with the kid but do not expect a famous las vegas buffet experience here
-PRON- get what -PRON- pay for
everything be excellent at pomo
friendly staff and superior food
nice setting
amazing food and wine choice
-PRON- be a genuine taste of italy in arizona
the pizzas be truly delicious
the carpaccio be sublime
great restaurant
-PRON- go for brunch with friend and will definitely be back
the portion be large the staff be friendly and the food be really good
try the deep fry devil egg
the only downside be no alcohol but -PRON- totally forget about that once -PRON- start eat
great local eatery
friendly staff and great food
the micro brew be exceptional
-PRON- will be back
fantastic job host a party of 150 people
-PRON- have the entire restaurant for a company event
the food and service be both excellent
look toward to -PRON- return
walk by here look cozy so -PRON- eat
first thing -PRON- would notice be the open kitchen and sandwich area as soon as -PRON- walk in
right side be the wine bar leave side be the dining room
the menu be interesting
-PRON- have -PRON- tabbouleh steak brick chicken cream of mushroom warm s'more pie and butter tart
not in one night -PRON- silly sausage
the tabbouleh be not exactly the tabbouleh -PRON- would expect
-PRON- would describe -PRON- as -PRON- would not order -PRON- again
check out the photo
-PRON- upload for -PRON-
the skirt steak be quite juicy
brick chicken be very interesting
-PRON- be chicken press on by bacon press on by chicken
-PRON- like a chicken sandwich
yum cream of mushroom which have real mushroom be pretty good but not as good as the one -PRON- have in philly fri sat sun
probably because -PRON- do not put in any brandy
-PRON- be not a big fan of s'more but -PRON- s'more pie change -PRON- life
as one of the follow four squarer say -PRON- be like eat a chocolate cover angel
-PRON- could not agree more
-PRON- also have -PRON- butter tart which be pretty much heaven in a form of a tart
gosh -PRON- be drool as -PRON- type
-PRON- regular menu be pretty diversified
got rabbit stew burger pizza poutine a lot of canadian soul food
-PRON- have a special menu which be write on the wall
sometimes -PRON- would have rabbit steak sometimes -PRON- would caribou
this conclude -PRON- foodie field report
the end
how do this show survive in las vegas for more than 10 year and still charge more than $ 100
for such level of entertainment -PRON- would the most pay $ 40
other than penn and teller this be one of the bad show that -PRON- have see in vegas
way too over rat and time waste
no wonder -PRON- be less half fill on a spring break and easter weekend
put -PRON- money on on any cirque show or magic show than on this junk
this be as good as -PRON- get look no further for a dentist
-PRON- be very impressed by dr. cat nyguyen
-PRON- go out of -PRON- way
-PRON- have a situation and -PRON- immediately take care of -PRON- out of -PRON- own time
-PRON- love -PRON- job and -PRON- really show
-PRON- go out of -PRON- way most people will not include -PRON-
service be very important to -PRON- and -PRON- provide outstanding customer service
-PRON- be constantly try to improve -PRON- business
-PRON- only regret be that -PRON- wish -PRON- live in las vegas so -PRON- could only go to pearly whites regularly
okay the food be good and the price be pretty reasonable
-PRON- have a gyro which be amazing -PRON- mom have a chicken parm wrap which be great too
-PRON- fry be not good at all cold
the service be not good
-PRON- be rather empty for a saturday afternoon but very little interaction with -PRON- waitress and the food take a while to be bring out
also -PRON- do not know how often the restaurant be thoroughly clean
look around while wait for food really allow -PRON- to notice how unswept the floor be
overall decent experience
and -PRON- think -PRON- would go again skip the fry
edit
the menu be way too busy
there be entirely too many option which overwhelm the customer
-PRON- think -PRON- should do something about that
what a great cut of steak
get a moscow mule to accompany this and a selection of lobster appetizer
-PRON- wish -PRON- take picture of -PRON- food
great food great people and great view
lisa be serve -PRON- and -PRON- be awesome
definitely -PRON- be come back for breakfast
-PRON- have frequently joes farm grill last week be the first time -PRON- try the coffee shop next door
the selection of item be great
-PRON- be pleasantly surprised to have vegan option
-PRON- vegan bagel be delicious
-PRON- be definitely go back to have this again
the creme cheese replacement spread -PRON- have be outstanding
and the almond and honey make -PRON- perfect
if -PRON- be against use honey that can easily be leave out
only reason for give 4 star and not 5 be that the patio lack enough shade for all the patron
be that -PRON- be 100 degree in the morning some of the table be in full sun without umbrella
-PRON- end up have to move a table around to sit in the 2nd hand shade of another party umbrella
which be not terrible but be that the majority of the seating be outdoors -PRON- get lucky -PRON- could do that
also parking can kind of be a pain with the main lot all the way on the other side of joe 's
the food make -PRON- worth -PRON- though so a plus on have a diverse menu for people with special dietary need
also have a gf bagel option would be nice as well
great service great dr.s and great staff
-PRON- would certainly recommend this place to anyone look to get long term or short term care
high quality pizza
truly wonderful homemade crust
however at $ 12 14 per personal pizza -PRON- be a bit pricey
if -PRON- be not on a budget and look for some wonderful neopolitan style brick oven pizza this -PRON- place
-PRON- be contact by a manager from the signature who finally address -PRON- issue in a professional manner and -PRON- will be give -PRON- another chance as -PRON- previous stay there have all be good
this be a 3.5
the staff here be delightful
helpful prompt and friendly
anything -PRON- need -PRON- either get -PRON- or direct -PRON-
however that be say for the price the hotel be a little run down
not dilapidate but worn and ready for a revamp
the room be not as spacious as -PRON- should be but the tvs be nice ask -PRON- live the coffee bean and tea leaf coffee\/tea -PRON- have in room as well as the shampoo and soap
bed be comfy
the poll be plenty however -PRON- be there whole
-PRON- be really cold out and the hot tub be just a sad situation
a hot tub should be warm enough where -PRON- do not have goosebump while -PRON- sit in -PRON-
-PRON- should also have enough residual heat to get -PRON- back to -PRON- room without totally get hypothermia
-PRON- keep wait for -PRON- to get warm but as soon as -PRON- seem to start that direction the key would shoot in ice cold water
nice when -PRON- be 43 degree outside
would -PRON- stay here again
meh
if the rate be less
for the same price there be nice place around
do -PRON- have a bad experience
no
-PRON- be pleasant and work
-PRON- also suck that the on property restaurant be horrible so that add to the negative part of thing
this be just about the beauty section although -PRON- have have some food from -PRON- hot table and -PRON- be delicious
-PRON- come here after realize that -PRON- have probably be use toxic chemical on -PRON- face and body for year
maybe that be why -PRON- have get the skin of a teen hit puberty
-PRON- could spend hour in here gaze at all the different cream soap and makeup
-PRON- come into the store without a clue as to what -PRON- be after but -PRON- staff be more than helpful and -PRON- end up leave with a few new product in hand
-PRON- overheard one staff member say that -PRON- have tighten restriction on what -PRON- can sell here as far as legitimately natural and organic product go and as -PRON- have recently learn by watch marketplace any company can slap that title on -PRON- product and still contain unsafe ingredient
-PRON- reference cosmeticsdatabase.com for some of the product that -PRON- examine in -PRON- nearly hour long visit
the site list all kind of product and -PRON- ingredient
-PRON- rate how safe a product be discover that useful site through ecoholic
most of the product -PRON- check out get a decent rating except a couple of 4 's low moderate
-PRON- end up purchase a moisturizer by a canadian company call green beaver titter
-PRON- have get really oily skin but want something that -PRON- can safely use under -PRON- eye as well for -PRON- nice set of bag
this cream seem to be pretty decent and -PRON- be pretty cheap
plus support canadian company be a bonus to make -PRON- feel extra good about -PRON-
-PRON- have a good selection of non toxic sunblock and bug repellent too
some can get a bit pricey
but there be some cheap one
-PRON- get a cheap facial sunblock
sure -PRON- make -PRON- look like a ghost when -PRON- first apply -PRON- but a little bit of gruntwork do the trick
-PRON- would love to invest in some makeup there as -PRON- seem to have a good selection but -PRON- have to tighten -PRON- purse string as -PRON- have already purchase shampoo astringent moisturizer bug repellent body cream and pretty much everything else for the body\/face
-PRON- have be to a couple other health store but the staff be not as helpful as -PRON- be here and for people who have no idea where to start
that be definitely a good thing
too hit or miss lately
-PRON- have be go to regularly tony 's for year
unfortunately -PRON- be afraid -PRON- be do
-PRON- be way too expensive when over half the time -PRON- will get food that be clearly be microwave rubbery and unable to chew
-PRON- be a shame because when -PRON- be fresh -PRON- be delicious
those good moment have become too far and few as of late
rat this store 5 star base on the selection of deck of card
whatev -PRON- be look for -PRON- have -PRON-
-PRON- keep find -PRON- write five star review
-PRON- be usually a cranky old codger
but -PRON- have have some really good luck lately
-PRON- be not the first person to rave about davidstea
there be plenty of 4- and 5-star about the queen w. location
but -PRON- feel -PRON- essential to put a pushpin in the map for these guy at yonge and eglinton
from here on in -PRON- be basically reword what other have say about other location
two thing really impress -PRON- about davidstea awesome staff -PRON- deserve the rant
-PRON- be about to embark on
-PRON- walk in with two friend and ten second later there be three shot of tea in front of -PRON- for tasting this be standard practice apparently
what -PRON- appreciate most about the staff be -PRON- passion
-PRON- be not so much willing to help -PRON- find the perfect tea as -PRON- be die to put product in front of -PRON- and share -PRON- wealth of tea knowledge
even better -PRON- be neither cool than -PRON- knowledgeable like the oh so cliche record store music geek nor -PRON- favourite author-(this week)-should be -PRON- favourite author evangelist like the over caffeinat fiction shelver at the big box book broker
-PRON- be not really a tea guy but -PRON- do not matter
the staff make -PRON- shopping experience fun and completely unintimidating by know -PRON- stuff and show an eagerness to help
between two staff run around on -PRON- behalf -PRON- must have sniff about 20 tea before settle on three and -PRON- go in because -PRON- friend want tea not -PRON-
awesome product davidstea have more tea than -PRON- even know exist -PRON- be introduce to mate ma tay which be non caffeinat but have a similar stimulant that is at present drive -PRON- to type at twice -PRON- normal speed the flavour -PRON- get be call jumpy monkey so -PRON- should not be surprised
there be more flavour of more leaf than be worth list just go to http:\/\/www.davidstea.com\/ if -PRON- want to know
-PRON- settle on the tea of the day secret weapon a white tea with licorice and soji berry
ad well as organic raspberry nectar and turn leaf a creamy smell rooibos
-PRON- splurge for the tin $ 2.50 each but -PRON- give an air tight seal and keep -PRON- tea good for up to two year
-PRON- will now save 50 cent whenever -PRON- drop by for a refill
the other option be a bag which be free
either way each tea -PRON- buy come with a label that describe -PRON- flavour and ingredient
very handy
not much of a place for sit -PRON- have a couple seat at the front of the store
still -PRON- do not feel like this be much of a loss although -PRON- do hold -PRON- back from five and a half star

the guest house -PRON- have 10 en suite room that include single double and twin room
-PRON- offer a full scottish breakfast that -PRON- remember hearing be much to -PRON- father 's enjoyment
the female owner of the guest house be very pleasant and -PRON- see -PRON- a couple of time
-PRON- be always ready to engage in conversation and take great care to look after -PRON- guest
with a small capacity and the quality of the guest house this be bind to be a popular place to stay
-PRON- be well worth consider if -PRON- be think of visit this area of edinburgh
-PRON- parent would stay there again and -PRON- count that to be as good a recommendation as any
first experience with this restaurant
-PRON- order the chicken quesadilla fajita style
-PRON- literally have to pick off maybe half of an onion chop into tiny piece
-PRON- love onion but in moderation
-PRON- go in here yesterday afternoon

store be dirty and not to mention -PRON- wait about 7 min to finnaly get -PRON- order due to a mess up on make -PRON- drink
-PRON- would probably recommend this store to young kid who have nothing good to do with -PRON- life
this be consider a fast food joint for a reason and that be to provide fast food
honestly -PRON- and a work buddy come here because crispy bahn mi be close on monday so -PRON- roll the dice
what a hidden gem
-PRON- be an easy tie now but -PRON- can not really compare as this place have -PRON- own flare
-PRON- order the bahn mi special and the green tea bubble tea
the sandwich be amazing the house aoli be fire and a great compliment and the multiple pork deli meat remind -PRON- of grow up in a polish community
the bubble tea be -PRON- first time try milk tea
and -PRON- be impressed
the sandwich could have use a sprig more of cilantro and a couple more jalapeno slice to balance the flavor buy -PRON- would order -PRON- again as be
the tea could have use a little more caffeine but be great
beware as the bubble be high in calorie so that little shake esque drink can add up to 1000 + calorie
fire

even the light radio and alarm can be control by the tablet next to the bed
the room be very spacious and -PRON- have upgrade the lighting inside the room to ensure -PRON- be a tad bright inside
water pressure from the shower be excellent
the big challenge seem to be the desert which make the experience an extremely dry one
numerous request for a room humidifier be merely note
a tub full of water and a wet towel by the vent do help quite a bit
bring a humidifier bottle of water along with throat lozenge to ensure a more comfortable experience
pho tai 14 be great
spring roll 1 be average
thai tea be good
service be fast and efficient
if -PRON- want the full on sonoran mexican food experience this be -PRON- place
everything on the menu be good
-PRON- do the classic chimichangas enchilada taco etc

-PRON- margarita and tequila selection be excellent
food be excellent no doubt
server be quick with the meat which be not hard as the place be more than half empty
-PRON- find -PRON- way too pricey for a sunday lunch and also -PRON- waiter be not very well informed e.g. -PRON- do not mention the senior discount which would have clearly apply to -PRON- parent in law
-PRON- find out later on -PRON- website when -PRON- be too late
-PRON- be a great experience but due to the high price -PRON- will not go back i.e. there be good value for money out there
bring a brand new car cover beyond description with water spot calcium residue dirt sand and so on in short a very dirty car so sad

-PRON- can get a large for $ 5 in chinatown
-PRON- know -PRON- be pricey due to location but still the drink -PRON- get mango black milk tea and strawberry -PRON- be good but probably not with $ 5 in -PRON- opinion
the girl that help -PRON- be really nice
wtfexp be pretty cool
when -PRON- first come upon the restaurant on yelp and bookmark -PRON- the photo do not do -PRON- justice
the restaurant be a little off course from the main street however -PRON- be a pleasant surprise to see how -PRON- be design
the complex look new and the idea of wtfexp be sort of original
if -PRON- have ever be to lee 's sandwiches in chandler then think of how the inside look
however with the wtfexp -PRON- literally have 4 different restaurant in one
the one -PRON- choose be philly affairs
-PRON- forget the name of the cheesesteak -PRON- get however -PRON- have chicken and steak mushroom and onion and cheez
whiz

but very tasty and the french fry season -PRON- use be pretty damn good
-PRON- also have a cool aid station with like 6 different flavor -PRON- get the pink one forget the name lol
the cashier name be khaled
-PRON- be a good kid -PRON- let -PRON- know that -PRON- be kinda overwhelm by all of the food item on the menu
and -PRON- take the time to answer -PRON- question as a newbie there
-PRON- really enjoy the service here and would recommend this spot to anyone in the area look for a fulfilling bite from have a munchie attack or something to that extent
-PRON- have have bad experience with rent vehicle online
so -PRON- be weary of this too
will update when all be say and do
-PRON- shop at kmart only once every several year
-PRON- drive past one and -PRON- get curious because so much time have pass since -PRON- last visit
then -PRON- go inside and hardly find any merchandise that -PRON- like to buy
this time -PRON- buy cat litter and cat food
the line at checkout have only one person in front of -PRON-
the cashier be nice but for some reason -PRON- think that -PRON- husband and -PRON- who be share a cart be ring up separately

-PRON- really do look like poop so -PRON- need to clean that up

so awesome to know -PRON- be eat what the chef be most proud of
-PRON- fiance and -PRON- go here after purchase a yelp deal as -PRON- have drive past the restaurant many time and never make -PRON- in

everything -PRON- would say be average portion be plentiful food be flavorful but nothing really wow -PRON-
have -PRON- not have the yelp deal

with that being say -PRON- will file this restaurant in the would not choose to return but would be fine with someone suggest -PRON- go there section of -PRON- dining rolodex

and -PRON- call these guy for a quote

-PRON- have be a huge fan of maui jim and own several pair
if -PRON- want to protect -PRON- eye and have the perfect shading for outdoor use -PRON- must pay a premium for -PRON-
some people can not justify the expense of premium lens so -PRON- squint in -PRON- $ 1 glass and get no uv protection

-PRON- bring the steak on a hot stone and -PRON- cook -PRON- -PRON-
the sirloin be not that great

there be many different snack pastry that also look delicious but -PRON- be try to cut down on -PRON- sugar intake
the atmosphere of the coffee house be unique artsy and quirky
in a world full of coffee house this one will stand out in -PRON- mind
this park be so cool and gorgeous
-PRON- love the set up all the neat wagon picnic table with -PRON- own barbecue grill the lush grass plant and tree and most importantly the theme

lot of tree line the park and mostly block the view of the street from inside the park
the picnic table cover by the wagon sit in a semi circle with a mini amphitheater in the center

usually pizza be pizza
however that be not the case when -PRON- come to otto 's
-PRON- order the medium rainbow otto for $ 11.99 and cheesy breadstick for $ 4.99
the rainbow come with ham pepperoni green pepper and black olive
-PRON- could have go without the breadstick as -PRON- be mediocre
however -PRON- be especially impressed with the pizza
-PRON- would say otto 's have the good slice in all of arizona
for excellent food the price be very reasonable
plus -PRON- do not charge a delivery fee
-PRON- highly recommend otto 's to anyone look for an exceptional pizza
love this place
-PRON- have be here
2x be now and have great food each time
first -PRON- make -PRON- own and the second -PRON- have a bbq chicken per -PRON- recommendation
-PRON- do not even really like bbq chicken pizza but this be great
can not beat the pricing either
blood orange lemonade be good too but if -PRON- be prone to heartburn then steer clear
-PRON- be very acidic
absolutely the good makeup appointment -PRON- have have
-PRON- always get -PRON- makeup do at mac before a special event -PRON- never disappoint
trinity at the vegas caesars mac store be amazing
-PRON- take -PRON- time and make -PRON- look so sexy if -PRON- like the va va voom
look
-PRON- be -PRON- girl
get the fake eyelash too -PRON- could not tell -PRON- be not -PRON- own
-PRON- boyfriend be very happy with the end result
-PRON- make an appointment but -PRON- can also drop in -PRON- just have to take the risk of the store be too busy
-PRON- have no idea what the other reviewer be complain about these people be probably the 1%s that complain about everything
when -PRON- go there -PRON- just do not do ayce without any notice
-PRON- be so experience but -PRON- taste still ok
the renovation look good but the food be awful
if -PRON- be look for bad food and bad service in a good look buffet this place will work for -PRON-
-PRON- go to the renovated buffet the week -PRON- open
while the food be disappointing there be a few item that be edible and -PRON- think -PRON- show promise
-PRON- go back today and -PRON- could barely find anything worth eat
anything that cost more than a few penny to slop up be remove since -PRON- grand opening
-PRON- raise price but lower -PRON- food quality with the reopen
in just a week food quality have fall dramatically
if -PRON- keep this up -PRON- will just be serve ten version of potato and twenty variation of cabbage and some rice with nothing else soon
instead of crispy fry chicken -PRON- have freeze pre fry chicken wing which be cold soggy and disgusting
instead of a rich oxtail stew -PRON- have dry out roasted sweet potato
the clam and mussel be replace with shell that be pretty much devoid of anything else
-PRON- bbq rib be so over cooked and dry -PRON- be bad than jerky
service be terrible as well
waitress be very nice
but -PRON- could not keep up with all -PRON- table and
-PRON- dish be pile high and sit there throughout the meal
-PRON- be such bad management to invest so much money and effort into create a gorgeous new buffet only to ruin -PRON- by basically serve reheat the cheap frozen food out of some deep discount food warehouse
-PRON- be really look forward to this new buffet and utterly disappointed
-PRON- review may be a bit harsh and overly critical but ii really want management to fix this buffet
there be so much potential to have a destination worthy buffet at the orleans
-PRON- hope management rethink -PRON- strategy and decide -PRON- should do good
-PRON- be hard to do bad
-PRON- go to maison bleue for -PRON- husband 's birthday
-PRON- be seat upstairs by a window which -PRON- enjoy
be 8 month pregnant the table be a little too close together
when -PRON- try to get up and go to the toilet -PRON- be bump into everyone with -PRON- belly
the food be great
everything that -PRON- husband and -PRON- want end up be on the preset 25 pound 3 course menu so -PRON- both go with that and save a few pound
the staff be very attentive and always fill up -PRON- drink glass which do not happen that often in scotland
this be definitely the place to go for a nice romantic meal with some good food
this place be pretty disappointing
try several different item
the salmon mahi and the short rib
both the salmon and the mahi be pretty bland and not worth what -PRON- charge for -PRON-
the short rib be very tender but the sauce -PRON- be in just be not palatable
-PRON- notice that everyone else that get the short rib have not take more than a couple of bite
the lobster bisque and the calamari friend to start be the good dish -PRON- have but -PRON- may have just seem that way because after soup and appetizer the dinner go downhill
2 star go to the entree but since the appetizer be good this place get 3 star
good food odd service
the food be pretty delicious foie gra just melt in -PRON- mouth piglet belly be tender and not overly fatty and the upside down pear cake be very tasty even after a fairly fill meal
-PRON- also pick at -PRON- friend food lamb medallion trio of creme brulee and -PRON- be all very good
now the service at first the waitress be very nice to -PRON- and then all of the sudden with no apparent provocation -PRON- turn into an ice cold b*tch
and half way through the dinner another waitress take over -PRON- table while the first one be just give -PRON- dirty look from a distance
no idea what that be all about
needless to say that make the whole dinner experience very uncomfortable
exclamation salon be decent especially when need a last minute haircut in henderson\/green valley
-PRON- like that -PRON- be not a chain
-PRON- sell good product -PRON- cut be $ 20 and -PRON- be able to get -PRON- in pretty quick next day
ashley cut -PRON- hair and -PRON- be nice
-PRON- have short hair and -PRON- do a pretty good job with listen to what -PRON- want -PRON- hair to look like and ask question
-PRON- have be go to a barber shop lately where all -PRON- do be short man 's hair so -PRON- know go in -PRON- would not be get a clean perfect barber cut
do not go here if that be what -PRON- be look for
this place do a lot of perm and long length hair
one other thing -PRON- do not care for be that the station be not sweep between haircut
the guy hair that have a cut before -PRON- be still on the ground for -PRON- cut
here be -PRON- story on five guy
fry bath in a peanut oil bubble bath will always make -PRON- happy
-PRON- remind -PRON- of sunshine and puppy and all thing that be pure and good in life
five guy use peanut oil and -PRON- be all for that
-PRON- take the advice of a reviewer and get a little guy with cheese and bacon and -PRON- be more than plenty with the fry and drink
peanut while -PRON- wait
-PRON- be a bit amuse by the text on the side of the box warn not to remove from the shop on account of peanut allergy
legal posturing for liability purpose always get -PRON- but good form
-PRON- like that all the topping -PRON- want be include at no additional charge
like mushroom and grill onion and about a dozen other option
that in a way justify the high price because while yeah there be the lamo who just want ketchup most will take advatage of that shiz and pile -PRON- high
yeah
like -PRON- do
the coke fountain be seriously out of star trek
the next generation
-PRON- watch -PRON-
do not judge if -PRON- get the reference -PRON- do too
-PRON- be pretty sure picard get -PRON- earl grey out of the same stinkin machine
touch screen
-PRON- push coke
a dozen new icon come up
would -PRON- like cherry coke lime coke lemon coke orange coke vanilla coke
just coke thank -PRON- add -PRON- citrus the old fashioned way from a piece of citrus
bag be greasy so -PRON- know -PRON- be go to like -PRON-
yeah -PRON- do
go
-PRON- will feel a bit guilty so eat a salad for dinner and run an extra mile
but do -PRON-
wow
just amazing service -PRON- dream come true -PRON- have a nice limo for -PRON- birthday
never never never stay here
this place be a shit hole
a motel 8 would be good
the room have old mismatched furniture from the 80 's with all the wear and tear
the elevator be miss button and the hallway have stain and peel wallpaper and carpet
after a night out and go to bed at 4 a.m. -PRON- be wake up at 7 a.m. with loud ass construction just 50 ft away with bang noise every few second from the 15 story trash shoot
call to get -PRON- room change and call front desk 4 time and no answer just keep ring
call concierge 2 time just to be tell -PRON- will be transfer and transfer again to dead air
finally on -PRON- 7th attempt of call concierge do -PRON- get transfer to front desk to get a room on the quiet side of the hotel
do not be fool by the price even tho $ 100\/night be not cheap and -PRON- be center strip
-PRON- pay $ 45\/night cuz -PRON- have -PRON- player card but there be still a $ 20 resort fee on top of that every night
-PRON- be not worth -PRON-
stay away
-PRON- may just die here from the haunting
-PRON- be a miserable shit hole
this location use to be great
-PRON- frequent the drive thru late and -PRON- be friendly and consistent with fresh food
for the past month or 2 completely different
slow service more interested in stand around talk than service and at 3:50 am -PRON- say breakfast only
-PRON- be suppose to serve the menu until 4 am
skip this location until -PRON- remember what service mean
very disappointing
-PRON- just be not as impressed with this place as -PRON- think -PRON- would be
after peruse -PRON- menu -PRON- figure this would be a home run but sadly be not the case
-PRON- mean the ice cream be fine
but that be kinda the thing -PRON- be just fine
-PRON- be not baskin robbins quality but -PRON- do not taste like the hype be justify
-PRON- do like the selection of candy though
perhaps -PRON- sell -PRON- short by not have the pretzel cone
oh well
perhaps a second visit may be a little more of the true churn experience
a very cosy non big chain coffee house
-PRON- love the decor here -PRON- be modern yet comfortable
nice pastry and loaf selection and good quality espresso drink pricing wise -PRON- be comparable to -PRON- average starbucks
recommend
not only do this place have consistently delicious sub but the staff be always super friendly helpful informative and -PRON- get the feeling -PRON- actually want -PRON- to be there
-PRON- customer service be top notch and -PRON- food be nothing short of fantastic
life long customer here
do not let -PRON- win
of course -PRON- always want to come to a buffet with an empty stomach -PRON- onky make sense
-PRON- be about $ 118.94 for 2 people after tax at dinner time
there be a ton of food to choose from here
-PRON- have all kind of seafood crab leg sea bass shelfish italian food chinese food different meat etc
like any buffet that -PRON- go to some thing be good when -PRON- be fresh instead of how -PRON- be when -PRON- have sit for awhile
-PRON- really enjoy a little bit of everything here really
especially the chili crab
there be a large selection of dessert here all sort of mini cake gelato custard and a fresh crepe station
most of the dessert be good but all of the cheesecake taste like ice
-PRON- would say avoid the cheesecake
overall the atmosphere here be good the food be good and -PRON- would definitely come here again
for the most part -PRON- have have good experience here
the food be always delicious
-PRON- come here a few year when -PRON- guest have a lot of food allergy
the chef actually come out to -PRON- table and write down everything that the -PRON- could not have and what -PRON- could have and make a custom dinner just for -PRON-
and -PRON- be so good that -PRON- be jealous of have something ordinary from the menu
-PRON- have be here on several occasion and try many different dish all be great e.g. bacon crust pork chop steak pasta calamari soup and more
the reason why -PRON- do not get 5 star be that one time both -PRON- guest and -PRON- order the bacon crust pork chop and -PRON- arrive raw right around the bone on both of -PRON- order
do not get -PRON- wrong
-PRON- be still delicious and of course -PRON- do not see -PRON- until -PRON- get to the end of the meal
when -PRON- let the waitress know -PRON- simply apologize and that be -PRON-
-PRON- always give a comment card with every meal so -PRON- fill -PRON- out and let -PRON- know that the pork chop be undercook this time around
-PRON- give -PRON- to the hostess when -PRON- be leave and when -PRON- be wait for the valet to pull the car around the hostess come up to -PRON- to apologize and say that a manager would be in touch with -PRON- shortly to make amend
no one ever follow up
-PRON- would not have expect that anything would come out of a comment card
let -PRON- be realistic
-PRON- be rare but the hostess set the expectation that a manager would address -PRON- and -PRON- be never address
1 principle of any service relate business under promise and over deliver
that clearly do not happen in this case
-PRON- would have probably give -PRON- 3 star but -PRON- food really be very good
and -PRON- have be there several time
-PRON- suppose -PRON- can not be perfect every time
also if -PRON- be a holiday or if -PRON- tell -PRON- that -PRON- be celebrate a special occasion -PRON- will come to -PRON- table to take a picture and mail -PRON- to -PRON-
-PRON- be a nice keepsake and service
-PRON- wife and -PRON- enjoy breakfast this morning
huevos rancheros and fabulous poached egg
love the rice pudding and -PRON- wonderful server convince -PRON- to try the churros
great way to start -PRON- day
-PRON- go to try -PRON- bbt because of the positive review -PRON- hear and maybe -PRON- be because -PRON- arrive later in the evening but -PRON- experience be pretty bad
-PRON- wait in line for more than 15 min to only reach the cashier to say -PRON- have no tapioca or grass jelly
what a disappointment as -PRON- only mainly go for -PRON- flavour tapioca
-PRON- order the garden milk tea and alley trio milk tea
upon wait for -PRON- drink -PRON- tell -PRON- that -PRON- do not have enough black tea for -PRON- alley trio milk tea and would replace -PRON- with royal number 9
-PRON- could see the other guest who wait just as long as -PRON- do frustrate that a few of -PRON- specialty drink be unavailable because of -PRON- lack of black tea and tapioca
however -PRON- do enjoy -PRON- royal number 9 as -PRON- have a good fruity flavour to -PRON-
-PRON- garden milk tea taste a bit creamy to -PRON-
and -PRON- be pretty sure -PRON- be because -PRON- be run out of black tea lol
-PRON- will be back during an early evening time to try -PRON- drink again with tapioca
one of the good spot in the area -PRON- have great flavor
-PRON- play pool endlessly the music be always great and -PRON- service be good
-PRON- never need to ask for anything -PRON- be on top of -PRON- hookah
check -PRON- out
be a patron at rubio be for a long time this one include
this evening have -PRON- bad experience ever
-PRON- be short staffed which create a an inordinate wait 25 minute for two taco b rude\/hurri staff c cold food which end up make -PRON- sick though -PRON- could have just be the unsanitary way -PRON- appear to be make d virtually empty salsa bar e very dirty dining area\/table f wet tray -PRON- food be set on to -PRON- credit the shift manager have to keep run back and forth between the counter and the back throw on the plastic glove and make the food then run out to the counter take the glove off and deliver the food and g angry impatient customer
-PRON- be enough to seriously think about never go there again give the number of local establishment that serve just as good\/better food
and now that rubio 's price be so high -PRON- can not think of a really good reason to go back
sometimes -PRON- feel like -PRON- have try all the place in the east valley but this be by far -PRON- favorite
service be fast and consistently good while the price be right also
the technician be creative in -PRON- nail art and even a standard manicure be do well enough that -PRON- be not ruin by the time -PRON- get home
-PRON- go here last weekend after crave some burger
the menu look a little confusing mainly bc the place be so small and -PRON- seem like there be so many option
-PRON- each get a build a burger where -PRON- can choose two topping for free
-PRON- get mushroom and bacon and -PRON- boyfriend get green chile and bacon
-PRON- also get chili fry and a chocolate milk shake
-PRON- be soooo good
there be this place in berkeley back home call nation 's that have awesome burger as well and -PRON- be big
but -PRON- be more expensive and -PRON- can not get the topping for the price at lenny 's
-PRON- meal with reg fry and a large drink with a burger and -PRON- topping be only $ 5.99
-PRON- be very tasty and -PRON- be stuff
the chili fry be good than nation 's too bc -PRON- have more chunk of meat
-PRON- also like that -PRON- fry have this yummy paprika garlic salt on -PRON- -PRON- be so good
this place be a scam
they do not measure my house
-PRON- be in the market to replace the carpet throughout -PRON- home
oscar come on behalf of carpets galore to provide a free estimate for new carpeting
-PRON- ask prior to the appointment for -PRON- to bring carpet sample -PRON- bring nothing
-PRON- happen to have sample from home depot and lowes -PRON- swear -PRON- could beat -PRON- estimate
as -PRON- watch -PRON- walk thru -PRON- home -PRON- be obvious -PRON- lack tool bring by guy from both hd and lowes to measure the room in -PRON- home
this guy eye ball each room and leave
when oscar call with -PRON- estimate -PRON- refuse to provide a square footage for -PRON- home because -PRON- do not have one and the carpet -PRON- swear -PRON- could price match be now private label and -PRON- need to visit -PRON- showroom choose carpet
-PRON- ask -PRON- provide -PRON- an estimate base on the close thing -PRON- refuse
-PRON- goal be to get -PRON- in that store and upsell
scam scam scam
but how can -PRON- trust anyone who fail to measure the carpet in it
stay away
michelle be excellent at the bar -PRON- be also the new manager get an issue talk to -PRON-

-PRON- have go to this cozy family run restaurant countless time over the year
-PRON- be a hidden gem in the yonge and eglinton area where place tend to come and go and price be often high
this spot have stay the test of time with enormous value and excellent food
-PRON- must have the margaritas-
-PRON- be excellent
for food -PRON- be hard for -PRON- to choose as -PRON- love -PRON- entire menu
but if -PRON- be look for something unique to traditional mexican food -PRON- would suggest that -PRON- mole chicken be excellent
-PRON- love everything and -PRON- can not go wrong
one reason why -PRON- love -PRON- be because -PRON- do not eat cilantro and -PRON- do not give -PRON- any grief about -PRON- be essential to mexican cuisine -PRON- just omit -PRON- for -PRON-
-PRON- be a small place
so be prepare for some wait time while -PRON- prepare -PRON- delicious meal to order have a margarita enjoy
-PRON- love the staff
1st time visit this doctor and look forward to come back
the equipment be very high tech and efficient -PRON- easily book an appointment the staff be very knowledgeable and price be definitely not outrageous
-PRON- truly love this place
my problem be my wisdom tooth
-PRON- be in a lot of pain
and they easily accomadt around my hectic work schedule
gear have be around for aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagesss
from the outside the big yellow with blue letter really hurt -PRON- eye but the pain just pull -PRON- closer where inside -PRON- heal -PRON-
gears be a fully operational bike snowboard and spinning cycle shop
at the age of 17 kevin wallace start gears in 1988 as a little bike shop in clarkson train station on clarkson road
ever since then the place have be pass down to the family
today gears be one of the large bicycle retailer in canada
-PRON- carry some big name of product and will do servicing and maintenance help to get -PRON- equipment fit
whilst all this be happen at the front in the back on the far leave side there stand a door
nothing special about this door
except there be a spinning class go on
not many people know this usually surprise -PRON- friend when -PRON- take -PRON- to a bike shop for a spinning class but -PRON- be a legit indoor spinning class
-PRON- come here upon a recommendation to see what spinning be all about
-PRON- bike experience be limit to cruising as a teenager
so really -PRON- have have no formal training on proper bike mechanic etc the most awkward thing be to walk in with -PRON- workout gear ready for a gym type of place and noticing -PRON- be a store
luckily the staff be nice enough to guide -PRON- to the back
-PRON- just hand the cash flat and walk in
by the end of the class -PRON- like -PRON- enough to try out a few more class
normally -PRON- love to be outside in the summer
so -PRON- have mentally bookmark this as an alternative during winter when -PRON- need to sweat out all the holiday guilt
layout be standard medium size with about 25 bike and -PRON- be own exit so -PRON- do not have to walk through the front of the store all sweaty
-PRON- really do think this one through
-PRON- can buy package or just drop in for the spinning class
there be a schedule online with specific instructor
-PRON- do have to call ahead and reserve a spot
$ 10.00 for the drop in no tax
or -PRON- can buy a card for 15 class at $ 9 per class or -PRON- can pre pay for 30 class at $ 8 class
the card do not expire so the card just get put away and punch in when -PRON- come in
the room be a decent size with a massive monitor at the front where the instructor be position
the rest of the room have a ladder type of feel
there be speaker around the room where -PRON- can hear the instructor over the music
the music be usually loud so -PRON- can request to have -PRON- tone down
every level have row of bike so -PRON- can clearly see the front even if -PRON- take position at the back of the room
the bike be all maintain well and -PRON- will give -PRON- towel if -PRON- do not have any
there be ton of regular that come in and people move at -PRON- own pace
-PRON- suggest try the different instructor because -PRON- all have -PRON- own style of workout(intensity and most importantly -music
somehow -PRON- can not take work out seriously if -PRON- be heavy metal or anything with taylor swift
the parking be an issue there be street parking but -PRON- will have to try and park and walk to the place
-PRON- really like the atmosphere here and usually enjoy -PRON- workout
-PRON- do not have to be a pro which be what -PRON- really like
-PRON- can come in and just follow the instruction or go at -PRON- own pace to build up stamina for the more intense class
make sure to account for the high volume traffic of this area
if -PRON- do come late -PRON- miss the warm up
and -PRON- will regret -PRON-
for the busy class -PRON- will not be allow to go in and -PRON- remember -PRON- name if -PRON- have not call to cancel -PRON- spot
eeek
give -PRON- a spin
xoxo m.
if -PRON- be tired of spend $ 100 a meal at the wynn\/encore then this be a great place
pizza and salad be basic really good food
-PRON- can sit outside and have a great view
price be really reasonable for what -PRON- get
great place to eat when -PRON- be look for a pizza to help -PRON- hangover
-PRON- be over this target store
-PRON- be single out every time -PRON- go at night
the undercover security guard constantly follow -PRON- around and -PRON- be uncomfortable
when -PRON- catch -PRON- see -PRON- -PRON- pretend to be on -PRON- phone or check out the baby clothe
-PRON- feel uncomfortable every time
and -PRON- be not worth go anymore
-PRON- be a woman
-PRON- do not know what the hell -PRON- want so -PRON- browse for hour
but -PRON- guess that be too suspicious for -PRON-
-PRON- literally walk out and forget to buy several item -PRON- be plan on get but -PRON- just want to get out of there
-PRON- have never feel profiled like that before

nice fresh ingredient prepare while -PRON- wait
the bacon be the extra thick cut and the egg and hash be cook exactly as -PRON- order

-PRON- could eat that lamb burger everyday the gyro be big than -PRON- head and cut with lightning from zeus -PRON-
-PRON- be pretty sure -PRON- get real greek goddess in the back roll the grape leave too
-PRON- personally do not mind -PRON- a cash only establishment -PRON- think that give -PRON- a more old country feel
plus if -PRON- enjoy a bottle of wine with dinner or -PRON- just like to party -PRON- have a byob policy
-PRON- feel silly review a chain however this location be delicious
the restaurant -PRON- could use a touch up though
maybe -PRON- because every time -PRON- have be in there -PRON- just after a dinner rush but about 3 time in a row every table be dirty and the place be a little messy
the staff be kind though and the food be always consistent
-PRON- will always return
these guy be really great 3 or 4th visit now

what a wonderful show music skit interactivity joke -PRON- be all there while -PRON- do not say a word
go see -PRON-
let -PRON- start off by say that -PRON- do love bodega
-PRON- have send a lot of friend there
to -PRON- this place be perfect for a date girl night out engagement anniversary etc etc
-PRON- think the food be good and -PRON- just love the atmosphere
however -PRON- rate -PRON- two star
the last time -PRON- be there two week ago -PRON- server just destroy all love -PRON- have for this place
first of all -PRON- want the lounge area but -PRON- be not available
the guy at the host station say to -PRON- -PRON- can seat -PRON- at one of the nearby table
-PRON- claim that -PRON- would be good to -PRON-
-PRON- will not say the server name but -PRON- be the service manager
-PRON- seem sincere so -PRON- sit
once -PRON- sit down and -PRON- be obvious -PRON- be there to get appetizer only -PRON- do not seem pleased
-PRON- keep ask -PRON- if -PRON- want to order anything else
how many time must -PRON- say no
-PRON- order the calamari which come with a wasabi honey sauce
-PRON- ask for just a side of honey to eat with the calamari
-PRON- tell -PRON- that -PRON- do not have any
-PRON- say the menu say that -PRON- mix the wasabi with honey
then -PRON- inform -PRON- that -PRON- have -PRON- but -PRON- be raw honey
-PRON- do not realize that -PRON- be another type of honey
then -PRON- be as if -PRON- be an inconvenience to -PRON- to get the honey
why argue with -PRON- about the honey
just get -PRON-
as dinner go on -PRON- just get increasingly rude through -PRON- action and speech
however -PRON- decide to give -PRON- the benefit of the doubt and ask how -PRON- night be go
-PRON- be train 3 ppl and have final the next day
so -PRON- figure -PRON- attitude be base on stress
-PRON- decide to leave -PRON- alone
that be until -PRON- be time to go
mind -PRON-
-PRON- be four of -PRON-
-PRON- put all -PRON- check on one
-PRON- ask if -PRON- could split -PRON- which -PRON- do not like
once -PRON- split -PRON- and bring back the check -PRON- say people do not usually ask for split check
-PRON- do not understand why -PRON- say that but immediately after -PRON- pay and -PRON- sit for a bit and when -PRON- say a bit not even 5 minute
-PRON- proceed to clear the table and when -PRON- say clear -PRON- remove everything the water -PRON- be still drink the plate of fry -PRON- friend be still eat from and fail to ask if -PRON- still want -PRON- to the light candle
-PRON- be very clear that -PRON- be ready for -PRON- to go
so -PRON- stand up not even a second later -PRON- come and start maneuver around -PRON- to set the table back up and even bump into -PRON- girlfriend while do -PRON-
the follow monday -PRON- speak to the general manager and tell -PRON- everything that happen
-PRON- claim that -PRON- be go to call -PRON- back and never do
-PRON- be over that but -PRON- will say this
-PRON- still believe the food be good and -PRON- absolutely love the atmosphere but the way -PRON- be treat be a turn off
-PRON- also hurt because -PRON- love that place
if -PRON- want to go then -PRON- say go but if -PRON- get that server -PRON- pray that -PRON- be kind to -PRON- than -PRON- be to -PRON- and -PRON- friend
great happy hour
most of the staff be friendly
beautiful decor\/ambience inside
mozzarella tempura be unique and delicious here
-PRON- have be go to salt creek home and office for the last 5 year every time -PRON- need furniture
-PRON- have a great variety of style and quality to offer and the service have always be top notch
this be a family own business not the big box follow -PRON- around the store next salesperson up let -PRON- introduce -PRON- to -PRON- manager furniture shopping experience
the person -PRON- work with in the decision making process be the same person -PRON- pay
unlike other furniture store where -PRON- turn -PRON- over to the accounting counter to pay and the accounting people bash the sale people out loud
-PRON- furniture always arrive as promise and have always be in perfect condition
-PRON- know when -PRON- be excited to get -PRON- new furniture -PRON- be easy to get excited and hear the early possible date but with a little patience and realization that quality take time -PRON- end up with the amazing piece -PRON- hand pick
salt creek home and office be -PRON- go to furniture store and will continue to be
everyone come try the homemade pumpkin empanada -PRON- be to die for
-PRON- favorite dish be a green chicken enchilada with a fry egg right on top delicious
also a or g margarita be the perfect drink after a long and stressful day
oh bomberos -PRON- so want to like -PRON- and -PRON- let -PRON- down
-PRON- live just down the street from this restaurant
and -PRON- would hear -PRON- be dog friendly
so -PRON- want to check out -PRON- patio before bring -PRON- pup
come in on a friday evening for happy hour with a few friend and -PRON- be promptly seat on the patio
the server be very friendly and informative when -PRON- come to the various wine
-PRON- initially enjoy the service and the wine -PRON- order but then -PRON- all go downhill
-PRON- order a few bruschetta board and a sandwich -PRON- just want some food to snack on while -PRON- enjoy -PRON- wine
then -PRON- wait
and wait
and wait
and wait some more
okay -PRON- get the point
at first -PRON- be content to have a few glass of wine and take -PRON- time especially because -PRON- be a friday night
and -PRON- understand that restaurant be busy on the weekend
finally -PRON- have to hunt down -PRON- server after -PRON- would wait about an hour for -PRON- bruschetta to come
and -PRON- ask -PRON- what be up
-PRON- be polite of course and -PRON- tell -PRON- that the kitchen be busy and -PRON- would be ready when -PRON- be ready
-PRON- be not nearly as apologetic as -PRON- think -PRON- should have be give the wait
-PRON- end up wait over an hour and a half for some melt cheese on bread
-PRON- be okay -PRON- guess but after that wait -PRON- would have have to be out of this world for -PRON- to forgive the delay
-PRON- do not think -PRON- will be return because the kitchen have difficulty manage to push out food which be too bad because -PRON- really want to become a regular at this place the menu look awesome if only -PRON- could get the food out to -PRON- in under two hour don't waste -PRON- valuable time
there be good wine bar in town such as postino and cheuvront that offer much more efficient service
-PRON- just walk out after wait 20 minute to be acknowledge
-PRON- waitress with long red hair and sparkley eyeshadow who seem very altered could not even communicate with -PRON-
-PRON- make -PRON- repeat -PRON- order several time walk away for about 10 minute and then come back and make -PRON- reorder
-PRON- then get up and walk out without anyone noticing or caring
sorry
will not be return soon
amazing and very comfortable new juice bar with rest drink and vegan option for breakfast
-PRON- do not quite find out what the hype be about this place
that be why -PRON- go there because quite frankly -PRON- do not like hot dog -PRON- just want to see if -PRON- be as good as everyone say
-PRON- love the build -PRON- own concept and all of the topping sound great
the hot dog just do not taste quite right
-PRON- do not think there be anything wrong with -PRON- but -PRON- do not taste right
-PRON- eat all of the topping and leave most of the dog and bun
-PRON- also order tot with pimento mac cheese on top
the tot be great
overly greasy but that be how people like -PRON- -PRON- guess
the menu be self explanatory
-PRON- pick which dog -PRON- want all beef or veggie and select unlimited topping which include all kind of sauce meat egg veggie pickle stuff etc
same with tot or fry -PRON- can top -PRON- with whatever -PRON- want
-PRON- love the extra dipping sauce
-PRON- have a great beer selection
-PRON- do not order a drink but -PRON- have several beer on tap too
and a huge bar
-PRON- kind of a hole in the wall place but -PRON- be update and have somewhat of a trendy feel to -PRON-
-PRON- do have a small parking lot across the road and some street parking nearby
the price be right
$ 6 for a dog $ 3.50 for tots\/frie a couple extra dollar for select topping on each
great outside patio area
good margarita but mediocre food and very poor service from waitstaff
drink at the bar be great bartender be wonderful
once -PRON- be seat at -PRON- table -PRON- all go downhill
waitress be not friendly not helpful borderline rude
ie come and ask -PRON- if -PRON- be all do eat -PRON- food have not even be deliver yet
-PRON- take the order beyond odd
several similar thing happen through the the evening
wait forever for entree
food be cold and bland once deliver salad deliver without dress
great place to come for drink and appetizer but stick with the bartender and skip the table service
and this be a week night
the veggie burger here be ok -PRON- enjoy the appetizer more
-PRON- have cheese stick and fry pickle
the atmosphere be interesting mocking faux retro soviet culture
-PRON- guess -PRON- need to explain the two star if -PRON- go to a place that specialize in burger and -PRON- offer a veggie burger
-PRON- expect -PRON- to be something memorable not two garden burger in a large bun that -PRON- can get pretty much anywhere else
two pizza place arrive in this area of urbana recently- rosati 's and manolo 's
while -PRON- have not eat through the amazing range of item manolo 's offer -PRON- be confident manolo 's be the good of the two
pizza place be ubiquitous on college campus so -PRON- be never too excited when one spring up
manolos set -PRON- apart by have empanda which be an excellent alternative to pizza
-PRON- have several type range from the more authentic spicy san telmo carne to flame potato
the three type -PRON- try be tasty and the pastry be puffy and soft
-PRON- be perfect for an on the go snack since -PRON- can easily be eat while walk
as for the pizza
the cheese pizza -PRON- try be good and have a nice crust
hands down the good pizza there and the reason for the recently add extra star be the fresh basil and mozzarella
-PRON- have -PRON- with some friend and -PRON- all agree -PRON- be top notch
-PRON- be fragrant from the very fresh basil and the cheese stand out as be so much good than regular pizza cheese
specialty pizza be a little bizarre
the one -PRON- try creamy chicken gorgonzola be san red sauce
-PRON- be not bad but -PRON- be like some cheese chicken spinach and good portabellas on dough
more like upscale breadstick than pizza
make sure the description say -PRON- have red sauce if -PRON- be look for something traditional
ditto the other reviewer-
-PRON- make -PRON- food
surprisingly enough this be actually unusual
many restaurant buy pre make item from big company but here at manolos -PRON- can see -PRON- roll the dough for all the pizza and empanada
delivery be slow and expensive
pick up be the good option
-PRON- get the bacon cheeseburger and the kid friendly mac and cheese and would totally go back again
the mac and cheese be probably the good -PRON- have ever have
service be prompt and friendly
would recommend 100
so
-PRON- be give this place a low rate because of the people who work here
not the selection or produce\/product
in fact -PRON- adore this store -PRON- have such a large selection or natural gluten free vegetarian organic item
-PRON- have not be to a good organic grocery store in the city
namely the big carrot
-PRON- literally go to this store twice a week
there a few trick that -PRON- can learn about this location too that could save -PRON- some money
specifically -PRON- have a discount rack in between the ice cream section and soda section
usually there be a few good find
for example there be maybe 15 box of kid gluten free cereal
the downside be definitely the staff
-PRON- have have experience with a good number of -PRON- that have leave a bad taste
the checker can be impatient and judgmental
take for example if -PRON- card do not work the first time -PRON- be not understand but annoy that -PRON- be waste -PRON- time
-PRON- have have this happen with two separate cashier
sarah be one of -PRON-
also the old staff\/cashier seem to greet people with anger and annoyance rather than cheer
the other distasteful experience be -PRON- hear one of the -PRON- assume senior staff member get angry at\/belittl an employee in the middle of the store for shelve thing incorrectly
but again -PRON- be the same attitude of judgment
-PRON- tell do not just correct the employee -PRON- say why do not -PRON- take the afternoon off as discipline
first of all if a suspension be issue this should not be do in front of customer
then the senior employee continue to ask question design to confuse the employee
the whole thing seem in poor manner
so go for the item not the staff
impeccable and friendly service
-PRON- cappuccino be perfect and the croissant be heat up very nicely
closed
2014
go there for dinner last night with friend and -PRON- three year old
great place for kid
good menu and game for little one
cool hippie vibe
kiddo have peanut butter homemade jam sandwich on soft wheat bread
very good
homemade chip good but greasy
-PRON- have blacken chicken alfredo
very good but really spicy
salad and sandwich be a hit but many choice be fry like the monte cristo so beware those who watch cholesterol
-PRON- have be here many time and will keep come back
can not go wrong with any of the donut
-PRON- love the glaze twist
this be a great place to find diverse food and see different thing
if -PRON- be any type of asian this be the store for -PRON-
-PRON- have everything -PRON- could imagine
-PRON- only give this 4 out of 5 because the staff can not speak english and -PRON- be annoying
but -PRON- also have a food court and the food be great if -PRON- like hong kong style food
if -PRON- like normal american chinese food then -PRON- will not like this
have -PRON- catfish platter yesterday and enjoy -PRON- a lot
-PRON- new favorite thing to order
-PRON- have not have a bad meal from this spot yet
-PRON- love all -PRON- sauce also
from -PRON- meat to -PRON- side to -PRON- sweet tea amazing
the employee be a pleasure
ask for a local discount if -PRON- have a nevada id
-PRON- love -PRON- so much -PRON- bout the family pass
-PRON- purchase come with admittance to the park and the museum
there be so much to do there
-PRON- like the exhibit but -PRON- favorite part be the landscape for hiking and walking
-PRON- wife and -PRON- spend 4 hour walk all the trail
-PRON- have special event go on every month
worth every penny
what -PRON- like about holsteins be the combination of atmosphere unique burger and the outrageously indulgent shake
-PRON- have have good burger elsewhere but -PRON- be pretty good
super crisp yet soft interior fry well -PRON- know what -PRON- mean and fresh side salad
but the crazy thing -PRON- order be the cookies and cream shake
whoa
get ready for a calorie bomb like eat 4 packet of energy gel top off with pinnacle vodka and ice cream
-PRON- feel so guilty but could not stop drink the thing plus -PRON- give -PRON- extra in a stainless steel mix cup
-PRON- actually take -PRON- to go make the 106 deg vegas heat tolerable
mmmm mmmm good
the sushi roll here be
t a
s t y.
everything -PRON- taste be yummy but what stick out to -PRON- the most be -PRON- rock and roll series which come roll in a cucumber sheet
this be a first for -PRON- and have now become a new favorite
the bay area have a good selection of sushi but now -PRON- be on a new hunt for cucumber roll sushi
yes -PRON- be that good
the food be well prepared
definitely good
however portion be quite small and take a while
say excellent would be push -PRON-
the reason for 2 star service and ambiance
-PRON- have a groupon gift and as soon as -PRON- waitress know that -PRON- immediately feel judge
-PRON- express an audible sigh when -PRON- do not order wine
-PRON- do take -PRON- order but after that the water guy deal with -PRON- for the rest of the time
-PRON- be beyond clear -PRON- be not worth -PRON- time
-PRON- be cram in a corner -PRON- be very loud
the waiter for the bar\/count behind -PRON- keep hit -PRON- as -PRON- serve
-PRON- actually even stick a plate into -PRON- hair at one point
-PRON- be that close of quarter
after the meal another knock the water glass off the table -PRON- be so claustrophic
-PRON- be not there for sunday supper which i understand to be even crazy
-PRON- be just regular dinner service with half the place empty
the complimentary amuse bouche cotton candy and take home treat be very nice
food be good but the people and uncomfortableness of -PRON- will keep -PRON- from come back
hilton atop a office building sorry can not be 4 star but -PRON- be unique in a couple of way like the pool in winter be amazing and warm -PRON- have 5 foot indoor and than u swim under to the outdoor pool with ice cold wind outside -PRON- smoke up 10 high -PRON- look and feel like ur in a kettle delicious
the hallway have concrete design wall with huge mahogany door look a little like an underground kgb office the room r regular with all hilton amenity
food be good
the service be great
-PRON- wait for a shuttle to pick -PRON- up after -PRON- meal to take -PRON- back to resort and -PRON- take forever
the waitress who be clearly busy keep check on -PRON- and bring -PRON- out a drink while -PRON- be wait
very thoughtful
-PRON- feel very fortunate that -PRON- live across the street from this ahwatukee pizza bistro
-PRON- make wonderful pie -PRON- take out from here once a week
the waitron be attentive and the pizza be ready in 20 minute
-PRON- recommend the hawaiian ham pepperoni and pineapple the flaumbay pepperoni green bell pepper garlic and pineapple or the raspotle chicken roast red bell pepper raspberry chipotle sauce and a choice of feta or goat cheese\/no mozzarella cheese
the crust be thin but sweet and chewy
-PRON- make a wonderful tomato sauce that add to the taste of the fresh veggie and meat
-PRON- would say that one go to item here for -PRON- be the compost cookie -PRON- unique with chocolate chip pretzel coffee grind and be surprisingly tasty
the crack pie be essentially a butter tart the blueberry cookie be a bit sweet for -PRON- liking the birthday truffle be like a dense cake
nothing that would make -PRON- justify a special visit here
other than the compost cookie
lot to like about this restaurant
go there for -PRON- friday fish and chip special
menu look really good

-PRON- look at -PRON- funny when -PRON- bring out the pitcher of sangri and -PRON- ask for a straw
-PRON- be a little sweet but have a great brandy kick
-PRON- stop at all of -PRON- for a pitcher and a bowl of lobster bisque
-PRON- wish -PRON- could mass produce that stuff and in the winter -PRON- could freeze -PRON- and skate on -PRON- and then in the spring when -PRON- melt -PRON- could eat -PRON-
sooooooo good
such a great and under appreciate imo place in the area

update 1st
-PRON- want to sincerely thank the management at square cafe -PRON- respond to -PRON- review quickly and with concern
-PRON- also provide -PRON- with a gift card to try again which -PRON- look forward to do in the near future
more update to come
original too bougie to bear
that be -PRON- current take on the square café
when -PRON- come to food -PRON- do not mind spend money
but when -PRON- walk away have spend $ 40 for two fair breakfast well that be too much
such be -PRON- experience on saturday
-PRON- arrive around 11 a.m. and expect to wait
the wait be not too bad and once -PRON- be seat at the bar the service be fine though a bit snooty
-PRON- order an orange juice and breakfast burrito and jonathan d. order the pumpkin pancakes with a side of sausage
the orange juice be small enough that -PRON- could have obliterate -PRON- in one gulp and -PRON- sausage be so pathetic look -PRON- be hilarious
the main course be decent but in this city of endless brunch possibility decent no longer cut -PRON-
-PRON- think square be once the bastion of brunch in an otherwise brunchless town but have fail to keep up with the incredible offering -PRON- city now enjoy
sorry but overit
-PRON- just love -PRON- here
warm friendly and what be not to like about cheese and pickle
perfect place for after work relax with friend
decent wine cheese and meat platter
reasonable price friendly service
good sign
absolutely no idea whether -PRON- have wi fi
-PRON- have a very positive experience with dose move this morning
the mover call -PRON- an hour before the schedule time let -PRON- know -PRON- be 15 min away and available if -PRON- want to start early
since -PRON- have prepare the night before -PRON- be ready to go more than happy to get -PRON- do asap
the move be seamless and efficiently complete which be really all -PRON- can ask for
-PRON- originally find dose on yelp and be hop -PRON- would live up to -PRON- reputation which -PRON- most certainly do
if or more likely when -PRON- move again there be no doubt -PRON- would use dose move
-PRON- would gladly recommend -PRON- for anyone look for dependable mover at a reasonable price
come for game night and be pretty underwhelmed
-PRON- do have some pretty decent special for appetizer during the monday night football game though -PRON- will give -PRON- that
-PRON- order the mash potato bite pretzel bite and steak nachos
all be pretty standard bar food fare nothing really to write home about
but -PRON- be not bad either
-PRON- think there be only one server in the whole joint
so -PRON- never get a refill on -PRON- drink
and -PRON- have to look for -PRON- to get the check at the end when -PRON- be time for -PRON- to leave
one and do for -PRON-
great hotel with wonderful decoration that have not be overrun with the cigarette smell many other vegas hotel have be
-PRON- have a suite that overlook the strip and one of the good view -PRON- have ever have stay in vegas
however -PRON- expect a little bit more for have a suite such as the availability of hot water
call room service and -PRON- want -PRON- to pay $ 5 for hot water why not have a hot water pot in the room already
also get charge full price even for be a hotel guest to use the encore spa when other hotel give hotel guest $ 5 10 off at the very least
this be still one of -PRON- favorite hotel however just for sheer convenience since -PRON- house the good club in vegas such as encore beach club xs and surrender
when -PRON- be stay here -PRON- feel like these club be in -PRON- backyard since -PRON- just have to go down the elevator before walk to the club
-PRON- be a bit difficult to get to other part of vegas since encore be at the very end of the strip right before -PRON- get into old las vegas
so if -PRON- be plan on go anywhere else on the strip be prepare for long walk or slow travel down las vegas blvd
pretty standard in and out burger
only thing different be the location
-PRON- can be a bit tricky to get to depend on where -PRON- be come from
just aim for the costco and -PRON- should be able to figure -PRON- out
just finish a 5 night stay and overall -PRON- have get no complaint
whether -PRON- be a couple group of party goer or family the elara will impress -PRON-
-PRON- like the fact that this be a non smoking + no casino hotel
this be a clean and well maintain hotel
the pool be awesome
do not have much of an issue find a spot to tan or hangout in the pool
during winter month the pool do close at 6
this be a surprise initially but when -PRON- see the pool cover in shade -PRON- understand why -PRON- do this
do not bother -PRON-
drink and food be obviously overprice at the pool but -PRON- pay for convenience
after read hundred of review -PRON- request a room as high as possible and end up with a 29th floor one bedroom
-PRON- have a very cool 8 ft projector and a great sound system
no ipod connector
kitchen be fine
as for location ignore all the ppl complain how -PRON- be off the strip
with a short 5 minute walk through the mall -PRON- be on the strip face the bellagio
in fact -PRON- would suggest stay here just be slightly away from the madness
-PRON- be perfect for pre partying or just simply relax with -PRON- partner or family
-PRON- honestly would not want to stay anywhere else the next time -PRON- return to vegas
clean staff be great
concierge be friendly and helpful
look forward to return to the elara
-PRON- typically hate go to mexican restaurant because -PRON- usually leave thinking that -PRON- could have make good mexican food at home but this place totally make -PRON- feel like -PRON- be at home eat -PRON- own homemade food
-PRON- guacamole be delicious the bean be so good taco be fry perfectly and not greasy
-PRON- husband have the chile rellenos and enchilada and love -PRON-
-PRON- son have the fideo and quesadilla -PRON- say -PRON- dinner be the good :d -PRON- favorite be the sopa de fideo
this be the first restaurant -PRON- have be to that offer -PRON- in -PRON- menu
and -PRON- taste totally homemade and be incredibly delicious
also the service be awesome probably the good -PRON- have have in a long time
waiter be friendly -PRON- drink and chips\/dip be never empty and -PRON- make sure to check in with -PRON- pretty often
highly recommend this place
will definitely come back next time -PRON- be in vegas
-PRON- live in the area near retro bakery
-PRON- stop in a couple time for cupcake
-PRON- try 4 or 5 different flavor
-PRON- be ok
way too sweet for -PRON- liking
all -PRON- cake taste pretty much the same
the super sweet buttercream be what have the different flavor
-PRON- have have good
but -PRON- service be great
very nice people and very helpful
turned my hair from dark into a golden diahrrea color
please save -PRON- time and money and go elsewhere
-PRON- come in here hop to go light and the hair stylist say that -PRON- will be able to go blonde in one try and two at most
to keep -PRON- short -PRON- dump bleach in -PRON- hair twice put -PRON- under the dryer with bleach in -PRON- hair burn -PRON- scalp with second degree burn and leave -PRON- hair into a color that resemble golden hershey squirt
and in the end -PRON- and the salon still have the audacity to charge -PRON- almost $ 300.00 for completely mess up -PRON- hair
waste of money waste of hair go to waste waste of time
avoid this
place
at all cost
do not write a review in september like -PRON- should have
now -PRON- be go to
-PRON- have live in -PRON- house for 18 year and in that time have have to have -PRON- main sewer line snake due to clog about 5 time
and always the first time do the trick
-PRON- call lawson family plumbing base on review september 7th because -PRON- have clog again
-PRON- be after hour but someone arrive within the timeframe give to -PRON-
the cost to come out after hour to snake -PRON- line be over $ 300
-PRON- negotiate -PRON- down about $ 100 and the guy snake -PRON- line say -PRON- find tampon
ok great
-PRON- tell -PRON- daughter to stop put -PRON- down the toilet and -PRON- have from that point forward
on september 11th -PRON- have to come out again for the same issue
after snake the drain and put a camera down this time the guy say there be more tampon and scold -PRON- a bit on the receipt email to -PRON- that -PRON- have be advise not to do that the first time
hello
maybe the guy -PRON- send out should have do the job
right the first time
fast forward to november 25th line be clog again
-PRON- call lawson plumbing at about 1015 pm because -PRON- advertisement indicate -PRON- be 24 hour
and -PRON- be think this be -PRON- opportunity to make -PRON- right
as of this review -PRON- have not get a call and -PRON- be be almost 12 hour
be -PRON- guy afraid -PRON- be go to have to work a little harder this time to do what should have be do initially
-PRON- be beyond pissed
-PRON- see all these glowing review but bottom line be if -PRON- be in an emergency situation as -PRON- be currently look elsewhere
not worth the money -PRON- will soak out of -PRON- for a crappy job
excellent service and food
-PRON- go on a weeknight close to midnight there be probably only 3 4 table with customer
-PRON- have a young girl as -PRON- server and -PRON- be excellent
-PRON- make sure -PRON- drink be never half full and that -PRON- be satisfied with out meal
the food -PRON- be a nice mix of asian cusine
the portion be big and the food be very tasty
definitely a place to try
love love love
good authentic japanese place -PRON- have ever be to
suck that -PRON- in vegas
x -PRON- would come here all the time if -PRON- be in -PRON- neighborhood
-PRON- always order the yellowtail tar tar
freakin bomb~~~
the yaki udon be pretty good too
beef tataki be -PRON- boyfriend 's favorite
so -PRON- order 2
the shrimp fry rice be good
personally -PRON- can not be amazed by fry rice
-PRON- just fry rice
-PRON- split a raman which be pretty good too do not remember what else -PRON- order but at the end for dessert -PRON- have to get the brick toast
one be good enough for 4 of -PRON- cuz -PRON- eat so much
will always come here if -PRON- be in vegas
do not care that -PRON- off the strip do not care if there be always at least 30min to an hour
wait
so freakin worth it
love
this
place
-PRON- be not cheap and -PRON- be pretty sure -PRON- have a mild heart attack from all the fat and sodium -PRON- ingest but oh so worth -PRON-
not the good cut of meat and some piece be a bit fatty but this be pretty much a meat lover paradise
-PRON- go here as part of a ginormous 30-person party and everything go pretty smoothly consider -PRON- group 's size
the staff be very professional and try to keep everything straight even though thing get a little bit hectic
can not wait to return
super easy to get -PRON- rental car and get out
the shuttle be very quick both way to the airport
this be a great idea for big airport
amazing corktown bistro know primarily for -PRON- burger -PRON- be a house specialty perfectly cook top with thick slice of bacon on a delicious bun
do not forget -PRON- dijon mustard
clear the sinus but go amazingly well with the hand cut fry
comfort food in an upscale bistro atmosphere
the chicken be a safe bet as be the daily or weekly special -PRON- have on the menu
lunch menu be even good as the burger without bacon -PRON- believe be more reasonably price
service be generally quite attentive
-PRON- be a small cozy space which can fill up so -PRON- generally not a bad idea to call ahead if -PRON- be make dinner plan there
highly recommend great spot in the city close to the bayview extension dvp and gardiner
a must try if -PRON- be in the area and worth the drive if -PRON- be not
-PRON- just hope -PRON- do not get too popular
great place
go in for a gel manicure
service be top notch the staff be friendly and attentive
the salon be very clean
-PRON- give -PRON- some fun idea for -PRON- accent nail and -PRON- have receive many compliment this week
-PRON- highly recommend westgate nail salon
amazing thai food in vegas
-PRON- do not think anyone can beat this place
fantastic line up for wine
great for business dinner as well
for a restaurant with wing in the name -PRON- be expect more
-PRON- order honey bbq wing with a side of fry
the honey bbq sauce be odd taste more like mild hot sauce with absolutely no flavor
-PRON- would possibly try this place again as the restaurant be clean and the server be attentive but would never order wing again
the first time -PRON- come to the meadow bar be a the beginning of a pub crawl in -PRON- first year
-PRON- be a comfortable pub with quick service plenty of comfrotable seating and a chill out atmosphere
importantly the drink be very reasonably price in order to lure the student away from -PRON- class in the nearby george square
-PRON- all have a few drink in here get slightly rowdy which be take well by the staff and then head off
since then -PRON- have be here for lunch a few time
and -PRON- can certainly recommend -PRON- ham and cheese paninis which be big crispy and full
whether -PRON- be after a drink in the evening or a tasty bite for lunch the meadow bar be the place
upon arrival everything seem great
once check in the guy ask for $ 100 deposit when -PRON- already pay for everything online
i. total $ 206 spend on a motel
a motel
still expect to pay $ 8 after check -PRON- be very absurd
-PRON- was\/am very upset because -PRON- be pay way to much to be receive way too little
there may be an update review to see how thing turn out
pro about this place be -PRON- look decent enough to sleep good at night
that be about -PRON-
-PRON- love this store
-PRON- be -PRON- go to for crystal
-PRON- like that -PRON- be close by home and the staff be always helpful
the good be not good plus mess up -PRON- kid order
sorry to say but employee seem so dumb
first time come here with a friend
nice atmosphere for hang out
service be good -PRON- ask for recommendation as -PRON- be -PRON- first time here
-PRON- suggest the fresh mozzarella meatball spaghetti pasta and the butcher pizza
-PRON- decide to try out with buratta fresh mozzarella and capri pasta
the bread for mozzarella be really good with the honey flavour
-PRON- do not think -PRON- would get -PRON- again because -PRON- be too cheesy for -PRON-
capri pasta with seafood be average wish the dish be hot -PRON- be just barely warm
overall the food be average but -PRON- be a nice atmosphere to chat and relax with friend so -PRON- may come back again and try something else
-PRON- pizza look good -PRON- would probably get that with charity bread next time
well -PRON- would give -PRON- 5 star because of all the different performer and concert -PRON- have which be awesome but -PRON- 5 star go down to 3 due to the false advertisement of -PRON- promoter and the rude worker that be there
-PRON- come here 3 time
and -PRON- have different experience each time
the music be awesome and the crowd be great
but -PRON- realize -PRON- do not close off the guest line when -PRON- reach a certain capacity
-PRON- be wayyyyyy toooo crowd and there be literally no place to dance unless -PRON- go outside near the pool area
luckily -PRON- know someone that have a vip table so -PRON- could actually be able to dance and sit down every once in a while
-PRON- be very upset at a couple of promoter that approach -PRON- while walk the strip
-PRON- be tell as long as -PRON- get there before 12 than -PRON- can get in for free because -PRON- be on the guest list but -PRON- show up at 11:20pm -PRON- check -PRON- id 's by 11:35pm and -PRON- finally get to the front to pay\/give -PRON- name for the guest list by 11:43pm
and -PRON- tell -PRON- -PRON- be too late
-PRON- can not get in because -PRON- should have be there earlier
-PRON- be so mad and embarrassed because -PRON- either have to get out of line or pay $ 45
the worker be very rude to -PRON- because -PRON- be just ask a question and be try to figure out why the promoter say -PRON- could get in but than -PRON- say -PRON- could not
-PRON- even show -PRON- the text message that the promoter send -PRON- and the name and the asian girl tell the security that -PRON- have to go
-PRON- be such a waste of a night
-PRON- really want the manager to see this message and talk to that girl about -PRON- attitude because -PRON- treat -PRON- so bad
-PRON- never want to come back here again
-PRON- husband and -PRON- decide on cupcake for -PRON- wedding 2 year ago and -PRON- choose to stop by the cake artist studio simply because -PRON- drive by there every day on -PRON- way to school and be curious
-PRON- be not sure that -PRON- do this anymore but -PRON- send -PRON- home with a box of cake sample and -PRON- be sooo good
-PRON- decide to go with -PRON- instead of try anywhere else first
the buttercream icing be amazing
-PRON- choose vanilla cupcake with strawberry chocolate and vanilla
buttercream
some with strawberry some not just in case people do not like -PRON-
-PRON- will not go into too much detail because -PRON- be go to post some picture
-PRON- be amazing people still talk about -PRON-
-PRON- have be a member at cornell cc for 3 month now
of all the markham cc -PRON- would say this one be the good
the fitness facility be clean bright lot of window and this be the only cc in markham that have a large enough stretch\/open space area for self directed\/mat work out
the change room be for the most part clean however the bathroom be hit and miss
there have be a number of time where -PRON- be not well maintain or toilet paper\/soap have run out
the staff member be friendly
-PRON- usually go during weekday evening between 6 7
and -PRON- be never pack
-PRON- have not have to wait for a cardio machine or equipment so far
overall -PRON- be a fan of this place
-PRON- beat a lot of those chain gym like goodlife or fit for less that be pack and humid during peak hour
-PRON- be on the flexible plan month to month and -PRON- cost -PRON- the same as gl or ffl
parking be never an issue and easy
-PRON- love this place
-PRON- be a total sucker for nice hot dog so -PRON- be right up -PRON- alley
if -PRON- be one of those people that say omg how can -PRON- charge 7 dollar for just a hot dog maybe just do not go to place like this
-PRON- be not suppose to be a competitor of hot dog cart
-PRON- be a good thing
and so -PRON- cost more
just get -PRON- xmas tree
85 degree do not bother -PRON-
free candy cane and great price
ask for randy and jerry for the good tree and service
awesome growler station great beer selection the good -PRON- have see anywhere actually price be a bit cheap for some product depend on what -PRON- be look for
einer meiner absoluten lieblingsläden vorallem da es pauls boutique taschen und klamotten gibt

ansonsten gibt es schöne teilweiße ausgefallene mode für frau und mann bei der ich auch gerne mal etwa mehr bezahle
auf jedenfall mal vorbeischaun

the croissant 3.5 sort of a small pastry and disappointingly deflated presentation
nice crispness and butteriness though
try -PRON- late in the afternoon
so the morning may yield a good product
but -PRON- be not among the good in toronto
marvista rental have be nothing but great as current tenant
-PRON- be responsive to any request easily reachable and have wonderfully renovate apartment
-PRON- move in august 2016 and have be happy with -PRON- since
ruddddddde staff
ridiculous price
go elsewhere if -PRON- do not want to be treat terribly
also
terrible location
try sweet factory in the beachwood mall
also what be up with try to sell the same thing as -PRON- neighbor sweet surprises
not a good way to run a business
5\/1\/15-
-PRON- would like to make -PRON- reply to laura public
-PRON- have three friend on yelp -PRON- be not sure which one -PRON- think run a candy store but -PRON- be prettty positive do of -PRON- do
as far as -PRON- agreement not to sell melt chocolate cover thing -PRON- pass yesterday and there be a large sign in -PRON- window suggest that -PRON- do
so -PRON- repeat mess with a business that have be there over 20 year be very very rude
food be okay but table be always dirty
sometimes -PRON- act like -PRON- do not want to take -PRON- order
go here a couple of week ago with -PRON- husband we'd be mean to try -PRON- for awhile
-PRON- sit inside -PRON- forget why but in the future -PRON- think -PRON- would try to avoid -PRON- -PRON- have this set up with a long bench along the wall table and chair on the face side which give -PRON- more of a fast food feel than -PRON- really like plus the table be tiny
-PRON- feel like -PRON- be be squash into people on both side of -PRON- and -PRON- be noisy
-PRON- split an order of chip fry before the meal and -PRON- be amazing
really well do just the right texture for -PRON- relatively thin for home make chip but still just a little soft like -PRON- like -PRON- not too many burn one and -PRON- come with a delicious vinegar infuse aoli for dipping
husband have some beer that -PRON- really like and obviously that be -PRON- main deal
-PRON- have some wine and -PRON- be okay
but -PRON- remember think that the selection be pretty thin
-PRON- realize -PRON- be not -PRON- primary thing but -PRON- could have have a little more variety
for the entree -PRON- have the grill cheese with a shot of -PRON- harvest tomato soup
-PRON- do not realize when -PRON- order that -PRON- literally mean a shot like -PRON- be serve in a shot glass which be incredibly inconvenient since -PRON- be nearly impossible to dip the sandwich in -PRON- even shred into small piece
what do -PRON- think people do with grill cheese and tomato soup
the container really need a broad mouth even if -PRON- have hold the same volume
the soup be really good very flavorful just a hint of spice very nice
the server also say -PRON- think that -PRON- be vegan although -PRON- could not confirm -PRON- say the chef like to do vegan stuff when -PRON- can
the grill cheese though be really disappointing
the menu list three kind of cheese include cheddar but -PRON- just have no flavor at all
totally bland
-PRON- would have be happy with a full bowl of the soup
if -PRON- do not like to be crowd -PRON- would recommend try to sit outside in the next few month rather than inside
and avoid the grill cheese
love wingstop
got to order the wing and fry well do in -PRON- opinion
the food be always consistant garlic parm lemon pepper and the new spicy koran q be awesome
-PRON- experience the same thing as the previous poster
the low quote rate be for -PRON- own ktx insurance which then after agree orally to the rate over the phone proceed to bill -PRON- a high rate and send -PRON- a contract with inaccurate information on -PRON- expect -PRON- to sign
beware
-PRON- receive the dermaplan treatment and -PRON- be great
not only be the treatment -PRON- great but also the ambience of the loft add to -PRON- wonderful experience
after brunch -PRON- do a little shopping and be debate what to do afterwards when -PRON- cous have a brilliant idea
foot
massage\/reflexology\/whatever -PRON- want to call -PRON-
hell
yeah
-PRON- pick a spot in chinatown and go with zhen zhen
-PRON- be $ 30.00 for an hour foot massage but that be a little misleading
if -PRON- break -PRON- down -PRON- be about 10 minute of get -PRON- foot soak in hot water then about 35 minute of massage
so just keep that in mind when -PRON- go
yes -PRON- know that do not add up to an hour
do the math
-PRON- have to walk up a flight of stair to get to zhen zhen
the inside have a mix of room for massage and open style door for foot massage
-PRON- end up get one male for -PRON- and female practitioner for -PRON- cous
pressure be pretty good and -PRON- definitely get a few tender spot
-PRON- guess -PRON- expect -PRON- to tip -PRON- because -PRON- be grumble in chinese when -PRON- only drop one bill instead of two
either way -PRON- be cash only
-PRON- have not be to any other foot place in town so hard to compare
but this one be decent enough
3.5 star
-PRON- do the nighttime tour of old scottsdale tonight and have an awesome time

the business model and customer service be superb

the selection be usually pretty good here
a few of the thing -PRON- love be the satisfaction guarantee the meat selection and the coupon book

the eye center staff be very rude the staff at the return desk can sometimes make -PRON- feel like a criminal
-PRON- be 100 satisfaction guarantee enough say
there be a ton of old people
-PRON- mean bus load
seriously get the hell out of the way or build a senior costco in sun city for gods sake
-PRON- have also have cashier not give -PRON- the coupon discount on a couple occasion
and then -PRON- have to wait in an abandon line for a manager to come and credit -PRON- back
-PRON- be a real hassle on the customer part
other than those issue costco obviously be a great place to shop at for bulk item and speak for -PRON-
if -PRON- be seriously read this review try to decide if -PRON- be for -PRON- then -PRON- must be new to america or planet earth
-PRON- recently move to lakewood and this park be one of the reason why
-PRON- be vast and beautiful and -PRON- can walk on the path along the lake and look in the binocular at the boat and downtown cleveland
-PRON- visit before -PRON- move and feel like -PRON- be on vacation every time -PRON- go there

-PRON- aisle be full of accessory and apparel and be organize
kudos to the guy who arrange the store
-PRON- do a great job
-PRON- look great
-PRON- gun be consistently the cheap in town and -PRON- staff be knowledgeable
a couple of guy give bad review but -PRON- just sound like sour grape to -PRON-
-PRON- can not always have everything -PRON- want
when -PRON- do not -PRON- try -PRON- good to help -PRON- even if -PRON- mean send -PRON- to a competitor or a specific website
and if -PRON- do have -PRON- -PRON- will be the cheap in town
this be why -PRON- will only shop here and if -PRON- happen to not have what -PRON- want then -PRON- will wait until -PRON- do
if -PRON- be in the market to buy a gun make sure -PRON- go to discount firearms

have an appointment set then get text message 30 min prior asking can -PRON- come later
not know what later be -PRON- call the rep to inquire when -PRON- could make -PRON- and be advise -PRON- do not know yet when that would be
no apology for the last minute request either
if -PRON- can not make schedule work to make a sale good luck on a pool build\/remodel go anywhere close to plan
-PRON- try out circus circus because -PRON- have the cheap deal for a busy weekend
on top of that -PRON- give -PRON- free buffet too bad -PRON- do not get to experience that due to -PRON- busy weekend
the staff be great hardly any kid where -PRON- be at
-PRON- believe there may be two side to circus circus
-PRON- room be on the skyrise section with a nice window view
the room be decent which i think be okay due to the fact that -PRON- would not be in -PRON- room much besides go to bed or get ready to go out
-PRON- also have a spacious restroom and cable tv
check in and out be a breeze
the line move fairly quickly
the only con be the loud ac
-PRON- stay here for the first time over the weekend since -PRON- be run one of the good deal in vegas
this be normally rare -PRON- have find over a few year with this hotel since -PRON- seem to book well due to the location near the convention center
-PRON- be familiar with the hotel before stay here for the first time
-PRON- love the buffet and the gambling area be not too shabby
the sport betting be a great place to have some fun and watch the game over the weekend
now with -PRON- hotel room -PRON- become quickly unimpressed with the hotel sadly
once -PRON- arrive -PRON- check -PRON- in
and -PRON- be off to the north tower
once inside -PRON- want to place a wake up call
but nobody ever pick up
the room have a nice makeover but -PRON- be miss part like the gear cover to -PRON- door
then move to the bathroom the bath be chip all over the place and lack paint on about 15 of -PRON-
get in around 2:00am -PRON- go on a hunt for a quick drink before -PRON- head back to bed and could not figure out how to get one
all and all book the hilton for pure convenience or a star trek wedding
if -PRON- stick at the convention center for a huge convention like sema where the taxi line have more people in -PRON- than all the strip clubs in clark county -PRON- will be glad -PRON- pick the hilton hotel
if -PRON- want luxury feeling or any kind of service -PRON- should look elsewhere
-PRON- happen to be pass by when -PRON- see hibachi grill
think -PRON- be teppan style -PRON- decide to check -PRON-
-PRON- be surprised to see that -PRON- be an all -PRON- can eat buffet chinese sushi mongolian grill seafood crab leg crab oyster clam shrimp mussel salad dimsum american and dessert bar with blue bunny ice cream
the place be big and kid friendly
-PRON- be casual
so -PRON- do not have to worry what -PRON- be wear
-PRON- family enjoy -PRON- because of the variety of selection
compare to other chinese buffet this place have a lot of food to choose from and the price be very reasonable
because of that -PRON- will definitely come back
-PRON- get a gel manicure do last week the next day -PRON- top coat bubble up and two day later start to tear

most of what can be say probably have so -PRON- will only add that -PRON- be very grateful to have a place like this locally
the owner be incredibly nice and -PRON- make sure to put out the real deal
try friday when -PRON- do cajun specialty
-PRON- have slow cook turkey leg cajun style and where else be -PRON- go to find that
-PRON- love the po boy and the dirty rice too
only a somewhat cautionary note the ambience be below par but -PRON- still do not feel -PRON- be fair to lower the rating
in a perfect world -PRON- would find a financial partner in order to be able to have a nice location and still provide the same quality food in a nice setting
-PRON- be a little skeptical of this place base on the fact that -PRON- only seat about 20 people
the review however be fantastic
-PRON- give -PRON- a try
-PRON- be not disappoint
-PRON- have the pizza which be amazing
-PRON- can eat much more than the average person and -PRON- still get the meat sweat after only 3 piece
the rest of -PRON- group have lasagna
-PRON- all say -PRON- be one of the good -PRON- have
very attentive staff
if -PRON- love to crush amazing italian food with large portion this be -PRON- place
peace
kiltlifter
remain -PRON- favorite and most hangover inducing beer
waitstaff
remain the most attractive in the valley
food
remain the good of any brewery -PRON- have visit although santan be close the gap
-PRON- just wish the place have not blow up the way -PRON- have -PRON- use to be able to just walk in and sit down anywhere -PRON- could find a table
now there be a hostess a waiting list those vibrate coaster thing etc
maybe -PRON- will add a second level
-PRON- be sure the apartment dweller across the street would love that
-PRON- wife and -PRON- stop by earl 's for lunch
once -PRON- order
and -PRON- take about 20 minute to order
-PRON- wait another 35 minute to get -PRON- food -PRON- just order 2 burger with fry
and one of the frustrating thing about the wait be the food runner be also empty out the garbage and naturally -PRON- spend about 5 minute do that and the next thing -PRON- do be bring -PRON- food to -PRON-
so that be pretty creepy
and on top of that the burger and fry be serve at good barely warm
so -PRON- have to have be sit for awhile before be serve
-PRON- be guess -PRON- be sit there the whole time the server be play with the trash can
and once -PRON- arrive truly nothing special about the burger
the fry be just meh and the burger not that good either
-PRON- be very disappointed in the food and waste an hour incur that disappointment
there be get to be good place to eat in cave creek
awesome place to go
visit from la cali wife have some strange three part thing one be make with hops
need to tell -PRON- brother who grow -PRON- own in the uk for home brew
real good burger
though -PRON- should step into the 21st century and realize that tabasco be not the only hot sauce brand
honestly -PRON- be like l&l but way over price
the only thing -PRON- have that l&l do not be the poke
restaurant be very awkward maybe -PRON- should play some music
other wise everything be alright
most reasonably price and delicious italian food in chandler
-PRON- serve pitcher of beer too
bonus
pepperoni muffins be the bomb
definitely on -PRON- list of place to go out for dinner from now on
great low key vibe too
